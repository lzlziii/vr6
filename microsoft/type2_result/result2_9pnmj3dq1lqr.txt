description: In the last century it was common to spend an evening viewing stereographs or stereoscope images (3D pictures) of various locations, events, and people.  We are bringing this experience into a VR environment and bringing history to life!    There are thousands of images and we will build out a library over time, for now please have a look and leave a review.  We are still working on the experience and any feedback is welcome.  You may have some difficulty viewing some images in 3D - we are working on solutions as this may be due to the way the original image was taken (parallax).  If you have a request for additional images please let us know.  Images and audio are off copy-write and available from the Library of Congress.  Many thanks and we hope you enjoy!
