description: HoloLens Data Visualization application helps in visualizing the data in 3D world. User can interact with data models using HoloLens gestures, voice commands and mouse (for desktop users).   ********************************************************************* HoloLens Mode ********************************************************************* Use gaze to focus an object and use either air tap  or 'Next' voice command to interact with selected object  Select the Data Model Source to explore the data models available for that data source      There are 3 ways to connect to data models 1. In-built Data Models  There are 4 in-built data models available with application 2. On-disk Data Models  Save up to 4 data models in JSON format in pictures/Camera Roll folder     Sample models are created in this folder on first application launch  You can modify the contents as per your requirements of your device  3. Web Service End Point  Enter up to 4 Web Service end points in HDV-EndPointConfig.json file located in pictures/Camera Roll folder  to connect to your data models on Web.
