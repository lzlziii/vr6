name: Solids, Liquids, Gases: Oh My!
description: Warning: App may cause motion sickness.  Pan for glittering gold at Reed Gold Mine--America’s first gold mine! Learn about the Mohs Scale while classifying various minerals underground in an actual mine tunnel. Also, see the heavy equipment used to ease the back-breaking work of panning and sorting.  Zoom around the racetrack while answering questions based on unit content appearing in the lanes ahead. Correct answer choices earn points while speeding along this highway of inquiry.  Distinguish between solids, liquids, and gases while viewing various forms of the substances. Chemical reactions also play a role determining form of various states of matter.  Standing room only for the First Lady of Physics, Chien-Shiung Wu, who made significant contributions to the physics field. See why weak forces are dominant in nuclear fission in this virtual reality comic book.  No shame in being dense in this lab. Comparing density of different objects helps explain phase changes--and there’s even a real turtle to assist in this production.  As always, VictoryVR curriculum is stimulating and fun! Better yet, it’s rooted in the Next Gen Science Standards so it is directly linked with science teachings in today’s classrooms.
