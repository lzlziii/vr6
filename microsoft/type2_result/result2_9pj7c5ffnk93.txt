description: When you strap on the headset, you will be transported to our underwater aquatic research facility. Try not to be distracted by the fish and other creatures as you take off on an adventure inside the human body.    Been to the jungles of Mexico before? Well, the virtual field trip visits both the jungles of Mexico and the magical Singapore Gardens as you learn about the hierarchy of multicellular organisms. Yeah, we get it:  that may not sound interesting but when you’re on a boat traveling deep into the jungle, suddenly it becomes very interesting.   Wendy the Science Teacher explores the phenomenon of Chiropractic and the science behind its impact on your body.   And that which is too small for the human eye to see suddenly gets very large as viruses are explored in an amazing interactive experience. If you’ve ever wondered what influenza (the flu) really looks like, now you will go toe to toe with it in your own battle.   The stories examine the systems of the body including circulatory, reproductive, respiratory along with others. How each of these systems operates in our body is a fascinating look at the organic functions that make humans go. This trip inside the human body is like no trip you have ever experienced. So buckle yourself in and get ready for your adventure inside the human body!
