name: Aurore - Real Estate VR Experience
description: -- This is a technical preview version --  What is Aurore?  The mysterious sounding name originates in the French language and stands for red of dawn.  This magical state, just before the sun rises, is something we got inspired of because it entails a certain kind of beauty we want to share with you.  Aurore is the world’s first Mixed Reality Real Estate Application that is going to introduce you to a stunning place you possibly could live in in the future.   Are you interested in buying a beautiful summer residence in southern France but you just don’t have the time to travel once around the globe?  We got you covered! With Aurore and Mixed Reality you can now have a look at your place of interest and really be there without having to leave your home.  What makes this experience special is our technology of room-scale VR, with 6 degrees of freedom (6DOF), a fully customizable surrounding, and an artificial intelligence, that is going to guide you through the apartment.  In short, while you move around freely in your future flat and explore every detail of it you can interact with Charles, your personal assistant Ava who has an answer to all of your questions.    We all know the situation: You are viewing an apartment and you like it, but you are wondering how it would look like with a marble floor, white windows or simply a leather sofa? Circumstances that were left to your imagination we can let you visualize now. Switch to the customize-mode and make your dream room become reality.
