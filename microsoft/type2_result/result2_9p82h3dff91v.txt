description: With Water VR you can experience the single most important molecule on Earth – the water molecule – on a molecular level, in a virtual reality. Learn how and why water molecules can assemble themselves into different arrangements (or phases) such as ice, liquid and gas. It’s a fully interactive experience were you also can build your own water molecule, orient waters into perfect hydrogen-bond networks and enter the chaotic gas phase by cranking up the temperature.  Water VR is a virtual reality app tailored towards K-12 chemistry education, specifically the 7th grade.   Please note that using virtual reality (VR) without supervision in a crowded space can be risky, since you cannot see the outside world with VR goggles on. VR systems can make some users feel motion sickness. We suggest a 10 minute break every 30 minutes, even if you don't think you need it.
