description: Step inside the giant ARC Telescope at Apache Point Observatory to get a glimpse of how this amazing technology works! The public is not allowed inside, so prepare to be an astrophysicist for this experience.  Zip and zoom through outer space, traveling the planets, Sun, and Moon at your own pace. See what distinguishes each of these celestial orbs from one another.  Gravity, mass, and orbits--the trilogy of space physics comes to life in this piece that highlights hemispheres, seasons, lunar eclipses phases, eclipses, and so much more.  Can you name the planets in order of size? Master this info and more as you review planetary sequences, as well as each orb’s unique characteristics.  See the scale and orbit pacing of planets in this student-oriented interstellar recreation. Learn about the different planets, how they got their names, and other characteristics in this 360* virtual video.  As always, VictoryVR curriculum is stimulating and fun! Better yet, it’s rooted in the Next Gen Science Standards so it is directly linked with science teachings in today’s classrooms.
