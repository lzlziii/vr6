name: Loci AR Mind Map
description: What - Use Loci to Link In Your Mind. See https://iform.us. Loci is a method of loci mixed reality mind mapping application located around you. It combines the method of loci memory technique and 3D mixed reality interaction with mind maps (graphs) to support you on your personal analysis tasks. These tasks can include looking for an apartment, finding out more about a disease, or deciding on a next job. Loci features initial import capability for MindManager, Freemind, and GraphML files.   Why - Loci uses three core concepts to help you organize, understand and recall; mind maps lets you break a problem down into component parts to organize and do analysis, mixed reality interaction with mind maps lets you visualize in 3D to understand how they are related, and the method of loci persistent placement of mind map nodes lets you improve your recall of the mind map, even when you are not using the Loci software. In this way you can organize your problem, understand it, and remember it later when you need to use that information for decisions.  How - Loci is built for Windows Mixed Reality. Loci supports spatial mapping so you can place nodes from your mind maps in relevant locations in your memory palace. Loci uses voice, gaze and gestures to enable you to make your 3D graphs (mind maps). You start by saying "add node" to make a node representing the problem you are working on, then you look at this node and again say "add node" to add more nodes for attributes of the problem, so you have a visualization of your problem. You can say "capture image" to add nodes with images using the camera, or say "load image" add nodes with images from files. You can link nodes together to show how they are related to each other. To load and save mind maps you use File Explorer or OneDrive. To help you understand how Loci works, it has a seven day free trial.  Where - Where you place and do things is very important to your memory. Locations in your memory palace are important to you. They have meaning that you effectively recall, and with Loci you can combine your visual and spatial memory.  When - Loci helps you on longer term problems you are working on, where you need to apply your capabilities for cognition. You may return to these problems over a span of weeks or months to arrive at the right decision. You use Loci when you have set aside time to do deep analysis at home or work.  Who - If you are solving complex problems, produce complex things, or purchasing complex items or services, such as cars, houses, college, stocks, or medical treatment, you could benefit by organizing, understanding, and recalling your information using Loci.
