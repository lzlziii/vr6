name: Freezing Rotation Illusion in 3D
description: Visual illusions are a good mean to demonstrate some of the engineering shortcuts in our brain. Almost all of the known visual illusions are evoked by using a two-dimensional (2D) presentation. Take as example the "Freezing Rotation Illusion". Here a physically continuously turning foreground object (e.g. an image of an airplane) is perceived as slowing down (freezing) and speeding up, while its surround (e.g. the image of a greenhouse) is rotating back and forth.  When using a 3-dimensional turning airplane model with different back and forth rotating surroundings, which are the best conditions for the Freezing Rotation Illusion to occur?  Firstly, which is the optimal surround? Wedges in randomly chosen sizes and colors or are combined to build a tubular and/or a disk shaped surround. Another choice is a 360° x 180° panorama of a green-house. Secondly, should the airplane and its surround be in about the same depth plane, i.e. in about the same distance from the observer or not? Thirdly, how much the airplane and its surrounding have to overlap for the illusion still to arise? Can we look from the side and still get the illusion?
