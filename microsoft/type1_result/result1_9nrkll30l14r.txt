description: Enjoy the beauty of visual arrangements created by Curtis Steiner using a virtual set of blocks from his 1000 Blocks exhibit at the Seattle Art Museum.  Participate in the art by rearranging your own set of virtual blocks. Use your imagination to apply the unique visual language encoded in these block "pixels“ to make a visual pattern, a drawing, a written message or anything else you can imagine.  This app was developed in part during the Microsoft Hackathon, with design guidance and mentoring from The Microsoft Garage.  To learn more about the app and the code behind it, visit the project website.
