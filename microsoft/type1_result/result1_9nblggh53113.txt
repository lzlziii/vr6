name: HoloTire
description: Have you ever wanted to explore the features and capabilities of a product before it’s available in stores?  We created HoloTire to demonstrate how new products such as an automobile tire, can be presented virtually as 3D holograms, for marketing and training purposes. The user sees the tire integrated into their real world environment at 1:1 (actual) scale. The demonstration allows users to explore key features and technology of the tire using animated visualizations, simple voice commands, and natural hand gestures.  • Touching the holographic tire with your own hand will stop the tire from spinning. • Users can say "reset demo" to start over from the beginning.  • "Face me" will automatically orient the tire towards the user. • Other available voice commands are shown in context of the current scene.
