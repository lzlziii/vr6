name: Board Games VR
description: Play board games in virtual reality.  Currently the only games available to play are backgammon and checkers, which take place in a room.  Please note that you might need a chair to sit on when playing the game. In which case, try not to injure yourself.  Development of this game started as a hobby project to chill, play backgammon. After a while I decided to share this game and its experience with the world... So, enjoy the game and if you happen to have constructive feedback, share it here and watch it happen over time! ,)
