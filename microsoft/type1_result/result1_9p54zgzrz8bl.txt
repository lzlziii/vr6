name: Fuzor AR
description: Fuzor HoloLens App is now compatible with HoloLens 1 and HoloLens 2. It uses position-locking by both a QR code scanning or using two-points method. Your model can be adjusted accurately with gestures or voice commands and can be presented at a 1:1 scale to a 1:1000 scale for flexible use. To maximize AR usability, parts of the model can be isolated so you can focus the most important components and support annotation for saving your important notes to record any comments you want to make. In addition, this app also integrates build sequence that uses your existing 4D schedule for on-site training purposes.
