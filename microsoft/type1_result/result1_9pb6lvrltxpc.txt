description: Bridge makes it easy to present 3D models to other people in your environment.  Thanks to augmented reality, Bridge allows you to bring and present your 3D models in your real environment.  Share this experience with other people : move, rotate, and scale your 3D models in real time. Indicate points of interest on top of the model thanks to your laser pointer.  Bridge allows you to work locally or remotely. Your teammates will be represented as avatars, and you too. Interact with your models while continuing to talk and hear each other.  Bridge is the first cross-platform augmented reality application. It is available on Smartglasses (Microsoft Hololens, Magic Leap, DAQRI), on Smartphones & Tablets (iOS, Android), and on Desktops (Windows, MacOs).   Bridge offers a complete workflow, from sending your custom 3D files to viewing them in the real world. Learn more on : http://bridge.immersiv.io
