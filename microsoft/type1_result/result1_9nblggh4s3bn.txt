name: Tower Blocks (beta)
description: Play Tower Blocks multiplayer! Use HoloLens' hand gestures to grab blocks from the stack and then balance them on top. It's fun together with your friends or solo!   The player picks up a block with one hand and can move it. At the same time, the player is able to use his/her second hand to rotate the block in a natural way.  An introductory tutorial will guide the user through the interactions once the experience is launched for the first time. The tutorial can also be opened again at any time by saying "Show Tutorial".  This holographic game experiments with hand interactions allows to use a second hand to create an intuitive way to interact with holograms.   In order to play a session of Tower Blocks multiplayer, the hosting user selects Mulitplayer > Start. The other players just select Mulitplayer > Join. The peer-to-peer connection will be established automatically if the participating HoloLens devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network and the network allows broadcasts. If the auto connect fails, the app will allow to enter the IP address of the hosting player which will be shown in the view of the hosting player.   Tower Blocks is in beta and improvements will follow.
