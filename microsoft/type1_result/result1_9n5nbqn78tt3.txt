Play your way through your various work days where you sell ice cream to kids, make vegetarian pizzas, deliver newspapers, chop wood, catch fish, destroy someones lawnmower and various other shenanigans. We don’t judge, but we certainly encourage you to destroy EVERYTHING! After all - you’re the master of #Archery in VR. Don’t try this IRL.
