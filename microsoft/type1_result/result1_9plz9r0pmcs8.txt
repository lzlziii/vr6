description: Cyber Snake is a re-imagining of the classic 2D Snake game... in Mixed Reality! Play as the glorious CyberSnake™ (in first person) as you hunt for CyberBurgers™ around your environment. Just beware of the CyberTail™ that grows out the back of your skull and follows you around!  Other features include Ice Dreams™ - collect one and say "Believe In Your Dreams" to summon a Motivational Vortex, sucking in all the nearby burgers and causing a huge explosion. If you're a bit lost because of the low field-of-view, you can also say "Help me!" to find out where your tail lurks.  Want innovative bugs? We have them too! Make sure that you're playing in a clear area so nothing spawns into furniture. Also, the HoloLens was never designed for this amount of motion, so you might lose tracking here and there - all part of the plan! Bugs make it all the more fun!  This game was made by Lucas Rizzotto and you should totally reach out to him @ contact@lucasrizzotto.com (or follow him on Twitter @_lucasrizzotto).
