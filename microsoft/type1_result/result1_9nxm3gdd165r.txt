description: Hypercade brings a modern spin to nostalgic arcade action in VR, with simple to use controls paired with classic arcade challenge. Play four incredible arcade classics completely hands free or with a controller. Brought to you by acclaimed VR game developer Hidden Path Entertainment, Hypercade includes four arcade games, each with its own unique take on fan favorites of yesteryear.   Dodge dive-bombing aliens in Space Swarm, a classic vertical shooter featuring waves of unique enemy flight formations and challenging special bonus stages. Evade the onslaught of multi-legged creatures in Crazy Critters, but beware - shoot them in the middle and they'll divide in half! Save humanity from homicidal robots in Robot Rush, a classic twin-stick shooter featuring a unique hands-free mode. Maneuver your paddle with a glance as you deflect a bouncing crystal to smash through walls of gems and collect special powerups in Breaker Blaster.
