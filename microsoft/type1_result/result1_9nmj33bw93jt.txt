name: 1600
description: The White House's "1600" is a new way for kids and playful Americans of all ages to learn about what happens at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. All you need to do is tap "Start" and point your camera at George Washington (on the one dollar bill).  Built through a collaboration with the White House Historical Association and Nexus Studios, the app’s aim is to educate and inspire the youngest Americans to learn more about the White House's role in our democracy. Our hope is that whether it is experienced on a teacher's desk or dining room table, kids walk away from "1600" with a better sense of the institution and its purpose. Not to mention, a smile.  Tip: Move around to explore from different angles, and airtap the Oval Office to reveal a surprise.
