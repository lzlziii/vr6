description: Coming from independent roots, QuiVr has quickly become one of the success stories of the VR community. One of the top selling and most popular multiplayer VR games in 2017, QuiVr puts the incredibly satisfying power of real-world archery mechanics into your hands. Tasked with defending your people against an army of invading monsters, all that stands between life and death is your skill, your allies, and the powerful equipment you'll earn along the way. Supported by one of the most active and engaged online communities in VR, QuiVr offers seamless drop-in co-op play with a large enough community that you'll rarely fight alone if you don't want to. Frequently the #1 or #2 game in nearly every VR arcade where it is offered, QuiVr is the game of choice for both VR veterans and newcomers alike. Discover what thousands of VR fans already have.  Note: Requires Windows Mixed Reality Motion Controllers
