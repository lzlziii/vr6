description: Experience a new era of Mixed Reality Aided Engineering! Mixed Reality provides a modern, natural and effective way of understanding complex 3D structures and devices.   With HoloEngine, you can see an engine floating in the air. You can start the engine, change its speed and even peek inside to see how the pistons work. The app allows you to move, rotate and even resize the engine in your environment, but you can also use your own feet to examine it from every direction. Use gestures or voice commands to control the engine.  Don't forget to try the "About the Team" feature, and get to know the 360world Team - at least our holographic representations!
