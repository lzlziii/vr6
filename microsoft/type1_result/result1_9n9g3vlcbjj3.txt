name: HoloElements
description: HoloElements is a whole new way to look at the periodic table. Designed specifically for HoloLens, using gaze and air-tap you can select an element from a 3D periodic table. Then, specific information about that element will be presented including a 3D representation of the molecular structure of the chosen element which you can walk around and inspect in detail. The melting point and boiling point of the element are also presented (if applicable) along with a link which will open more information about the element in Microsoft Edge.  This app was designed and developed by students in the Code Cadets group at Canberra Grammar School in Australia: Jack Carey, Joseph Fergusson, Damian Camilleri, Robin Hodda, and Sam Reading-Thompson.
