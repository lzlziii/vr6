description: Assist an ex-space pirate who crashes into your room against the evil Astral Raiders led by Captain Lugg. Build powerful emplacements to destroy, stun, and defend against the pirates as they send ships and drones to defeat you!  Astral Raiders is an Action, Tower-Defense game in Augmented Reality for the Microsoft Hololens! Developed over nine-months as a capstone project for seniors in Drexel University's Digital Media and Computer Science majors. Additionally five team members assisted us with Audio from Drexel's Audio Post Crew club and a concept artist helped us create this amazing game!  Interested in learning more about this project?
