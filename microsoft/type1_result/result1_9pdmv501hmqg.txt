description: Groove Pilot is an interactive spatial music experience taking the old music album format and launching it into virtual space.   Fly around inside 12 specially composed spatial music tracks and unlock them layer by layer, creating an everchanging music mix on the fly - literally! Each unlocked music layer (or stem) also creates a unique visual display driven by real-time audio analysis.  Choose one of 5 funky retro spaceships to pilot your groove, and match that with one of 15 unique visual effects to create your own mood for the groove.   All set among a stunning ever-changing procedurally generated environment.   Groove Pilot is the ultimate AudioVisual Soundtoy that you can play with in multiple ways.
