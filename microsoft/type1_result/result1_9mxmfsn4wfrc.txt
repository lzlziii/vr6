name: Mixed Reality Academy: Project Island
description: Have fun across the full spectrum of mixed reality! This first-of-its-kind app takes advantage of the unique aspects of each device type in the Windows Mixed Reality family. Grab a Microsoft HoloLens, at least one Windows Mixed Reality immersive headset, and some friends to explore and solve challenges together on an island with a few tricks in the sand.  With this app, you can: • Choose your adventure as a HoloLens guide or immersive headset explorer (this multiplayer experience supports up to 3 players in immersive headsets, plus several HoloLens guides). • Experience the full spectrum of mixed reality, from holograms in your real world to full digital immersion. • Learn the power of UWP - a single binary recognizes your device type and delivers a unique experience for each.  This game is the open-source project taught at Mixed Reality Academy sessions during Microsoft Build 2017. You can learn how to create this app and find the source code at aka.ms/mr250.
