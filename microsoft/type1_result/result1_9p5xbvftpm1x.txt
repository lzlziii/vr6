description: The HBR Augmented Reality app launches an interactive AR experience from the pages of Harvard Business Review. Experience augmented reality as you explore the November-December 2017 HBR article “Why Every Organization Needs an Augmented Reality Strategy,” by Michael Porter and James Heppelmann. Simply open the magazine to the article’s AR-enabled illustrations, point your mobile device, and watch the graphics come to life. If you don’t have the magazine, you can download the article directly from the app. Move and tilt your device to see AR’s capabilities in action: Watch an animated X-ray view of a hydraulic power unit, see step-by-step instructions for a repair, and control a robot arm with your touchscreen.
