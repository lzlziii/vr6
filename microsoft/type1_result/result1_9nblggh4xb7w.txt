description: ARails is an augmented reality game to build tracks and simulate vehicle motion within the current physical environment. By adding and adjusting individual track pieces, users can build tracks for trains and roller coasters, roads for cars, and even invisible paths for flying vehicles.  ARails was developed by Jenny Kang, Sonja Khan, Riley Porter, and Nicholas Reiter for the Spring 2016 AR/VR Capstone course at the University of Washington.  Special thanks to the course staff for their help throughout the quarter. Thanks also to Microsoft and the HoloLens team for the opportunity to work with the devices, as well as the resources and help.
