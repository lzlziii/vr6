name: Titan MR
description: "Titan" is a virtual exploration of Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and only moon in the solar system with liquid lakes on it's surface. This application for the Microsoft HoloLens provides a wall-anchored porthole to the outside surface of Titan where Saturn hangs in the sky and a liquid hydrocarbon lakes ripple on the surface. The user can choose interest points to warp across the globe and can fly over the surface via a drone avatar.   This application also supports a Bluetooth-paired Xbox One S controller for alternative controls.  This application is a semifinalist entry in the Unity HoloLens Contest of 2017 by Matt Larson. Jack Morrison contributed the voice for the application and Ethan White contributed sound engineering. The author also thanks the Cassini-Huygens mission and efforts of many researchers who have provided the first detailed understandings of the geography of Titan.
