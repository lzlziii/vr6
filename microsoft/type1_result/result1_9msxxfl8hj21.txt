description: Important: Requires a file picker, such as the OneDrive app, to be installed on your Hololens.   Get a glimpse of data visualisation in a post screen world - import CSV/JSON files and interact with them as immersive, 3-dimensional graphs.   Open files saved in the cloud using a file picker, actively find patterns in your data by changing the dimensions to be displayed and get a better understanding by gazing at data objects and receiving additional info.  This app specifically works well with multidimensional data containing both categorical and numerical dimensions.   Note: The app can only display a maximum of 50 groups/bars at a time. Anything above that will not be displayed.   A few things about data formatting: Missing data values should be left empty. The following file formats are accepted: - CSV (up to 5 MB in size): The file needs to use commas as separators. Do not use an index. The first line defines the column names and hence needs to consist of strings. - JSON (up to 8 MB in size): the file needs to be formatted as follows: one key/value pair per data column/dimension containing the column name as the key and an array of data as the value. All dimensions/columns need to have the same length and the values need to be of the same type.  The file you want to open needs to be uploaded into the location that your file picker accesses. When using OneDrive as a file picker, your files need to be saved in your OneDrive folder.  For a detailed user manual including sample files, please visit the website linked below.
