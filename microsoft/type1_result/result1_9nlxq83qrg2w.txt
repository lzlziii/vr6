name: BIM Creator Demo
description: This is the free demo version of BIM Creator app that implement the concept of BIM (Building Information Modelling). It consists of a standard fbx house model from Revit where each component is embedded with corresponding building data such as type of material, size and cost. Air tapping on a component will reveal the information both in text and sound. User can hide or remove any component such as wall and roof to reveal the contents inside the house. Cortana voice commands to remove a component are “remove” followed by the name of the component such as “roof”, “rafters”, walls”, “windows”, “first floor”, “joists”, “ground floor”, “foundation” and “terrain”. All the components that were hidden can be brought back using the voice command “restore”. User can also visualize the model in real life scale. The Cortana voice command is “go there”. While the cursor is pointing at a spot in the living room area of the scaled model for example, uttering the voice command “go there” will resize the model to full scale with the user standing at the location of the cursor. User can walk around to examine the real-life scale model of surrounding objects. User can navigate to first floor by pointing the cursor at a spot at first floor and use the same voice command “go there”. Finally, the model can be returned to its original model scale and position by using the voice command “zoom out”.
