description: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist empowers technicians to collaborate and solve problems with remote collaborators using Microsoft Teams or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, reducing travel time and cost.  With heads-up, hands-free video calling on Microsoft HoloLens, technicians and remote collaborators on PC or mobile can troubleshoot issues in context. Technicians can also capture and visualize images and videos of their organization’s assets and store them in Common Data Service.    Upon download, users will have access to the 90-day license free trial or use the 30-day trial license provided by your organization, if available. Additionally, both technicians and remote collaborators may need a free or paid version of Microsoft Teams. Additional hardware and license requirements vary for available features and content. After this trial period, the technician will need a paid Remote Assist license, which includes Microsoft Teams and capacity for Common Data Service. For more information on how to purchase Remote Assist, contact a Microsoft representative at 1-888-477-7989 or visit http://aka.ms/GetRemoteAssist  Visit docs.microsoft.com for a complete list of technical requirements.
