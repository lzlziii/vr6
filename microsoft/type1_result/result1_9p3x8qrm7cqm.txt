name: Galaxy Defender for Hololens
description: Defend your planet from Alien ships. See how long you can survive. Very fun first person holographic shooter based on the 2d game Galaxy Defender found at www.cresidio.com.  Our goal with Galaxy Defender for Hololens was to conceptually bring our successful 2d Galaxy Defender game into the 3d world.  One of the things that helped to make the original Galaxy Defender game a success was that it was designed as an endless shooter arcade game. A game where you try to go as far as you can for as long as you can for the amount of time you have. A player who was waiting for a bus or standing in line at Disney could fire up the game and begin playing immediately and get lots of enjoyment shooting and blasting things and collecting power ups. If the user had a few hours to kill they could continue on trying to beat their last high score. We wanted to bring that same experience into Galaxy Defender for Hololens so a user with only a few minutes could play it or someone who had a much longer amount of time.
