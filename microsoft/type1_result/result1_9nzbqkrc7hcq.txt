name: Palmyra - Augmented Archaeology
description: Immerse in the ancient city of Palmyra, and experience the majestic archaeological monuments through your HoloLens.  Through the Syrian conflict, the magnificent archaeological monuments of Palmyra have been damaged or destroyed. The #NewPalmyra project is working to reconstruct this city's history in an online database of 3D models, where volunteers are using crowdsourced photos to help construct 3D models of Palmyra's monuments.  We are contributing our app, where we have imported 3D models of these monuments, for users to experience them in their full glory. Features: Map View - high level overview of historic sites in Palmyra Zooming - view the models at 1:1 or table-top scale levels Information - descriptions of each monument  Be sure to visit #NEWPALMYRA at http://www.newpalmyra.org/ to learn more about the initiative.
