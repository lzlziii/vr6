description: A Bird's peaceful summer slumber is disturbed by the majestic call of a mysterious Owl. Enticed to swallow the last piece of the waning Moon, Bird is blown far from its Golden Gate home.   Unscramble celestial puzzles and create miniature musical worlds. Re-awaken shadowy forests and bring life back to sparkling lakes. Discover hidden creatures, help the Bird reunite the fragmented Moon... and find its way home.   Brought to you by Funomena’s uniquely diverse team of veteran developers (Journey, Flower, Boom Blox, The Sims 2) Luna is an interactive fable about learning by the light of unexpected mistakes.   - Solve celestial puzzles to unlock each level's tree, plant and animal spirits. - Place, customize and interact with them in miniature, musical terrariums.  - Bring each world to life, revealing Austin Wintory’s haunting, enchanting score.
