name: Kibble Catch
description: This is a game where you need to feed the dog by looking at and clicking on each of the kibble that randomly appear in your space. At the same time, the food is eaten by the dog, so it's a race against time where if you're not quick enough, your dog will die. But don't worry, by saying the "Get Up" command you get to try again!
