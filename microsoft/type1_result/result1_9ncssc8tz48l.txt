name: Gravity Lab - Gravitational Testing Facility & Observations
description: Gravity Lab is a physics & electronics puzzle game with 22 levels and over 60 unique puzzles.  Build your incredible machine with gravity bending appliances from Gravity Lab! Our new lunar testing facility welcomes you to try out our standardised testing scenarios - now designed for humans!  No matter how fast or how heavy your objects are, Gravity Lab can move them! Save money and time by replacing your entire human workforce with automated appliances from Gravity Lab.  Currently awaiting regulatory approval, we invite you to visit our testing facility and give them a go! We have prepared a selection of test scenarios for you and we are certain you can solve them! Also, feel free to create your own test scenario and share them with fellow participants!   Please be aware that strong gravitational forces can cause severe brain damage! Never look directly at the emitted particles! While we tried our best to avoid the creation of micro wormholes, please never try to stack gravitational objects. All damages to the time and space continuum and involved repair cost will be passed on to you!   -- Gravity Lab Management
