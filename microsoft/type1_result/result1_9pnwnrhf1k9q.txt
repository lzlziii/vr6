name: Skypiercer VR Demo
description: Built for, and only for virtual-reality experiences, Skypiercer VR is a fast-paced racing game, which allows you to get a rough idea about what does soaring in the sky actually feels like.  Skypiercer VR is designed to be user-friendly. There aren't any complicated gears, confusing gauges and countless switches, all you have to do is looking at the next checkpoint, then go for it fearlessly.  However, Skypiercer VR will not always treat you as a baby. The simulation-style physics will also come as an option in the full-release version.  For the demo version, only 1 aircraft, 1 game mode and 3 levels are included. Free updates will be coming later.  (*WARNING*：For your own safety, please read the precautions in this software carefully.)
