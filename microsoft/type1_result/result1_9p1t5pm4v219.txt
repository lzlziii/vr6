description: Ever wondered where your Wi-Fi dead zones are? Trying to explain the concept of a "dead zone" to frustrated users who can't understand why the signal's no good in a particular part of the building? Now you can see your Wi-Fi coverage!  Simply air tap where you'd like to take a measurement, or say "measure". Walk around and see how your Wi-Fi coverage really looks.   Say "reset" to clear out old measurements and start again.
