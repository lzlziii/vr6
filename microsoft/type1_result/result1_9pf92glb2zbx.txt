name: HoloBlocks (FEVA)
description: Designed for long-term patients in children hospitals, HoloBlocks is made to relieve stress, anxiety, and boredom, and to encourage creativity and physical movement. Kids, teens, and adults of all ages and abilities have enjoyed HoloBlocks, so we hope you do too!  What's the objective? Be creative! HoloBlocks is an augmented reality block-building game, based on the blocks that we all played with as children (with easier cleanup!) The user can create, modify, and remove different types of blocks using simple voice commands. The user can also toggle gravity to make their virtual creations interact with the real world around them!  This game includes a tutorial for new users and a quick reference for returners who need a refresher. While HoloBlocks is single-player at this present time, we are working to develop a multiplayer version, so two or more users can build creations together!
