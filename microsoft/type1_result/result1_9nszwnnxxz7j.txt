description: Type is beautiful in HoloLens. With Type In Space, you can lay out and experience text in the real-world environment. With this new version for HoloLens 2, you can directly grab and interact with type. The new annotation feature allows you to annotate physical objects with a connected line. Snap to surface feature lets you lay out text on the physical surface with spatial mapping. You can control various properties of the type such as font, color, and outline. Since you can view the type from different angles, you can use this for designing architectural signage, book cover, or logotype. With the physics feature, you can make texts fall or fly.
