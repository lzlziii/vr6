name: Holo Measure
description: Holo Measure allows the user to set points with an air-tap to measure dimensions, areas and volumes. "Dimension" will place two points and close to the second point, it will indicate the exact dimension. "Area" works the same way, you can put a polygon of four points to calculate an area. "Volume" can be calculated by placing a polygon of four point and the fifth point is the height.  Voice command can also be used, by calling out the command to enable or disable. Other options: Is by clicking on the dimension text, which will change and set the units to imperial or metrics. "Drop all" will drop all the point, "Clear all" will delete all points also the dropped ones, "Map" will enable or disable the Spatial Mesh.  TIP: ✓ If you need more precision, go near the location and place your point. ✓ Also for more precision you can use the clicker instead of an air-tap. ✓ Quickly take a picture, call out to Cortana: "Hey Cortana Take a picture".  Keep posted, a lot of new features are planned for the next versions!
