description: Explore holographic mind mapping with Holo Mind Vector! Mind mapping is a very powerful and indispensable tool for brainstorming. From students in high school to top level managers in large scale corporations, mind mapping is used by almost everyone. Needless to say that harnessing the power of mind maps effectively can lead to increased productivity.  Holo Mind Vector adds another dimension to our popular Mind Vector app by augmenting 3D mind maps with the real world. You can move the maps around, scale them up and rotate them using the same gesture. Anyone can easily learn how to navigate their way around mind maps with just a few taps and manipulation gestures. Voice commands are also provided for almost all the functionality. Users can also drag individual nodes and place them wherever they like. Mind maps need not be boring as users can also view images and videos along with notes and links. There is also a magnify functionality which focuses on a group of nodes while the other nodes are blacked out.  The capability to view data in more dimensions can yield better results. Hololens allows for a richer, more immersive feeling than present forms of viewing mind maps while allowing the user to be aware of their environment. Brainstorming is essentially letting your ideas go wild. Adding an extra dimension to mind maps and ensuring that the user can interact with the maps in a deeper way allows for the mind to open up better. No longer are you confined to the bounds of a screen. You can interact with your ideas like you would with a real object. The medium affects the quality of the content indirectly. Hololens is the perfect medium to open up your mind. So go ahead and enjoy mind mapping with Holo Mind Vector!  Modes: Normal Mode - The map can be moved in this mode. Nodes can also be moved. Rotate Mode - The map can be rotated in this mode. Scale Mode - The map can be scaled up and down in this mode. Magnify Mode - A group of nodes can be viewed isolated from the rest of the map in this mode. This is not visible in the Control Panel.  Voice controls: Scale Map - Activates ‘Scale Mode’. Done - Activates ‘Normal Mode’. Rotate Map - Activates ‘Rotate Mode’. Reset Map - Resets changes made to the position, rotation and scale of the map. Map List - Switches to the map list screen. Previous - Switches to the previous page on the map list. Next - Switches to the next page on the map list. Jump to First - Jumps to the first page of the map.
