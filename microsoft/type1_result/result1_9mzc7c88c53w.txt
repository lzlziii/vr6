name: Tesseract with Instant 3D Builder
description: This program lets you explore the HyperCube operating in Four Dimensions and visualized in Three with a moving hologram.   The Instant 3D Builder engine with Perfect Word scripting lets you quickly build your own prototypes and share with others.  Please restart the program as needed especially just after first install or update.  Quick Start:  For HyperCube Help ... Say "show hypercube help" Say "add playspace" Say "draw hypercube" Say "bring to me" Experiment with the commands on the hypercube help screen.  For Instant 3D Builder help ...  Say "help" and allow the help screen to build to final beep.  Take some time to look over help. Say "stop rotation" if desired.   And you can say "bigger" or "smaller" as desired. Feel free to move around, or just say "bring to me".  Say "delete playspace".  Say "add playspace" Look away and say "bring to me"  Say "draw hypercube"   Say "help" again and allow the help screen to build to final beep. Look away to a convenient location and say "help" Say "smaller" Say "push left" to regain control of the playspace with the hypercube and store the current playspace.  Say "bring to me" to ensure you have control of the hypercube.  Now do your first script ... a script to draw three hypercubes and join into a single playspace that is easily manipulated.  Say "start script" and wait for the beep after the intro is spoken. Say "three hypercubes" ... the name Say "add playspace" ... adds a new playspace so the result of the script will be a new independent playspace  Say "add playspace" ... this will hold the first hypercube Say "draw hypercube" Say "join playspaces" ... joins to the first playspace  Say "add playspace"  Say "draw hypercube" Say "join playspaces" ... joins to the first playspace  Say "add playspace"  Say "draw hypercube" Say "join playspaces" ... joins to the first playspace  Say "remove axis" ... cleans up the axis added, one per playspace Say "remove axis" Say "remove axis" Say "remove axis"  Say "stop script" .. stops, processes, and makes available your script.  Now your new script is available to use, and will load up next time you start the program. To use it now, ...  Say "three hypercubes"  Look away and say "bring to me"  Say "slow rotate playspace on minus y"  Other hypercube commands are   "draw xy hypercube" "draw xw hypercube" ... and other commands using to letters from 'xyzw'. These are not yet on help.  Also "tesseract".  'Bloom' to suspend the program, or "application exit" to exit entirely.
