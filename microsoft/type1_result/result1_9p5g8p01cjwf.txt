name: Furnie
description: Furnie (beta) is the next generation tool for furniture planning and interior design. You can scan your apartment with a HoloLens, plan out your furniture placement in situ and get a birds eye view on 3D minimap. For best results, rooms should be empty during spatial mapping.  You can map and save an entire suite as one room scan, and then save your planned furniture arrangement. This lets you continue your furniture planning at a later time by loading the saved room and furniture arrangement. You can walk around and teleport in the virtual room. New: Use two-handed gestures to scale or rotate holographic furniture with dimension measurements.  Video demo of two-way mirroring of furniture placement between minimap and life-size: https://youtu.be/Y5YSZEdYlNY  You can switch between three sources of room scans: 1. live spatial mapping of current physical room; 2. loading a saved room from file; or 3. loading a sample room.
