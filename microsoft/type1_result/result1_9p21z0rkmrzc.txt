name: Digital Catalog
description: Digital Catalog (In hololens) is a Mixed Reality use case, which can be used to see interactive 3-D models, objects, and get an experiential feel with game type fun interactions. We have used this to show interactive working models of heavy equipment which is very hard to carry, setup and make it work anywhere. Digital catalogue is a custom Solution for any industry to display, interact, educate and train using mixed reality, from anywhere. And elevate factor specific services like location, skill, time etc. to the next level. This device not only recognizes it's surroundings and maps the virtual objects to the real surroundings (the Hololens recogonizes the floor, space and places the virtual object on it perfectly). The only limitation to the scope of this futuristic technology is your imagination. So imagine & experience with us …. Contact us for more VR Experiences at : contact@digitalmeridian.in
