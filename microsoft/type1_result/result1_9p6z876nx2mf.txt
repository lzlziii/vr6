description: Haro3D is an interface for the easy development of applications for the Hololens using LabVIEW from National Instruments and the Hololens. Haro3D is mainly aimed at scientists and engineers already familiarized with LabVIEW. Haro3D is an application running on the Hololens that communicates through the network with a LabVIEW application running on a separate computer.  The Haro3D Hololens app combined with the Haro3D library provides interactivity of Hololens users with a LabVIEW application through manipulations, voice commands, and menus; upload of LabVIEW 3D objects in the Hololens space, and real time display of front panels of LabVIEW VIs and controls. The Haro3D app also provides the ability, through LabVIEW, to share holograms between multiple Hololens using a common coordinate system. The Haro3D app running on the Hololens requires that the computer running LabVIEW has the Haro3D library version 2 installed. The Haro3D library version 2 requires LabVIEW 2016 or later, 32 or 64 bit version. LabVIEW must be installed before installing the Haro3D library. The Haro3D library can be installed for a 30-day free trial from National Instruments LabVIEW Tools Network (http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/213510), by simply using the link vipm://harotek_lib_haro3d, or by searching for Haro3D in the VIPM application from JKI.  See videos about the Haro3D library on HaroTek’s youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmxaabC-nkffasAzzlppyKw  Get information, ask questions, and see examples on National Instruments 3D Vision virtual group: https://forums.ni.com/t5/3D-Vision/gp-p/5002
