description: Charm Games brings you FORM, a surreal adventure that unfolds within the confines of the human mind.  Dr. Devin Eli is a brilliant physicist at the global technology mega-conglomerate Mindful Laboratories. Working in seclusion at an atmospheric research facility in the Alaskan wilderness, Dr. Eli is on the brink of uncovering the meaning behind a mysterious signal coming from a secret artifact - The Obelisk.  Playing as the gifted Dr. Eli, you have superhuman powers of geometric visualization - the unintended consequence of a childhood trauma. Use your powers to follow the signal through The Obelisk and explore dream-like memories to unlock puzzles in your own mind. This path could lead you to a new existence…or it could leave you trapped in your past forever.  “It’s immersive, engaging and beautiful, setting a new standard for virtual reality and visual design” 4/5 – Hardcore Gamer  “FORM shows a command of the medium that few have grasped with such clear intention” 8.5/10 – Road to VR  “Charm Games has created a mesmerizing experience from start to finish.” 4/5 – VRFocus
