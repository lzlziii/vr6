name: Holo Pool Hall
description: Holo Pool Hall is a simple pool table simulator for Hololens. Because Hololens is, with one unit, a very single user experience, this game is best enjoyed as a single player endeavor.  The game primarily uses voice commands for control. It is always assumed you want to hit the cue ball, so the line from your head to the cue ball is the direction you will shoot, and to execute a shot, you simply say "Shoot". You can also adjust your shot strength by saying before shooting: "Quarter Power", "Half Power", or "Full Power". Note that whatever power you set the simulation to, it will remain at that power until you set it to something else.  To rack 'em up fresh, just say "Reset World" at any time.  Saying "Move Table" enters table moving mode, and "Drop Table" to use the new position and continue your game. You can also adjust the rotation of the pool table if you find it is in an inconvenient orientation. The following voice commands facilitate that:  "Rotate Table Clockwise" "Rotate Table Counter Clockwise"  When you launch the game, the pool table will appear to be centered two meters straight ahead of you, and half a meter below your head.  More features are coming soon, as the experience is still in active development, so feel free to give suggestions, and stay tuned for updates.
