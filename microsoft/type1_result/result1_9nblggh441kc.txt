name: StereoScope
description: Delve into a photograph and see depth and perspective with a sharp clarity which makes you feel present in the scene, whether it’s a snap of life in the nineteenth century or a high flying skateboarder from the twenty first. New and old technology work together in this app, letting you enjoy stereoscopic images in a new light. Merging the charm and 3D vision of the traditional stereoscope with the power of the HoloLens, this app will allow you to experience a library of stereoscopic images as well as import and edit new additions, opening the world to your view.
