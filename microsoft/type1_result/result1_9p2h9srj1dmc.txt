name: Buggy Blasters
description: Play alone driving a remote-controlled buggy, or battle another player in the first online multiplayer game on HoloLens!  In this prototype you can control your squad of buggies to capture the enemy flag, but be sure to retreat in time to heal. Use that one muscular Air tap trained finger or an Xbox One S controller, whichever you prefer.  Employ crazy tactical skills, lightning speed and efficient buggy management to crush your opponent, who'll give you the 'sad Robocop' look.  Play the single player mode to lazily drive around in and practice target shooting.  Visit previewlabs.com/buggyblasters for more info.
