name: Therapy Lens
description: There is a large burden placed on the healthcare system to deal with the needs of patients suffering from neurological diseases. These patients require specific levels of support and rehabilitation that healthcare systems struggle to provide adequately. As of a result of the complexity of these systems and the dependency on them, patients suffer further losses in terms of quality of life and their personal independence. To address this issue, the Therapy Lens app idea was developed to enable patients to self-manage their health by completing ADL tasks at home or at a hospital with the Augmented Reality support and guidance.  This version serves as a DEMONSTRATION that includes some of the features for the application. These features were developed in order to measure the effect of supplementing existing rehabilitation methods, while ensuring that patients with these impairments may receive adequate support, both at home and in hospital.  Using the Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality device, users can perform activities of daily living (ADL) and tasks in real life while the application provides embedded virtual support that aims to guide users towards a successful outcome. The support takes the form of virtual objects and audio-visual feedback that appears within the user's field of view during the task. The current version includes the following features: 1) Orientation Games (Click, Gaze and Drag & Drop) to help the user get used to the basic interaction techniques with the HoloLens 2) Memory Game: The game is one of the most popular games, also known as Concentration, Match-Match or Pairs. Theoretically, the game focuses on enhancing the brain activity and increasing the attention and concentration. The game here is presented in the form of boxes. 3) Tea Making Scenario: This scenario represents a very common activity under the category of Activities of Daily Life (ADL). The scenario is an example scenario of the ADL tea making. The aim here to support users remember the different steps of preparing tea in the right order. This application is a demo version for a research project that was funded by the EIT Health. In its current version, the presented features demonstrates only basic functionalities of the whole idea. For this version, we do not claim or guarantee any positive impact on users’ health.
