name: Hololens Insurance
description: This game is a project from HackZurich 2016, developed for the Microsoft Hololens. It's a prototype for Axa insurances and Microsoft.  Play around in a room full of things that can burn, get drenched and have fun with the Microsoft octopus. Try out what different insurances of Axa would have reimbursed (as we all know, you set the couch on fire by accident only). Try to maximize the destroyed or reimbursed value in 1 minutes of crazy playtime.
