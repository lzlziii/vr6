description: Paint Arena: The first ever Windows Mixed Reality app that lets people of all ages paint in 3D or play paintball in a shared social experience with voice chat, on both HoloLens and Immersive headsets from all over the world. NEW: AI Robot "Pablo" will walk you through the basics.   Teleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess.   Feeling energy for action? Try our multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!  Follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)  Conceptualization:  Many virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.   Instructions: You will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.  This social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap "Reset Floor Level".   You could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer.   Toggle "Painting On" to "Paint Balling" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing "Refill 20 Paintballs" button or saying the voice command "Refill Paint Ball". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds.   In Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While "Painting On", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While "Paint Balling", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.  Once you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap "Pick Color" to bring up the large color wheel.   If you made a mistake, you can say "Erase Last Stroke" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying "Erase All Strokes".   To rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers.   To teleport, make sure the panel shows "Teleport On". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick.   In HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While "Painting On", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While "Paint Balling", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.  Before teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows "Teleport On". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes. Remember to turn off teleport before drawing or shooting.
