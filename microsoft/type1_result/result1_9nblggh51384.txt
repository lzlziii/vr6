name: HoloFlight (beta)
description: Try HoloFlight and use HoloLens’ groundbreaking technology to visualize real flight data in 3D as holograms.   The user can walk around and explore various parts of the visualized flight space. Simply gaze at airplanes to see detailed flight information or even hear ATC conversations with spatial sound. Different zoom levels of the terrain allow the user to see a broader view but also detailed information for a specific airport, including the control tower’s point of view.  An introductory tutorial will guide the user through the interactions once the experience is launched. The tutorial can also be opened again at any time by saying "Show Tutorial". You can also watch a video : https://vimeo.com/202999079  This is a demo version of HoloFlight using offline data. You can choose between Hawai'i and the French Riviera flight space region. HoloFlight is in beta and improvements will follow.
