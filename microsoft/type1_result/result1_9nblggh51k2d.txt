name: The Floor is Lava
description: For most of us, the scenario is all too familiar: You’re in the comfort of your home, when suddenly hot molten rock begins to flow through the living room. In this situation, what else can one do besides climb between safe points and collect floating ice cream treats?  Thankfully, the geniuses over at HoloFriends have created your one-stop training simulator to prepare you for just such an emergency. So, strap on your favorite HoloLens headset and let Mr. Diki guide you through some action-packed, ice-cream eating, lava-avoiding mayhem.
