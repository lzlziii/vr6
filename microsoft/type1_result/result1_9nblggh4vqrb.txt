name: Galaxy Shield - BETA
description: !!! IN BETA !!!  Description: You are the last resort to keep your galaxy safe from waves of incoming evil mechanical machines summoned by your galactic neighbor.  Beta Details: This is a gameplay example for defending one of the many planets within your galaxy. Currently there is only one enemy type and you are locked to the first level of each tower type. The currency system for defeating enemies and building towers is disabled so you can play with building all the different tower types in different configurations.  Once you have completed the level successfully or the planet has been overrun by your foes the level will reload.  Testing the Beta: Since there is no placing mechanism implemented currently you will want to find an empty 8x8 foot space. Then you will want to stand about 4 feet away from the center of that space and look towards the center of the space and launch the application. This will give you room to move around the planet.  Gaze at the planet and tap/drag to rotate the planet. Hand movement work like a joystick. The closer to the edge you are the faster the planet will rotate.  Gaze at a tower platform and tap to open the menu to build towers.  To start the wave of enemies (after you have built a few towers) tap to select the blue glowing shield on the planet and the round will start.
