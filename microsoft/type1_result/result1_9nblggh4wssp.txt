name: Ball Pit
description: Learn Gaze and Gestures while experiencing Spatial Mapping and Spatial Sound. Ball Pit is a fun and easy way to learn about the HoloLens.  Ball Pit is a simple physics simulation of plastic balls that interact with your environment. Use Gaze and Air tap to move the source of the balls wherever you like. While holding the Ready Gesture you can push the balls around with your cursor, or you can just walk in to the pile.  Ball Pit is a great introduction to HoloLens for non-technical users or as a quick demonstration. The game is intentionally simple to make it easy to explain to a first time user without seeing what they see. No menu navigation or room mapping required.   Have fun!
