description: Valorem Reply’s innovative 3D telepresence technology, HoloBeam, is breaking down geographic barriers to teamwork and communication and leading the way in remote, volumetric telepresence and collaboration. This ground-breaking technology allows HoloLens users to communicate in real-time with holographic likenesses of colleagues from anywhere in the world. Using 3D depth, motion and full color volumetric video, Valorem Reply’s HoloBeam app streams point cloud data across the Internet using a customized WebRTC stream and normal internet connection (5Mbit/sec). The holographic stream is then decoded and rendered via Microsoft HoloLens, to show a holographic representation of the sender.    HoloBeam is in early access alpha state with pilot deployment opportunities for interested clients. However, the technology currently enables: real-time or on-demand options and full functionality with normal internet connections and within strict firewalls over secure channels.  Ongoing developments include new collaboration tools that allow team members to have shared interactions with 3D applications in the HoloBeam collaboration space.   Please enjoy this tech demo app which demonstrates the HoloBeam technology and allows you to experience the functionality with your own eyes using pre-recorded data. To view the voice commands supported by the demo app, say "show help".
