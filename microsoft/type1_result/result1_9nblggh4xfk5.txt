name: Visual Translator
description: Visual Translator allows you to translate textual information in your field of view from and to a variety of languages (see release notes for full list of supported languages). By looking straight into a billboard, sign, food menu, magazine or any other media with text written on it, and air tapping a couple of times, you are able to see a translated version of the words right on your screen! Visual Translator is specially useful during travels to foreign countries where you don't read the local language.  How to use Visual Translator:  For best results, position yourself straight in front of the billboard, sign, magazine, or text canvas that you wish to translate and align the text to the two horizontal lines so that the words are between them. Make sure the size of the letters are about as big as the space between the lines. After you have aligned the text to the two lines, air tap once to begin translation.   Translation quality decreases dramatically if you don't follow these instructions. For more information on how to obtain best translation results visit www.refractiontech.com.
