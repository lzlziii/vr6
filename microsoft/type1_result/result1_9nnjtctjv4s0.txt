description: The MiaBella 3D Scatter Plot & Regression (demo version) is now available in 3D holographic form for the Microsoft HoloLens.  This is a powerful tool to represent and explore data in three dimensions.  The core chart is an interactive holographic 3D scatter plot visualization. You can also perform a linear multiple regression on your data with basic regression output, graphical regression plane, and confidence intervals.  Voice Commands  This HoloLens app takes instructions from your hand movements, your head position, your voice, your keyboard, and even your mouse. For a list of HoloLens voice commands, see: http://www.miabellaai.net/3dViz/holographic/  Most important are the “Click” and “Tap” voice commands, which are like a mouse click. Both of these voice instructions select the highlighted area you have targeted with your viewing direction.  Display  The MiaBella 3D Scatter Plot & Regression opens showing multiple control panels that rotate into the background to allow more visible space for the display of your data. Simply move your gaze over any of the controls to bring them forward. Move your viewing spot away from a selected panel to push it into the background.  The left panel offers a variety of statistical and visual controls through a graphical user interface controlled by your viewing direction. There are also many other settings described on the Commands page at the MiaBella web site.  The bottom right control panel is how you choose the data you want to display. There are five sample data sets that you can use to explore this program’s features.  Multiple Linear Regression  If you choose to run a regression analysis on your data, the results will appear in the top-right panel. This frame displays most of the information that business people examine when using a regression model.
