description: BIM Holoview is a tool designed for architects, engineers, construction teams and facility managers to overlay 3D Revit models on real buildings using Microsoft HoloLens. During construction it can be used to visualize BIM models in an actual build environment, plan the sequencing of construction and fit-outs, and identify anomalies between the plans and actual building. In a completed building it gives facility managers ‘x-ray vision’ through walls, floors and ceilings to see structural elements and locate building services for maintenance.  Users can sign up at www.bimholoview.com for an account to use the software.
