name: Panoptica Lite
description: Panoptica Lite is a demo version of our full application, Panoptica - AR Collaboration Suite. Panoptica is an Augmented Realty (AR) application that loads 3D models from your desktop and renders them in AR. While using the app, the model can be displayed to scale allowing for the user to interact with and manipulate the model in real-time. These interactions speed up design review conversations and make collaborations about operations, ergonomics, safety, and maintenance in a manner that is simpler, more effective, and much more cost efficient than today's current methods.  Panoptica Lite features include:  -View the models in their actual size or scale them up/down -Place and rotate models -Measure distances between elements of models -Access pop-up tooltips with information about various components in models  Our full version also offers the ability to:  -Load models to the Microsoft Hololens and other supported AR devices from a desktop application -Interact with the models and collaborate with multiple people in the same virtual space at the same time, regardless of whether they’re in the same room or not -Avatar Projections - Have avatars represent remote users and highlight what they are looking at for easy collaboration -Compare as-built to plan by overlaying optically scanned versions of constructed objects on top of the planned 3D models
