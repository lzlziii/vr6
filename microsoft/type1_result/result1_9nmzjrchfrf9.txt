name: Knock of the Dead
description: The dead have risen. Civilization has collapsed. Your own home, compromised. Or is it?  Knock of the Dead is a HoloLens survival horror game where you barricade and defend your home from the hordes of the undead. Define entry points to your location using an intuitive two-point doorway designation system and block entrance to your room with increasingly stronger barricades. Collect salvage by smashing crates and upgrade your defenses. Increase your chances to find salvage on your next supply run by collecting newspaper clippings taped on your walls. Fight off the invading horde at night with up to four blunt force weapons. Swing at your attackers with a shovel, slash them with a kitchen knife, or rely on your trusty hammer to keep their zombie hands off your defenses! How well is your home prepared for the zombie apocalypse? How long can you survive?  Features: * Survival horror on the HoloLens! * Quick to pick up and play: Easy to learn, one-gesture interface system. * Easy entry point designation: Tap on the top left and bottom right corners of your door frame to specify where the zombies can enter your home.  * Spatial surround sound: Locate the nearest danger zone which may be behind you! * 4 different melee weapons to fight off the invading horde. * Three barricade types to hold out against the dead. * Secure your home with barbed wire to set up last-resort barricades using your entangled enemies! * Increasing difficulty as you progress: As the days pass, more zombies will swarm your defenses while your supplies get more scarce!  Made with Unity. To get the most out of this experience, it is recommended that you designate 1-3 entry points corresponding to real, closed door locations. This game involves movement.
