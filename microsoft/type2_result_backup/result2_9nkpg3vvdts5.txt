description: Strap on the headset and enter a research lab at the edge of the mountains, in all its wild glory. This unit is about robots, robotics and with a little biodiversity thrown in. So what’s cool? Students will learn to program robots in the interactive Robolympiad. Enter instructions and see the path - ordered or crazy - your robot takes.  Our field trip visits one of the top high school robotics team in the country as they build their robot and prepare for competition. In fact, we get into the cage with the robot as it takes it’s commands from the students and experience the robot up close.  Sometimes humans get a little help from machines. Wendy Martin is our national runner-up teacher of the year and she explores the concept of prosthetics: artificial limbs and human parts.   Then you will enter the liquid surround display as we learn the science behind helmets, why and how they protect our heads. Forces and physics are a key part of this 360 surround experience.   As always, VictoryVR learning is fun, immersive and amazing. At the same time, our curriculum specialist is meticulous about making sure each lesson is tied to a national science standard as created through the Next Gen Science Standards.   We have 48 units covering every area of middle and high school science. If you plan to learn science, might as well do it in virtual reality.
