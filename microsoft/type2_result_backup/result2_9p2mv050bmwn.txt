description: Experience Your Creations: Experience your 3D Assets in a Windows Mixed Reality Environment. Digital Portal Viewer allows you to see your 3D work like never before as you walk around, within or through anything you want.  No Limits: Digital Portal Viewer enables you to load any '.obj', '.fbx', '.dae' & '.3ds' file type into the viewing platform to experience first hand. This could be something from a simple box to an entre city. As long as it is the right file type the App can handle it.  Show the World: We wanted you to be in control of what content gets loaded into the App. Whether you are showing your friend a T-Rex or a Customer a Kitchen Design you can select what objects get loaded in by simply opening the file from the File Explorer.  Manipulate your assets: Intuitive controls allow you to manipulate the objects with the Motion Controllers so if something isn't quite right it is simple enough to put right with rotate, scale and translate at your figure tips. Simply hold down the trigger to enter the edit mode.
