description: Warning: App may cause motion sickness.  You say you’re learning about engineering design? Well, put on the headset and join us in China as you stand on the Great Wall of China and see how The Great Wall winds its way through the mountains of China. Even more, learn how the invading Mongols from the north caused China to undertake this engineering marvel.   This unit - Masters of Design - is set in a mountain-based research facility which takes you on an amazing journey through design and engineering.   Our Manga comic book in a dark virtual reality room, takes you through the discoveries of Thomas Edison as he learned to harness electricity. While you’re in the room, be sure to set the vintage radio to your favorite classical station.   Fly among the clouds in our learning game as you take off and soar through the skies. When presented with questions, just lean in and dive or rise toward the correct answer. This game is fast-paced and an adrenaline rush.   Ever stood in the middle of a winter snow storm? Wendy the Science Teacher takes us out into the snow as she explains the science of making snow.   You will also enjoy a visually engaging story about solar cars. The engineering challenges of solar powered cars gives us a fascinating under the hood look at how they work and the impact they might have on our future.
