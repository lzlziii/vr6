name: Take Flight
description: Warning: App may cause motion sickness  Zoom through the sky with a birds-eye view as you fly in the cradle of our drone! While soaring hundreds of feet in the air, learn about the pros & cons of this increasingly prevalent technology.  Hang out in the airplane hangar with full 360* view of the Wright Flyer. Take in the various angles of this flying machine and see how Orville and Wilbur mastered the feat of air flight. You can even take it for a spin yourself.  Probe the habits of Asian Elephants as you learn more about modern technologies, including satellite intervention into keeping a close eye on this breed and others.   3-2-1--blast off into outer space with the SpaceX Program. Catch up on their recent attempts and improvements in air travel to the outer world--you just might be a passenger one day.  Ever fly a plane in poor weather conditions? Find out how pilots navigate airplanes through ice, wind, snow, and other hazardous conditions in this one-of-a-kind weather-simulated environment for testing.  As always, VictoryVR curriculum is stimulating and fun! Better yet, it’s rooted in the Next Gen Science Standards so it is directly linked with science teachings in today’s classrooms.
