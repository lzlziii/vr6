name: Wright And Ferris: Up, Up and Away
description: Dip, flip, and glide...Trace the Wright Brothers’ path on their quest for flight! See how they employed “delimiting” to continually improve their flying apparatus.  Beat the troll at each door of this interactive escape castle to win your freedom. Accurately answering questions based on unit content will vaporize these pesky guards who block your path to the outside.  Go with the flow as you follow the “flow chart” of the design process when constructing anything. The teachings here will help you in all future project construction--guaranteed!  Ever make a paper airplane? Check out these different attempts and simple constructions as you learn how engineering practices can lead to the ultimate paper plane.  Hold on to your hats and if you dare, accompany renowned teacher, Wendy Martin, as she takes a ride in a Ferris Wheel. Find out how the invention came to be in a competition contest for the mega-builders of the time.  As always, VictoryVR curriculum is stimulating and fun! Better yet, it’s rooted in the Next Gen Science Standards so it is directly linked with science teachings in today’s classrooms.
