description: Sound Sphere provides a new experience.  Please select one object floating in the space and fire it toward the wall of the sphere. When it hits the wall it is colored and the sound begins to ring.   The sound gets bigger when approaching, and it gets smaller as you go further away. When you fire objects one after another, a lot of sounds overlap and the music spreads throughout the space. Please make only you music.
