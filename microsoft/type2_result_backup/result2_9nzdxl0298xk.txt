description: ANIMA RES, a highly specialised production company for medical visualisation, has committed itself to awaken our fascination for the human body.  INSIGHT HEART VR is the first app from a planned series for the medical education of the future. Within INSIGHT HEART VR a virtual companion called „ANI“ guides you through the functions of the application. Incredibly impressive visuals of myocardial infarction, arterial hypertension and atrial fibrillation enrich the experience and take medical education to the next level.  You are able to control the heart by voice or controllers. Move, rotate and scale the high-resolution heart floating right in front of you. Experience the heartbeat in real time in a fascinating and immersive way.  View the heart from the inside, or learn about the different regions in the annotations view. The freeze and unfreeze function lets you examine the heart from every angle with no further distractions.  INSIGHT HEART VR makes medical education fun again! Enjoy! :)
