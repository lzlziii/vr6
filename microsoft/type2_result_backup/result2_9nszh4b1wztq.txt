name: DNA: Crack the Code
description: Visit this high-tech farm with mechanized milking devices as you stand amid the beefy Jersey cows. Learn how modern agriculture practices, using GMOs and cross-breeding can yield dozens of different apple types too.  Beat the troll at each door of this interactive escape castle to win your freedom. Accurately answering questions based on unit content will vaporize these pesky guards who block your path to the outside.  Meet Rosalind Franklin and know how her work helps us know more about our bodies genetic construction. Learn about her part in the discovery of double helix DNA in the world’s first virtual comic book.  Map out how humans are constructed in the piece about biological blueprints. From the genetic code to the pesky mutations that often create oddities, gain a better understanding of how we work from the inside.  Visit the local blood drive in progress while learning about the pros and cons of gene therapy, as well as other genetic information contained in our ever-pumping bloodstream.  As always, VictoryVR curriculum is stimulating and fun! Better yet, it’s rooted in the Next Gen Science Standards so it is directly linked with science teachings in today’s classrooms.
