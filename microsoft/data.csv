Open files saved in the cloud using a file picker, actively find patterns in your data by changing the dimensions to be displayed and get a better understanding by gazing at data objects and receiving additional info.  This app specifically works well with multidimensional data containing both categorical and numerical dimensions.   Note: The app can only display a maximum of 50 groups/bars at a time. Anything above that will not be displayed.   A few things about data formatting: Missing data values should be left empty. The following file formats are accepted: - CSV (up to 5 MB in size): The file needs to use commas as separators. Do not use an index. The first line defines the column names and hence needs to consist of strings. - JSON (up to 8 MB in size): the file needs to be formatted as follows: one key/value pair per data column/dimension containing the column name as the key and an array of data as the value. All dimensions/columns need to have the same length and the values need to be of the same type.  The file you want to open needs to be uploaded into the location that your file picker accesses. When using OneDrive as a file picker, your files need to be saved in your OneDrive folder.  For a detailed user manual including sample files, please visit the website linked below."

Almost all of the known visual illusions are evoked by using a two-dimensional (2D) presentation. Take as example the ""Freezing Rotation Illusion"". Here a physically continuously turning foreground object (e.g. an image of an airplane) is perceived as slowing down (freezing) and speeding up, while its surround (e.g. the image of a greenhouse) is rotating back and forth.  When using a 3-dimensional turning airplane model with different back and forth rotating surroundings, which are the best conditions for the Freezing Rotation Illusion to occur?  Firstly, which is the optimal surround? Wedges in randomly chosen sizes and colors or are combined to build a tubular and/or a disk shaped surround. Another choice is a 360° x 180° panorama of a green-house. Secondly, should the airplane and its surround be in about the same depth plane, i.e. in about the same distance from the observer or not? Thirdly, how much the airplane and its surrounding have to overlap for the illusion still to arise? Can we look from the side and still get the illusion?"

Joshua Norton proclaimed himself ""Norton I, Emperor of the United States"", in the Evening Bulletin newspaper on September 17, 1859.   He was a famous fixture in the town, one who had his ear to the ground on the social and political issues of the day. A good number of the Emperor's thoughts were published as proclamations in the newspapers and amongst these, the pursuit of connecting San Francisco and Oakland by bridge.   Long after the death of Emperor Norton and more than 60 years later, construction began on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and it opened to traffic in 1936. Fast-forward to today, and there is a magnificent art installation on that same bridge.   You will hear some of his story over five vignettes, the last one giving you the opportunity to play on (and with) The Emperor Norton Bridge.  This app contains life-size holograms and is best used in a large open room with lots of light."

Because Hololens is, with one unit, a very single user experience, this game is best enjoyed as a single player endeavor.  The game primarily uses voice commands for control. It is always assumed you want to hit the cue ball, so the line from your head to the cue ball is the direction you will shoot, and to execute a shot, you simply say ""Shoot"". You can also adjust your shot strength by saying before shooting: ""Quarter Power"", ""Half Power"", or ""Full Power"". Note that whatever power you set the simulation to, it will remain at that power until you set it to something else.  To rack 'em up fresh, just say ""Reset World"" at any time.  Saying ""Move Table"" enters table moving mode, and ""Drop Table"" to use the new position and continue your game. You can also adjust the rotation of the pool table if you find it is in an inconvenient orientation. The following voice commands facilitate that:  ""Rotate Table Clockwise"" ""Rotate Table Counter Clockwise""  When you launch the game, the pool table will appear to be centered two meters straight ahead of you, and half a meter below your head.  More features are coming soon, as the experience is still in active development, so feel free to give suggestions, and stay tuned for updates."

See https://iform.us. Loci is a method of loci mixed reality mind mapping application located around you. It combines the method of loci memory technique and 3D mixed reality interaction with mind maps (graphs) to support you on your personal analysis tasks. These tasks can include looking for an apartment, finding out more about a disease, or deciding on a next job. Loci features initial import capability for MindManager, Freemind, and GraphML files.   Why - Loci uses three core concepts to help you organize, understand and recall; mind maps lets you break a problem down into component parts to organize and do analysis, mixed reality interaction with mind maps lets you visualize in 3D to understand how they are related, and the method of loci persistent placement of mind map nodes lets you improve your recall of the mind map, even when you are not using the Loci software. In this way you can organize your problem, understand it, and remember it later when you need to use that information for decisions.  How - Loci is built for Windows Mixed Reality. Loci supports spatial mapping so you can place nodes from your mind maps in relevant locations in your memory palace. Loci uses voice, gaze and gestures to enable you to make your 3D graphs (mind maps). You start by saying ""add node"" to make a node representing the problem you are working on, then you look at this node and again say ""add node"" to add more nodes for attributes of the problem, so you have a visualization of your problem. You can say ""capture image"" to add nodes with images using the camera, or say ""load image"" add nodes with images from files. You can link nodes together to show how they are related to each other. To load and save mind maps you use File Explorer or OneDrive. To help you understand how Loci works, it has a seven day free trial.  Where - Where you place and do things is very important to your memory. Locations in your memory palace are important to you. They have meaning that you effectively recall, and with Loci you can combine your visual and spatial memory.  When - Loci helps you on longer term problems you are working on, where you need to apply your capabilities for cognition. You may return to these problems over a span of weeks or months to arrive at the right decision. You use Loci when you have set aside time to do deep analysis at home or work.  Who - If you are solving complex problems, produce complex things, or purchasing complex items or services, such as cars, houses, college, stocks, or medical treatment, you could benefit by organizing, understanding, and recalling your information using Loci."

IN BETA !!!  Description: You are the last resort to keep your galaxy safe from waves of incoming evil mechanical machines summoned by your galactic neighbor.  Beta Details: This is a gameplay example for defending one of the many planets within your galaxy. Currently there is only one enemy type and you are locked to the first level of each tower type. The currency system for defeating enemies and building towers is disabled so you can play with building all the different tower types in different configurations.  Once you have completed the level successfully or the planet has been overrun by your foes the level will reload.  Testing the Beta: Since there is no placing mechanism implemented currently you will want to find an empty 8x8 foot space. Then you will want to stand about 4 feet away from the center of that space and look towards the center of the space and launch the application. This will give you room to move around the planet.  Gaze at the planet and tap/drag to rotate the planet. Hand movement work like a joystick. The closer to the edge you are the faster the planet will rotate.  Gaze at a tower platform and tap to open the menu to build towers.  To start the wave of enemies (after you have built a few towers) tap to select the blue glowing shield on the planet and the round will start.

Visual Translator is specially useful during travels to foreign countries where you don't read the local language.  How to use Visual Translator:  For best results, position yourself straight in front of the billboard, sign, magazine, or text canvas that you wish to translate and align the text to the two horizontal lines so that the words are between them. Make sure the size of the letters are about as big as the space between the lines. After you have aligned the text to the two lines, air tap once to begin translation.

This ground-breaking technology allows HoloLens users to communicate in real-time with holographic likenesses of colleagues from anywhere in the world. Using 3D depth, motion and full color volumetric video, Valorem Reply’s HoloBeam app streams point cloud data across the Internet using a customized WebRTC stream and normal internet connection (5Mbit/sec). The holographic stream is then decoded and rendered via Microsoft HoloLens, to show a holographic representation of the sender.    HoloBeam is in early access alpha state with pilot deployment opportunities for interested clients. However, the technology currently enables: real-time or on-demand options and full functionality with normal internet connections and within strict firewalls over secure channels.  Ongoing developments include new collaboration tools that allow team members to have shared interactions with 3D applications in the HoloBeam collaboration space.   Please enjoy this tech demo app which demonstrates the HoloBeam technology and allows you to experience the functionality with your own eyes using pre-recorded data. To view the voice commands supported by the demo app, say ""show help""."

NEW: AI Robot ""Pablo"" will walk you through the basics.   Teleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess.   Feeling energy for action? Try our multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!  Follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)  Conceptualization:  Many virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.   Instructions: You will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.  This social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap ""Reset Floor Level"".   You could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer.   Toggle ""Painting On"" to ""Paint Balling"" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing ""Refill 20 Paintballs"" button or saying the voice command ""Refill Paint Ball"". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds.   In Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While ""Painting On"", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While ""Paint Balling"", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.  Once you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap ""Pick Color"" to bring up the large color wheel.   If you made a mistake, you can say ""Erase Last Stroke"" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying ""Erase All Strokes"".   To rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers.   To teleport, make sure the panel shows ""Teleport On"". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick.   In HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While ""Painting On"", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While ""Paint Balling"", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.  Before teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows ""Teleport On"". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes. Remember to turn off teleport before drawing or shooting."

Air tapping on a component will reveal the information both in text and sound. User can hide or remove any component such as wall and roof to reveal the contents inside the house. Cortana voice commands to remove a component are “remove” followed by the name of the component such as “roof”, “rafters”, walls”, “windows”, “first floor”, “joists”, “ground floor”, “foundation” and “terrain”. All the components that were hidden can be brought back using the voice command “restore”. User can also visualize the model in real life scale. The Cortana voice command is “go there”. While the cursor is pointing at a spot in the living room area of the scaled model for example, uttering the voice command “go there” will resize the model to full scale with the user standing at the location of the cursor. User can walk around to examine the real-life scale model of surrounding objects. User can navigate to first floor by pointing the cursor at a spot at first floor and use the same voice command “go there”. Finally, the model can be returned to its original model scale and position by using the voice command “zoom out”.

This provides users a more immersive experience and conveniently relays spatial information before transactions, without the need for premature shipment, assembly, or furniture movement/placement; ultimately reducing the rate of returns/exchanges.  The motivation behind the project is based on the fact that Ikea, the world's largest furniture retailer, maintains multiple commerce channels for consumers in print, online, and in stores with ¬200 million printed catalogues, >700 million store visits, and >2 billion visits to ikea.com, the largest of the three. Hence, e-commerce, yields a returns rate of 10 percent, three times higher than that of transactions made at brick-and-mortar stores. This difference is attributed to the consumer being less informed about the product at the time of purchase when shopping for furniture online, leading to dissatisfaction with the size, aesthetics, or decorum compatibility with the furniture post-transaction.  Before releasing, extensive user studies were conducted to measure usability. The user's interactions in selecting, moving, and pinning the holographic 3D models while wearing the HoloLens headset was observed to determine the efficacy of the software. The software's ability to assist the consumer in assessing furniture, versus looking at static images and text was measured. The ease of use and perusal time for users interacting with the software was also measured to evaluate likelihood of adoption.  Please help provide feedback to improve future versions of the app. Any constructive feedback is encouraged and welcome.

Save the Earth, burn the Sun.  To pay off your life debts you’ve been uploaded to one of millions of nano-workbots in the Sun’s core to prevent solar flares by breaking down neon isotopes.  You control an ion cannon in a 360º gravitationally affected environment, firing positive and negative ions using left & right triggers at incoming neon isotopes of varying ‘charge’ to eliminate them.    Neon uses a modern day reboot of the classic retro arcade style. Featuring vector polygonal lines and surfaces illuminated by pulsating neon lighting with immersive 360º action.  Each of the 42 levels of the game have been carefully crafted with each formation requiring a different strategy to achieve best times. There’s a solid sense of progression and a steady ramping up of difficulty - ideal for introducing non-gamers to VR but challenging enough for more experienced players.   Levels develop to include stronger gravitational forces, more isotopes, and new kinds of jeopardy. Boss levels with super-structures need new strategies, with a selection of power-ups such as slo-mo, shockwave and solar blossom mode adding to the fun. Your sassy AI sidekick Seren has always got something to say - but is mostly just sarcastic.  Utilising the talents of three music producers (Forward Memory, Dynamix, and I Am Galactic), Neon features an original soundtrack of ambient electronica, synthwave and electro which complements the modern-retro styling of the game.   “It’s like Tron had sex with an atom” - some guy on Reddit"

Mind mapping is a very powerful and indispensable tool for brainstorming. From students in high school to top level managers in large scale corporations, mind mapping is used by almost everyone. Needless to say that harnessing the power of mind maps effectively can lead to increased productivity.  Holo Mind Vector adds another dimension to our popular Mind Vector app by augmenting 3D mind maps with the real world. You can move the maps around, scale them up and rotate them using the same gesture. Anyone can easily learn how to navigate their way around mind maps with just a few taps and manipulation gestures. Voice commands are also provided for almost all the functionality. Users can also drag individual nodes and place them wherever they like. Mind maps need not be boring as users can also view images and videos along with notes and links. There is also a magnify functionality which focuses on a group of nodes while the other nodes are blacked out.  The capability to view data in more dimensions can yield better results. Hololens allows for a richer, more immersive feeling than present forms of viewing mind maps while allowing the user to be aware of their environment. Brainstorming is essentially letting your ideas go wild. Adding an extra dimension to mind maps and ensuring that the user can interact with the maps in a deeper way allows for the mind to open up better. No longer are you confined to the bounds of a screen. You can interact with your ideas like you would with a real object. The medium affects the quality of the content indirectly. Hololens is the perfect medium to open up your mind. So go ahead and enjoy mind mapping with Holo Mind Vector!  Modes: Normal Mode - The map can be moved in this mode. Nodes can also be moved. Rotate Mode - The map can be rotated in this mode. Scale Mode - The map can be scaled up and down in this mode. Magnify Mode - A group of nodes can be viewed isolated from the rest of the map in this mode. This is not visible in the Control Panel.  Voice controls: Scale Map - Activates ‘Scale Mode’.

Thereby, issues on physical installations can be assessed audio-visually as well as holographically. All users can not only interact with the MR user’s environment but can also share and manipulate all kinds of supporting materials for the most efficient problem-solving process.  Augmented collaboration Our augmented collaboration functionality allows HoloLens users to collaborate with colleagues working on MR devices within a shared location and remotely, while remote users are visualized as avatars. Thereby, the immersive experience is shared among a session’s attendees while all interactions with the holographic content - documents, pictures, audio files, videos or 3D models (in tabletop- or overlay-mode) are synchronized in real-time.  Workflow support Our workflow support functionality allows HoloLens users to be guided through complex workflows by means of holographic, location-based step-by-step instructions. Thereby, the workflows can be prepared in a highly efficient manner using our web-based management portal – requesting for various kinds of user inputs and attaching supporting materials (e.g. documents, pictures, audio files, videos, 3D models) for individual steps. Condition-based consecutive steps are also supported (i.e. branching) leading to an intelligent workflow execution process.

These patients require specific levels of support and rehabilitation that healthcare systems struggle to provide adequately. As of a result of the complexity of these systems and the dependency on them, patients suffer further losses in terms of quality of life and their personal independence. To address this issue, the Therapy Lens app idea was developed to enable patients to self-manage their health by completing ADL tasks at home or at a hospital with the Augmented Reality support and guidance.  This version serves as a DEMONSTRATION that includes some of the features for the application. These features were developed in order to measure the effect of supplementing existing rehabilitation methods, while ensuring that patients with these impairments may receive adequate support, both at home and in hospital.  Using the Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality device, users can perform activities of daily living (ADL) and tasks in real life while the application provides embedded virtual support that aims to guide users towards a successful outcome. The support takes the form of virtual objects and audio-visual feedback that appears within the user's field of view during the task. The current version includes the following features: 1) Orientation Games (Click, Gaze and Drag & Drop) to help the user get used to the basic interaction techniques with the HoloLens 2) Memory Game: The game is one of the most popular games, also known as Concentration, Match-Match or Pairs. Theoretically, the game focuses on enhancing the brain activity and increasing the attention and concentration. The game here is presented in the form of boxes. 3) Tea Making Scenario: This scenario represents a very common activity under the category of Activities of Daily Life (ADL). The scenario is an example scenario of the ADL tea making. The aim here to support users remember the different steps of preparing tea in the right order. This application is a demo version for a research project that was funded by the EIT Health. In its current version, the presented features demonstrates only basic functionalities of the whole idea. For this version, we do not claim or guarantee any positive impact on users’ health.

Each piece of equipment and process area at your facility has lots of data and resources associated with it that your staff needs to do their jobs. The problem is, these resources are scattered across in many different applications, and aren’t easily available where you need them most: standing right in front of the equipment. iQagent changes that.   iQagent allows you to create Points Of Interest, or POIs, to link a physical piece of equipment, asset or process space to its relevant data and resource from your existing plant systems, such as SCADA, HMI, Database, Microsoft SharePoint or other Electronic Document systems, CMMS, MES, ERP and others. iQagent POIs can include real time data from your PLC, SCADA or production databases, schematics, documents, videos, forms and other resources. Create POIs for all of your automation equipment, production lines, and process spaces. When workers are repairing, monitoring or maintaining equipment, they interact with the POI to get the information they need to do their job. All of the information you need is right where you want it, and You are ""Hands Free"" to do whatever work needs to be done.  How it works  The app can be used in either a demo mode (Internal Mode) or in conjunction with a “Live” mode system using the iQagent Server and Configuration tool installed in your plant.   Internal Mode allows you to learn how the app functions and to experience how you can view the data and documentation of a typical plant floor using Mixed Reality.  In Live Mode, You will create and configure your very own Points of Interest that include live process data (via OPCDA, OPCUA and ODBC) and schematics, forms, videos, and other electronic resources. Once created, these points of interest can be placed anywhere in virtual space, adjusted, resized and ready for use.  Features:   1. Works with existing iQagent installations. 2. Create and Add Holographic POI objects to any equipment or process area for instant access to relevant PLC or SCADA data, schematics, documents, forms or videos.  3. Scan existing iQagent POI (QR) Codes to access related POI object 4. Add holographic single data point values near sensors or data sources 5. Add holographic links to documents forms or videos. 6. POIs and objects remain where you left them between iQagent sessions.   Augmented and Mixed Reality is the future of the plant floor. Stay ahead of the curve and try iQagent AR free today."

See how long you can survive. Very fun first person holographic shooter based on the 2d game Galaxy Defender found at www.cresidio.com.  Our goal with Galaxy Defender for Hololens was to conceptually bring our successful 2d Galaxy Defender game into the 3d world.  One of the things that helped to make the original Galaxy Defender game a success was that it was designed as an endless shooter arcade game. A game where you try to go as far as you can for as long as you can for the amount of time you have. A player who was waiting for a bus or standing in line at Disney could fire up the game and begin playing immediately and get lots of enjoyment shooting and blasting things and collecting power ups. If the user had a few hours to kill they could continue on trying to beat their last high score. We wanted to bring that same experience into Galaxy Defender for Hololens so a user with only a few minutes could play it or someone who had a much longer amount of time.

Haro3D is mainly aimed at scientists and engineers already familiarized with LabVIEW. Haro3D is an application running on the Hololens that communicates through the network with a LabVIEW application running on a separate computer.  The Haro3D Hololens app combined with the Haro3D library provides interactivity of Hololens users with a LabVIEW application through manipulations, voice commands, and menus; upload of LabVIEW 3D objects in the Hololens space, and real time display of front panels of LabVIEW VIs and controls. The Haro3D app also provides the ability, through LabVIEW, to share holograms between multiple Hololens using a common coordinate system. The Haro3D app running on the Hololens requires that the computer running LabVIEW has the Haro3D library version 2 installed. The Haro3D library version 2 requires LabVIEW 2016 or later, 32 or 64 bit version. LabVIEW must be installed before installing the Haro3D library. The Haro3D library can be installed for a 30-day free trial from National Instruments LabVIEW Tools Network (http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/213510), by simply using the link vipm://harotek_lib_haro3d, or by searching for Haro3D in the VIPM application from JKI.

The aim is to combine VR with Kolb’s method of experiential learning to achieve the best results for students. It is expected to gain higher retention rates of knowledge among participants.  First scene will be an Antarctic experience which will allow students to put on the virtual reality headset and enter the world of the Antarctic. The scenario begins where a scientist will introduce the topic and explain the reasoning for their presence, their significance with the ecology, and what are some of the activities that take place.  She will then tell you to take a photo of a penguin for research purposes. There will be different resources given to the student staggered throughout the experience to see their intuitiveness of the setting and their grasping of the resources regarding problem-solving. The introduction will be a blend of science and geography, and the experience will allow the students to get a first-hand feel into a day in the life of an Antarctic scientist."

See https://iform.us. Loci is a method of loci mixed reality mind mapping application located in a virtual reality memory palace. It combines the method of loci memory technique and 3D mixed reality interaction with mind maps (graphs) to support you on your personal analysis tasks. These tasks can include looking for an apartment, finding out more about a disease, or deciding on a next job.  Features initial import capability using ""Load Graph"" voice command for MindManager, Freemind, and GraphML format files.  Why - Loci uses three core concepts to help you organize, understand and remember; mind maps let you break a problem down into component parts to organize and do analysis, mixed reality interaction with mind maps lets you visualize in 3D to understand how they are related, and the method of loci persistent placement of mind map nodes lets you improve your recall of the mind map, even when you are not using the Loci software.  In this way you can organize your problem, understand it, and remember it later when you need to use that information for decisions.  How - Loci is built for the Microsoft Mixed Reality. Loci supports spatial mapping so you can place nodes from your mind maps in relevant locations in your memory palace. Loci uses voice, gaze and gestures to enable you to make your 3D graphs (mind maps). You start by saying ""add node"" to make a node representing the problem you are working on, then you look at this node and again say ""add node"" to add more nodes for attributes of the problem, so you have a visualization of your problem. You can say ""load image"" to add nodes with images from files. You can link nodes together to show how they are related to each other. To load and save mind maps you use File Explorer or OneDrive. To help you understand how Loci works, it has a seven day free trial.  Where - Where you place and do things is very important to your memory.  Locations in your memory palace are important to you. They have meaning that you effectively recall, and with Loci you can combine your visual and spatial memory.  When - Loci helps you on longer term problems you are working on, where you need to apply your capabilities for cognition. You may return to these problems over a span of weeks or months to arrive at the right decision. You use Loci when you have set aside time to do deep analysis at home or work.  Who - If you are solving complex problems, producing complex things, or planning or purchasing complex items or services, such as cars, houses, college, stocks, or medical treatment, you could benefit by organizing, understanding, and remembering your information by using Loci to link in your mind."

Move around the museum to follow the story of water in London and look at the working steam machines in the museum.  The London Museum of Water & Steam is an independent museum founded in 1975 as the Kew Bridge Steam Museum.  Situated on the site of the old Kew Bridge Pumping Station in Brentford, near Kew Bridge on the River Thames in West London, England, the museum is centred on a collection of stationary water pumping steam engines dating from 1820 to 1910. It is the home of the world’s largest collection of working Cornish engines, including the Grand Junction 90 inch, the largest such engine in the world. The site is an anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH).  Kew Bridge Pumping Station was originally opened in 1838 by the Grand Junction Waterworks Company, following a decision to close an earlier pumping station at Chelsea due to poor water quality. In the years up to 1944 the site expanded, ultimately housing six steam pumping engines as well as four Allen diesel pumps and four electric pump sets. The steam engines were retired from service in 1944, although two were kept on standby until 1958, when a demonstration run of the Harvey & Co. 100 inch engine marked the final time steam power would pump drinking water at the site.  The Metropolitan Water Board decided not to scrap the resident steam pumping engines and set them aside to form the basis of a museum display at a later date. This action bore fruit in 1974 with the formation of the Kew Bridge Engines Trust, a registered charity, by a group of volunteers previously involved in the restoration of the Crofton Pumping Station.  Today the site is an internationally recognised museum of working steam pumping engines, a reminder of the many pumping stations spread throughout London and the UK. In 1999, the United Kingdom government Department for Culture, Media and Sport described Kew Bridge as ""the most important historic site of the water supply industry in Britain"".  The Kew Bridge Engine Trust and Water Supply Museum Limited, a registered charity, has three aims:  1) to restore (and maintain) the five historic beam engines at the Kew Bridge site 2) to add other important water pumping engines 3) to establish a museum of London's water supply.  In 1997 the museum was awarded an Engineering Heritage Award by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and Britain’s Institute of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE). A second IMechE Engineering Hallmark was awarded in 2008 for the restoration of the Bull engine, making the museum one of only 12 sites to achieve more than one of these awards."
