So if you get Pixel Ripped 1995 and get hooked by all the wackiness, be sure to come back and get 1978 'cause it's totally groovy!Pixel Ripped is back with a brand new nostalgia-fueled virtual reality game-within-a-game, this time in the year 1995! To restore balance to multiple dimensions, our videogame hero Dot recruits the help of the best gamer from 1995, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David.
