tag_jj ※This content supports PlayStation®Move motion controller. Airtone is a brand-new type of VR rhythm game that allows you to enter a virtual world along with the main character, Neon. The spectacular music and visuals make for an all-new arcade rhythm game experience! With sophisticated VR game controls, the player matches the hand controllers to markers as they fly down the lanes. There are three kinds of markers, "smash", "trigger", and "press and hold". Hit these markers in time to the music as you soar through the air. Airtone boasts a deep story that sets it apart from other rhythm games. The player receives support from Neon, and moves the story along by gathering the "Rhythm" residing in the music. As you progress through the game, you find out more and more about the mysteries surrounding Neon and the world you find yourself in.  Copyright: © AMG GAMES All rights Reserved.
