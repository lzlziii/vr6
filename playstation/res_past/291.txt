tag_jj You’ll need PlayStation®VR and a PlayStation®Camera to play Tumble™ VR.   ※This item is also offered in a pack.   Puzzle it out! Are you a strategic thinker? Do you have a steady hand and nerves of steel? Do you enjoy building towers or are you more of a demolition demon? With over 70 fiendishly addictive levels of balancing, building and demolishing, Tumble™ VR – exclusive to PlayStation®VR – will test your physical and mental dexterity to the max.   Get hands-on with gravity-defying building tasks where the highest tower gets the biggest score, or take on tricky balancing acts with blocks of all shapes, sizes, weights and dimensions. Enjoy blowing things up? Lay mines in tactical positions to topple towers and score points for the biggest blast radius.   Solve puzzles together with friends or go head-to-head in social screen play, where what you see on your PlayStation®VR headset’s screen is what your friends see on their TV.
