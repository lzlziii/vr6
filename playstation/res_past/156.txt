tag_jj ※PlayStation®Move motion controller is required to play this content. Craft Wonders Amongst the Clouds! Fantastic Contraption is a surreal building game for the PS VR. Come immerse yourself in a strange skybound archipelago and befriend Neko the photosynthesizing cat. Create intricate machines, then send them whirling, flinging, and trundling off to solve puzzles on the other side of a floating island.  Your task is simple: get the squishy purple ball to that goal off in the distance, or above you, or on the other side of that gap. Your tools are elegantly minimalist: spinning wheels and stretchable rods. But the solutions are endless, and there are no right or wrong ones. Every level is infinitely replayable - this is a VR experience you and your friends will play for hours.
