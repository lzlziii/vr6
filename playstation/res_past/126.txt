tag_jj 2 PlayStation®Move motion controllers are required to play this game.   Unforgettably vivid cocktail from emotions, in which we’ve added everything to make a player fall out of reality for a while to receive exactly these bright and fresh emotions we’ve only experienced when were kids. The game will generously reward you for a desire to move actively – you can evade bullets, shut them down, and hide behind the objects while shooting back in your enemies. Impressive spectrum of weapons (firearms, throwing weapons, and even futuristic arms) that will allow you to feel like an experienced shooter who is capable of dealing with hordes of attacking enemies alone. We advise you to start from easy levels in order to receive more seamless gaming experience and get tired much lesser.   Copyright: © 2019.
