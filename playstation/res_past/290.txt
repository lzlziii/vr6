tag_name Thumper (Game)
tag_jj Thumper is rhythm violence: classic rhythm-action, blistering speed, and brutal physicality. You are a space beetle. Brave the hellish void and confront a maniacal giant head from the future.  Scream down the endless track and crash through punishing obstacles with simple, airtight controls. Hurtle forward, master new moves, reach overwhelming velocities, and survive adrenalizing boss battles. Every crushing impact is interwoven with a pounding original soundtrack. To reach synesthetic bliss, you must go through rhythm hell.  Feel the violence in ultra-glossy 2D or fully immersive VR.  Copyright: Copyright 2016 Drool LLC. All Rights Reserved.
