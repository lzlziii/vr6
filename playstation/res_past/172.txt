Déraciné is a classic adventure game brought to life by the latest VR technology, a virtual adventure that helps us recall the joy of discovery. Created by SIE JAPAN Studio and FROMSOFTWARE, the partnership that brought us Bloodborne.   Copyright: ©2018 Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. Developed by FromSoftware, Inc.
