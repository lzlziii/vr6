tag_jj ※This content supports PlayStation®Move motion controller. In Bonfire, the latest VR experience from the award-winning Baobab Studios, you play the leading role. As Space Scout 817, you are on a mission to discover a new home for the human race after it has made a mess of Earth. Too bad your piloting skills lack… precision. You crash-land at night on a mysterious unknown planet three-hundred light-years from Earth. Your only source of light is your makeshift bonfire. Beyond its glow everything falls to darkness. And what are those strange noises coming from the alien jungle? To survive you only have your instincts and robot sidekick, Debbie, voiced by Ali Wong, Debbie’s companionship comes with a signature wariness. When a chance meeting with a local inhabitant further steers your mission off course, you learn that unexpected encounters just might result in lasting friendships. You’ll have the opportunity to embrace, explore and influence the world around you. In the end, the choice is yours: Will you follow your captain or your conscience?  Copyright: @ Baobab Studios Inc.
