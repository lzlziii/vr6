tag_jj The entire game is playable in both VR and non-VR, and playing in VR with headphones on delivers the most immersive experience. In VR, you can look where you want to swim and turn just by tilting your head, similar to how a real dolphin would. This game is available in Simplified Chinese.  ※This content supports PlayStation®Move motion controller during VR experience. Jupiter & Mars is an underwater adventure set in a future-Earth in which everything science warned us about has come to pass: sea levels have risen from melting ice caps and climate change. Since man's disappearance, the oceans have begun to reclaim themselves, with coral and nearly extinct creatures returning to their once-thriving levels. But the artifacts of man's presence still remain, and an elite race of whales known as the Elders enlist Jupiter and Mars to help neutralize a global network of machines that are disrupting sea life. Along the way, Jupiter and Mars will perform incredible feats and maybe even survive to tell the tale.  Copyright: © 2019 Tigertron. Jupiter & Mars™ All rights reserved.
