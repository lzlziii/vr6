tag jj|||Add True Damage (feat. Becky G., Keke Palmer, SOYEON, DUCKWRTH, Thutmose) - “GIANTS” to your song library  Virtual hip-hop group True Damage showed they were “bigger than giants” in the 2019 World Cup Finals cinematic featuring League champions Akali, Ekko, Senna, Qiyana and Yasuo.  About the League of Legends Music Pack It’s time to chase your legend as Synth Riders brings you the League of Legends Music Pack. Featuring music created for “League of Legends”, one of the most widely played video games of all time with an E-sports scene to match, this pack features songs from Riot Games’ own supergroups K/DA and True Damage alongside two epic League Event anthems that will inspire you towards victory!  Synth Riders continues to build the diversity of its musical offerings in this pack. Fans of the R&B attitude and pop style of K-pop can now dance to the K/DA-inspired choreographies for smash hits “POP/STARS” and “MORE”, while lovers of hip-hop can feel the power and flow of every word of “GIANTS”. Grand cinematic anthems from some of League’s biggest events complete the pack, with Valerie Broussard calling players to battle in “Awaken”, while Against The Current remind us all that “Legends Never Die”.  Included in this pack is a Synth Riders Experience for “Legends Never Die”, inspired by the gameplay and characters of League of Legends. With visuals synchronized to the music, Synth Riders offer fans of the game a uniquely immersive way to feel the heat of battle and re-live the song’s performance inspired by the 2017 World Finals Opening Ceremony featuring the Elder Dragon.
