tag name|||UNFRAMED: Hand Puppets - Paul Klee
tag jj|||With the help of a precise and faithful reproduction of the puppets that Paul Klee made for his son, this fourth episode of the virtual reality series Hors-Cadre sets out to discover the many facets of the artist and his work. Part fiction, part documentary, the puppets themselves recount the major events and important aspects of his career and life. From his difficult artistic beginnings to his position as a professor at the Bauhaus, to the rise of Nazism, the experience offers a new look at the artist, his practice and his history.
