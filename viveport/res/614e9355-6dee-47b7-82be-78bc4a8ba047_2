tag jj|||Axon's Community Engagement Training VR product is designed to help train officers de-escalate encounters with various persons in the community. Our CET scenarios range from responding to crisis calls involving the mentally ill, to intervening on a fellow officer who may be unnecessarily escalating a situation to the brink of misconduct.  These VR scenarios are filmed in 360 video with live-actors, and follow a scripted narrative that trainees have the ability to progress through in a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure format. The scenarios focus on the foundational skills and tactics needed to successfully and peacefully resolve difficult types of calls for service, while also providing officers the ability to experience first-hand what an individual may be going through during a law enforcement encounter.
