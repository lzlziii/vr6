tag jj|||Add The Interrupters - “Gave You Everything” to your song library  The Interrupters step away from ska-punk to give us a classic breakup song with a hard rocking edge, where The Interrupters’ lead singer Aimee Allen brings an energy and attitude worthy of Joan Jett, one of her early musical inspirations.  About the Adrenaline Pack Get ready for Synth Riders to kick out your expectations, smash down the VR music rhythm game stereotypes and have you jumping straight into the mosh pit as you dance along to the Adrenaline pack - headlined by Californian punk rock legends The Offspring! Consisting of 8 songs in total, the 5 paid songs include “Self Esteem” and “Come Out And Play” from The Offspring’s “Smash” album alongside high-energy tracks from punk and ska-punk bands Bad Religion, Rancid and The Interrupters. Also included for free with “Come Out And Play” is the second Synth Riders Experience, this time packed with punk style and rock attitude tailored to match this track by The Offspring! To make sure everyone gets a shot of adrenaline, the pack is completed with 3 free songs featuring classic punk from Pennywise, and post-punk from Too Close To Touch and Plague Vendor.
