tag jj|||Add Lindsey Stirling - ”Mirage” to your song library  This collaboration with songwriter-rapper and dancer Raja Kumari is full of Indian cultural influence, with lyrics in Hindi and Bollywood musical drama.  Lindsey writes "A glimmering mirage in the distance can pull us away from the sustaining reality that is at our fingertips."  About the Lindsey Stirling Music Pack  Come and explore a world “Underground” in Synth Riders with the Lindsey Stirling Music Pack.  This pack captures Lindsey’s expressive and energetic playing style as you ride the rails and soar with her violin in five tracks spanning her career.  A multi-talented musician, songwriter and dancer, Lindsey Stirling blends her trademark violin with a multitude of musical styles.  This pack highlights her diversity and versatility: whether playing alongside the powerhouse vocals of Lzzy Hale in “Shatter Me”, exploring her Celtic musical influences in “First Light”, in collaboration with Raja Kumari on the Bollywood-inspired “Mirage” and even in the Synthwave-inspired “Shadows”, Lindsey’s violin is your guide.  As an artist with a strong sense of visual style, the Synth Riders Experience for “Underground” is heavily inspired by the striking imagery of Lindsey’s own video for the song, while continuing to explore themes of confinement and freedom, key inspiration for the song itself.  This Synth Riders Experience is very much a playable video clip, with its hand crafted visuals matched perfectly to the music creating a truly unique, immersive way to experience music.
