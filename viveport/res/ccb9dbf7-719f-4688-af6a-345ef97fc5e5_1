tag jj|||Add Muse - ”Uprising" to your song library  Song Description Muse’s best selling single of all time from the 2009 album “The Resistance”, has the band blending glam rock and 80s synths into a song about mistrust of power and authority.  Music Pack Description The Muse Music Pack pays tribute to these incredible British electro-rockers, with five tracks including their best selling single of all time and spanning twelve years of their career, from 2006 to 2018. Influenced by electronic, progressive and glam rock, classical and rock opera, they blend these styles into a truly distinctive Muse sound, topped by Matt Bellamy’s soaring vocals.  Included in this pack is a tailored Synth Riders Experience for their massive hit, “Starlight”, a truly epic intergalactic rock ballad. Set sail across the oceans of space and time that separate a traveller from his loved ones, while he has a great “black hole revelation” of what truly matters in life and love. More than just a stage, these are artistically-driven, immersive visuals delivered in-game that result in the blending of sight, sound and movement together into something truly unique - a Synth Riders Experience.
