tag name|||Reddie and the Redirected Walker
tag jj|||We have prepared a mind altering experience that will demonstrate how we can extend a playspace with no teleportation or stick movement. You will explore a space naturally and it is probable your mind will be blown open like a cantaloupe (metaphorically).----IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CLEVER PEOPLE-----Please ensure you have a 2X2 meter room scale playspace before starting. If the scene goes dark it means you have put your head inside a wall - normally impossible without hurting yourself - or have left the designated play area (naughty).Please note: this is a short experience and a proof-of-concept for a larger VR game to demonstrate the power of Redirected Walking in Virtual Reality. Please let us know your thoughts and review in the comments below. The whole team is greatly looking forward to it and any feedback is greatly appreciated.Enjoy yourself!The Curvature Games Lab Team
