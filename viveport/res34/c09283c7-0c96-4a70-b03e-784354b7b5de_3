tag name|||Muse - "Algorithm (Alternate Reality Version)"
tag jj|||Add "Algorithm (Alternate Reality Version)" by Muse to your library!  The title track of Muse’s “Simulation Theory” is given an atmospheric, darkly symphonic treatment and combines with the included Synth Riders Experience to explore the song’s concept that we are caged in simulation.  Synth Riders returns to its roots with the “Synthwave Essentials Volume 2” music pack! This long-awaited sequel contains 8 carefully selected songs and is headlined by Muse with 2 tracks from their “Simulation Theory” album sitting alongside incredible Synthwave classics from FM-84, Gunship, The Midnight, 3FORCE and Essenger. For the first time ever in this pack, you can have a Synth Riders “Experience” as a part of the song “Algorithm” by Muse. More than just a stage, this is artistically-driven, immersive visuals delivered in-game that results in the blending of sight, sound and movement together into something truly unique - a Synth Riders Experience.
