tag name|||Icarus VR
tag jj|||Icarus is a virtual-reality adaptation inspired by the multidisciplinary show Icare, presented at the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde in 2014. This, Lemieux’s first VR work, is a co-production of Lemieux Pilon 4D Art and Normal Studio.Freely inspired by the infamous character from Greek mythology, Icarus is an immersive experience that literally wraps us in the skin of Icarus, the young man who burns his wings by flying too close to the sun. We move through his memories of the places and events from his childhood, privy to conversations with his father, Daedalus, leading up to his famous ascent and tragic downfall.---This linear narrative experience doesn't have mandatory interactions, but you can still wander a bit and move your arms around. You’ll surely try to reach out to the characters with your hands outstretched and beat your wings as you rise towards the sun, just like Icarus.
