tag name|||Shattered Lights
tag jj|||Shattered Lights is a one-of-a-kind, fully roomscale based VR horror game which takes you on a journey down a seemingly abandoned underground medical facility armed with nothing but a flashlight and your sanity. Using non-euclidean geometry the game will immerse you into a world where every single step you take is purely physical and you’ll never once have to use controllers to move around, even so, you’ll still be able to explore intricate areas, impossible geometry and any situation that Shattered Lights will throw at you. Do Note:Shattered Lights requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m (6 feet and 7 inches). There’s an option to play within a smaller space of 1.5m x 1.5m, but this is not recommended as it makes for a less stable experience, which some may experience as unpleasant.The Team:Team Morbid is a student team studying International Game Architecture & Design Programme at the Breda University Of Applied Sciences.Check out our Twitter! https://twitter.com/ShatteredLightsJoin us on Discord!discordapp.com/invite/dcwnvhc
