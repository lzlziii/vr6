The title, Kykeon, refers to the ritualistic potion that was drunk in Ancient Greece and believed to be the key to esoteric knowledge. By combining dance practice and immersive technology, the project’s main goal is to reexamine ancient ritualistic and folkloric practices as a way for moving forward as a society.Premiered inside of a bat cave in August 2020 as part of Slovakia’s Sensorium festival, the travelling exhibition also makes use of physical spaces associated with rituals. Once inside the physical cave, visitors wore the VR masks to begin a journey into a virtual cave, divided into three sequences. “You start to see things that you otherwise avoid seeing in your everyday life,” explains the artist. “In the first and second parts, you suffer the pangs of the world and see into its darkest corners. But you are reborn in the third part, and are able to communicate with spirit beings, celestial mechanics and forgotten harmonics.”In addition to shamanism, both data and dance lie at the heart of Kykeon. The idea itself was born when Judová was invited to develop a project between Finnish choreographer Taneli Törmä and a German research initiative known as Motion Bank which specialised in creating digital scores of physical choreographies. Using the markerless motion capture system Captury, professional dancers were recorded performing Törmä’s choreography, titled “Effect,” which Judová would go on to translate into an immersive VR experience.Judová and her team used techniques common in video effects and gaming to visualise the dancers’ movements digitally. The use of cutting-edge technology, including new features of the Unity game engine such as HDRP and VFX editor, result in unique visuals and an interactive, fully immersive experience. “Virtual Reality can literally be that window into a rich world that we are just not aware of,” says Judová. “It can expand our perceptions.”
