tag jj|||Add Caravan Palace - “Lone Digger” to your song libraryOne of the best known tracks from their 2015 Robotface album and hugely influential for the electro-swing genre which they helped to define, this is a perennial Caravan Palace fan favourite.About the Caravan Palace PackThe Caravan Palace Pack will have you dancing to five of our favourite tracks from this “eccentric electronic” group from France.  Heavily influenced by the Gypsy scene, Django Reinhardt and the sophisticated orchestrations of 1940s jazz, Caravan Palace fuses this with elements of future bass, trap, deep house and African house.  Their resulting sound is a blend of past and future that is “joyfully nostalgic”.  Be sure to put on your dancing shoes for some of their best known, high energy hits such as “Lone Digger” and “Rock it For Me”, hugely influential for the electro-swing genre which they helped define, and finish the night with the dreamy, optimistic pop chaser of “Miracle”.Also included in this pack is another unique Synth Riders Experience, and this time we’re taking you on a trip to Caravan Palace’s “Wonderland”!  Take the Experience Included with this track and you’ll step through a mysterious gate into a wonderful land - with candy, and jam, and ice cream!  Synth Riders Experiences are hand crafted animations inspired by and matched perfectly to the music that create a truly unique, immersive way to experience music.
