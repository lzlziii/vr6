tag name|||Speak Of The Devil
tag jj|||Awoken by a nightmare, you find yourself alone in your tent. A couple has set up camp uncomfortably close to your campsite. They are looking for something ancient. Undeterred by rumors of cult worship, and the various missing-persons reports over the years, they set off into territory clearly marked ‘no trespassing’. Compelled by an urge to follow, you set off to explore this isolated forest yourself.  As you venture deeper into the unknown parts of the wood, you discover strange burned effigies, bloody pentagrams, and mysterious runes--is there truth to this woman’s story? Screams pierce the stillness of the forest. Something ancient and demonic has awoken. Will you be able to escape with your life?
