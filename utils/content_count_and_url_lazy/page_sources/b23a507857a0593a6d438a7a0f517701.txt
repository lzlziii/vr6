          <br><u>Data protection information</u>&nbsp;<br>Protecting your data is very important to us.
To ensure transparent cooperation, we draw your attention to important
processing activities and special features.
To be able to use our services, please purchase and download
our apps, once available, from the Oculus Store and/or App Lab from Meta. Data processing
and payment procedures are carried out exclusively via Oculus/Facebook. We do not
collect or receive any personal data from you here. Further information on data
protection from Oculus can be found at https://www.oculus.com/legal/privacy-policy.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br><u style="">Purpose and legal basis of data processing</u>&nbsp;<br>Data processing at immerVR GmbH is carried out
to provide apps and services for immersive media in accordance with
Article 6 (1) (b) of the GDPR for pre-contractual or contractual measures.
These include:&nbsp;<br>• answering enquiries&nbsp;<br>• administration<br>• offer preparation, contract processing and
order processing&nbsp;<br>• providing the platform&nbsp;<br>• maintaining business relationships&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>&nbsp; As a company, we are subject to different legal
obligations. In order to fulfil these obligations, it may be necessary to
process personal data in the public interest pursuant to Article 6 (1c) of the
GDPR or Article 6 (1e) of the GDPR.&nbsp;<br>• control and reporting obligations&nbsp;<br>• creditworthiness, age and identity checks&nbsp;<br>• prevention of criminal acts&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Scope</u>&nbsp;<br>These data protection information shall apply
to the following offers and relevant subpages:&nbsp;<br>https://www.immerVR.com<br>https://www.imrVR.com<br>https://www.linkedin.com/company/immerVR<br>https://twitter.com/immerVR&nbsp;<br>https://www.youtube.com/immerVR<br>https://www.facebook.com/immerVR<br>https://instagram.com/immervr<br>https://www.tiktok.com/@immervr&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

protection information from one of our services, regardless of how you access or use it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br><u>Collection of personal data in our apps: immerGallery, immerGallery Demo and future apps</u>
          <br>We are working with Meta's Oculus Store and Meta's App Lab. We
collect, process and store the following data from you and use it for the
purpose of improving our apps, e.g. fixing a bug or creating a better user experience. In our apps, you can submit an internal developer log file with a current screenshot of the usage of our app to us, e.g. in the case a failure happens inside the app and you want to notify us about it. The legal basis is Article 6 (1)
(b) of the GDPR.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>• IP address, for the purpose of knowing if the report comes from the same user within keeping the same IP address&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>• submission date, time and time zone for the purpose of knowing when incidents/bugs happened<br>• data in the app log file might reveal used path and file names on the system where the app is running for the purpose of understanding as developer from which location which files were loaded. It contains the used version number of the app for the purpose of knowing in which app version the incident/bug happened. It might contain which buttons and interactions happened during the app usage, which virtual reality system is used with what kind of input controllers for the purpose of reconstructing what lead to the incident/bug. Furthermore, the used screen frequency is shown and the status of relevant Android permissions to run the app for reconstructing the environment settings for the incident/bug. HMD-specific events like HMDAcquired, HMDMounted, VrFocusAquired, TrackingAquired, and according lost events are stored in the log file for reconstructing the scenario of the incident/bug. Recentering events and the result of the Oculus user entitlement check are stored for reconstructing the events. If a local config file is used for the app, the values of that config file are transmitted, e.g. keeping the option "FloorFor2D" enabled during program restarts for the purpose of replicating the same settings when the incident/bug happened. System memory statistics like the total amount of reserved memory, texture memory, texture count, frame rate, frame time, draw call, number of triangles, amount of mesh memory, CPU and GPU levels over time and the status of the internal garbage collection can be included in the log files for giving the developers an overview of the system status and resources. Results of the recognition of the voice control might be included in the log files, but no audio data for the purpose of improving voice control with wrongly detected inputs. Statistics about the app usage, e.g. the number of app starts or the usage time of the app over multiple sessions might be included when sending the log file for the purpose of giving further information for debugging issues.<br>• the screenshot shows what the user is currently seeing, e.g. a photo, for the purpose of having a visual representation of what the user saw during the bug/incident<br>
          <br>
          <br>During run-time, the app itself is not using user-specific data by itself (excluding of course user inputs or content provided by the user). However, the requried call to the Oculus Entitlement check might internally use user data to verify the entitlement status. We do not have access to that user-specific data, please refer to the Oculus Store, Oculus Terms and Conditions and Oculus Privacy Policy for further information.<br>
          <br>Voice control in the apps are executed locally. No audio is submitted to a cloud or another server. As mentioned above, we might store the recognized voice controls as text in the log file, which is only sent upon the user's explicit and voluntary command to us.<br>
          <br>In the case where we have user-specific data from you, you can request that data by contacting us at the address (see email above or postal address) above while providing evidence of your user identity. Furthermore, you can request that your user-specific data is deleted through contacting us through the email address mentioned above.<br>
          <br>As determined by the Oculus Store, Oculus Terms and Conditions and Oculus Privacy Policy, Oculus/Facebook/Meta might collect data from you automatically while using our app. We do not have influence on this and cannot enable or disable this. Data might include: user ratings of the app, time spent in the app, if user has been using the app within the last 28 days, averaged data over multipe users regarding age, gender, country, region and similiar properties. Furthermore, crash statistics might be automatically created by Oculus/Facebook/Meta and include information about the used devices (e.g. Quest, Quest 2), regions of the user and so on.&nbsp;We do not have influence on this and cannot enable or disable this.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>For Meta Quest devices, we may use platform features such as User ID (grants an app access to the user id to enable various features), User Profile (grants an app access to the Oculus username and profile photo) and Avatars (grants an app access to Oculus Avatars, a persistent identity across the Oculus ecosystem. With Oculus avatars, users can bring their own visual identities into our app). These will be used in accordance with the Oculus&nbsp;Developer Data Use Policy (https://developer.oculus.com/policy/data-use/).<br>
          <br>Our virtual reality apps are based on the Unity game engine. We do not have influence on this or access to the data, but Unity might do the following:&nbsp;Unity has collected some or all of the following information about your device: unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices); IP address; country of install (mapped from IP address); device manufacturer and model platform type (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc.) and the operating system and version running on your system or device; language; CPU information such as model, the number of CPUs present, frequency, and instruction set support flags; the graphics card type and vendor name; graphics card driver name and version (e.g., “nv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71”); which graphics API is in use (e.g., “OpenGL 2.1” or “Direct3D 9.0c”); amount of system and video RAM present; current screen resolution; version of the Unity Editor used to create the game; sensor flags (e.g., device support for gyroscope, touch pressure or accelerometer); application or bundle identification (“app ID”) of the game installed; unique advertising identifiers provided for iOS and Android devices (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID); and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it transmitted correctly.<br>

          <br>If you decide to use our Reddit channels, please be aware of the privacy policy of Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy). Reddit may use your user information, login data, content you post, actions you take and other information&nbsp;in order to at least provide, maintain, and improve the services; Personalize services, content, and features that match your activities, preferences, and settings, help protect the safety of Reddit and their users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit User Agreement and other policies; Provide, optimize, target, and measure the effectiveness of ads shown on their Services; Research and develop new services; Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages; Provide customer service; Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information Reddit thinks will be of interest to you; and Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with Reddit's services.

          <br>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline !important;">Use of
Google Adwords Conversion</span>&nbsp;<br>We use
the offer of Google Adwords Conversion to draw attention to our attractive
offers with the help of advertising materials (so-called Google Adwords) on
external websites. In relation to the data of the advertising campaigns, we can
determine how successful the individual advertising measures are. We thus
pursue the interest to show you advertisements that are of interest to you, to
make our website more interesting for you and to achieve a fair calculation of
advertising costs. The legal basis for the
processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR.
These
advertising materials are delivered by Google via so-called “Ad Server”. For
this purpose, we use ad server cookies, through which certain parameters for
measuring success, such as displaying ads or clicks by users, can be measured.
If you reach our website via a Google ad, Google Adwords stores a cookie on
your PC. These cookies usually lose their validity after 30 days and are not
intended to identify you personally. For this cookie, as a rule, the unique
cookie ID, the number of ad impressions per placement (frequency of the
insertions), last impression (relevant for post-view conversions, i.e. the
number of advertisements before clicking on them) and opt-out information
(marking that the user no longer wants to be addressed) are stored as analysis
values.
These
cookies allow Google to recognise your Internet browser. If a user visits
certain pages of the website of an Adwords customer and the cookie stored on
his computer has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognise that
the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page. Each
Adwords customer is assigned a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be
tracked through the websites of Adwords customers. We ourselves do not collect
and process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising measures. We
only receive statistical evaluations provided by Google. Based on these
evaluations, we can see which of the advertising measures used are particularly
effective. We do not receive any further data from the use of advertising
material, in particular we cannot identify the users on the basis of this
information.
Due to
the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct
connection to the Google server. We have no influence on the scope and further
use of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore
inform you according to our state of knowledge: By integrating AdWords
Conversion, Google receives the information that you have accessed the
corresponding part of our website or clicked on an ad from us. If you are
registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your account.
Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, there is a
possibility that the provider will know and save your IP address.
You can prevent participation in this tracking
procedure in several ways: a) by setting your browser software accordingly, in
particular, suppressing third-party cookies will prevent you from receiving
third-party advertisements; B) by disabling the conversion tracking cookies by
setting your browser to block cookies from the domain
“www.googleadservices.com”, https://www.google.de/settings/ads<a href="https://www.google.de/settings/ads" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">,</a> where this setting is deleted when you delete your cookies; C) by
disabling the interest-based advertisements of the providers that are part of
the “About Ads” self-regulatory campaign via https://www.aboutads.info/choices , where this setting is deleted
when you delete your cookies; D) by permanently deactivating your browsers
Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome under  https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. We would like to point out that in this case, you
may not be able to make full use of all the functions of this offer.

Ads and Reddit Conversion Tracking</u>&nbsp;<br>We may place advertisements on Reddit (Reddit Ads).
We also use Reddit’s analytics and conversion tracking technology to assess the
effectiveness of this advertising.
Responsible for data processing is:
Reddit, Inc., 548 Market St. #16093, San
Francisco, California 94104.
Reddit places a cookie on your computer if you
have accessed our website via a Reddit advertisement. These cookies lose their
validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If you
visit certain pages of the website of a Reddit Ads customer and the cookie has
not yet expired, Reddit and the customer can recognise that you have clicked on
the ad and have been redirected to this page. Each Reddit Ads customer receives
a different cookie. Cookies cannot therefore be tracked through the websites of
Reddit Ads customers. The information obtained with the help of the conversion
cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Reddit Ads customers who
have opted for conversion tracking. Reddit Ads customers learn the total number
of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a
conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive any information with which
users can be personally identified.
The legal basis for data processing is your
consent in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR. The purpose
of data processing is to inform you about our offer and to make it clear and
user-friendly for you.
This cookie expires after 30 days and is not used
for personal identification. You have the possibility to revoke your consent to
data processing at any time. Please contact us under the above data.
As
a logged in user of reddit, you can object to the storage and use of data in a
Reddit cookie by visiting https://www.reddit.com/personalization and selecting your preferred settings.
If you choose this option, a new cookie (opt-out
cookie) is set in your browser, which informs Reddit that no data relating to
your browsing behaviour may be stored. Please note that the setting must be
made for all browsers you are using. If all your cookies are deleted in a
browser, this also affects the opt-out cookie of Reddit.
In
summary, we would like to say that we do not evaluate user data, IP addresses
are always anonymised. We can evaluate search terms, expected age and pages
visited. If you have any questions, please contact us.&nbsp;<br>
