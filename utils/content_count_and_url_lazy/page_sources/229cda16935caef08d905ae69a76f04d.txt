The Site is not designed to respond to "do not track" requests from browsers.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Cookies</h3> <p>This information is stored using session ID cookies, persistent cookies and various other types of cookies. A cookie is a small data file that is stored by your web browser on your computer.</p> </li> <li> <h3>Third party Information</h3> <p>To help us understand and enhance our interactions with you, we may permit web analytics and other providers to collect and process information on our Site using the technologies described above. Some of these providers have information about you, including personal information, demographic information and interest reports which they will share with us. And we may share your personal and technical information with them.</p> </li></ol><h2>Using Information We Collect</h2><p>We want to provide you with the best possible internet experience and fulfill your orders exactly as you've requested. Additionally, we want to make your experience with Market America a pleasant and positive one. In order to do this, we may use any information we collect for any legitimate business purpose (including, but not limited to, marketing). For example, we may use the information as follows:</p><ol> <li> <h3>Use of Personal Information</h3> <ul> <li>Match you with the Shop Consultant that is the best possible fit for you;</li> <li>Send you promotional offers;</li> <li>Identify your product and service preferences;</li> <li>Customize our communications to you;</li> <li>Improve our customer service;</li> <li>Share your positive product testimonial with others;</li> <li>Include your name, stories, testimonials, product reviews and images in Market America and third party publications, literature and/or other media, on Market America operated websites, on third party websites, at Market America events, on Market America CDs and DVDs, in any other Market America communications to our UnFranchise Owners, partner stores, third party service providers or others, or as otherwise deemed useful or appropriate by Market America.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <h3>Use of Technical Information</h3> <p>This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the Site and to various sections of the Site, the percentage of visits that came from particular key word searches, the average time spent on the Site by visitors, and the average number of page views by visitors. It may also be used to identify system performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us improve the Site, analyze patterns of usage, and to make the Site more useful.

In order to best service our customers and Preferred Customers, we may share any information we collect for any legitimate business purpose. For example, when we share your order information, we share some of your personal information and information about your spending habits with the Market America Independent UnFranchise Owner ("UnFranchise Owner") assigned as your Shop Consultant. UnFranchise Owners are obligated to treat the information you supply with confidentiality.</p><p>We share certain limited information with the partner stores where you shop. We may also share your personal and technical information with web analytics companies and services in order to provide a more personalized web experience for you.</p><p>We use third party service providers to help us operate our business, the Site and the Mobile App, provide certain services or administer activities on our behalf, such as credit card processing, sending emails, shipping orders, printing, web design and hosting, public and media relations, internet services, e-commerce, order fulfillment and contest/sweepstakes administration. We will share your information with these third parties for those purposes. For example, whenever you place an order through the Site, we will provide your name, address, phone numbers and other information required by the shipper so that the shipper can efficiently deliver your order according to their internal and legal requirements.</p><p>If we offer sweepstakes, contests and/or similar promotions through the Site we will ask you for certain personally identifiable information when you enter and if you win. We will share this personally identifiable information with the third party sponsors of such sweepstakes, contests and promotions (irrespective of whether it is hosted by us) or others, in accordance with the rules for such sweepstakes, contest or promotion. You should carefully review the rules for each sweepstakes, contest and promotion offered through the Site before you participate, as they may contain additional information about the use of your personally identifiable information by us or the sponsor. If there is a conflict between the rules concerning the treatment of your personally identifiable information and this Privacy Policy, the rules shall control.</p><p>On rare occasions, we may disclose specific information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so. We may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.</p><h2>California Residents</h2><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 permits consumers, who are California residents, to request information about the personal information collected and shared with third parties in the preceding calendar year.

E-mails may be sent in order to assist us in processing your order, respond to a request, provide customer service or inform you about products, services or promotional materials. It is our intent to send promotional e-mails only to those persons who wish to receive them. We provide instructions on how to unsubscribe in our e-mails.</p><h2>Links to Other Sites</h2><p>From time to time, we provide links to third party sites on the Site and the Mobile App. These sites operate independently of Market America and have established their own privacy and security policies.
