<h1>TENDER CLAWS PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<br>
<p>Last Updated: January 27, 2022</p>
<br>
<p>Tender Claws, LLC ("<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>") makes interactive products for personal entertainment. This Privacy Policy explains how we treat information from or about our users, including how we collect, use, and share information in connection with our software products Scottsdale and Virtual Virtual Reality (together, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).</p>
<br>
<p>By visiting or using our Services, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@tenderclaws.com">info@tenderclaws.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<h2>I. What kind of information is collected about you?</h2>

<p>We do not directly collect any personal information from your use of the Services. However, our platform partners, distributors, and game engines (the “<strong>Platforms</strong>”) provide us aggregated information regarding the performance of our Services. That aggregated information includes information such as crash rate, average users per day, average frame rate, average battery drain, average memory, and average session length.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>We do not have control over the information Platforms collect. You can review the applicable Platforms’ privacy policies and practices with respect to the information they collect below:</p>

<h2>II. How do we use your information?</h2>
<p>We use the information provided by the Platforms to diagnose bugs, provide support, and improve the Services.</p>
<br>
<h2>III. Who can get information about you?</h2>
<p>All information we receive about you is in aggregated form, deidentified prior to our receipt. Therefore we have no way of providing information about you, individually, and we do not have access to such information. We do not sell your personal information and have not sold personal information in the last 12 months.</p>
<br>
<h2>IV. What are your choices?</h2>
<p>When you download or access the Services, the Platforms may require you to login to your applicable Platform account. You may adjust your privacy and security settings with the applicable Platform; however, we do not have direct control over the information about you that Platforms collect, process, use, or disclose. If you have any concerns about the information we receive or process, please contact us.</p>
<br>
<h2>V. Security</h2>
<p>Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect the information we maintain, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to our Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of information.</p>
<br>
<h2>VI. International Users</h2>
<p>We are based in the United States, and, regardless of where you use our Services or otherwise provide information to us, the information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located in the U.S. or other countries. Note that the laws, regulations and standards of the country in which this information is stored may be different from your own country. By using our Services, you consent to this collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<br>
<h2>VII. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>We offer to our users a range of Services that are intended for users of all ages and their families. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records. If you believe that we might have any personal information from a child under 13, please contact us.</p>
<br>
<h2>VIII. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of such changes as appropriate, such as by sending you an email notification to the address you've provided, providing notice through the Services, and/or updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of these Terms.</p>
<br>
<h2>IX. California Residents</h2>
<p>As a California resident, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law. For purposes of this Section “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” has the meaning set forth in the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>.</p>
<br>
	<div class="indent">
<p><em>Information.</em> You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p role="presentation">The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p role="presentation">The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p role="presentation">The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p role="presentation">The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p role="presentation">Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p role="presentation">Whether we’ve sold your Personal Information, and if so, the categories of Personal Information received by each category of third party recipient.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><em>Access.</em> You can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.</p>
<br>
<p><em>Deletion.</em> You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</p>
<br>
<p><em>Nondiscrimination.</em> You are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination in the form of legally prohibited increases in the price or decreases in the quality of the Services.</p>
	</div>
	<br>
<p>You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:</p>
<br>
	<div class="indent">
<p><em>Right to information, access and deletion.</em> You can request to exercise your information, access and deletion rights by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@tenderclaws.com">info@tenderclaws.com</a>. We reserve the right to confirm your California residence and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests. As part of this process, government identification may be required. Consistent with California law, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government-issued identification. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.</p>
<br>
<p><em>Request a list of third party marketers.</em> California’s “Shine the Light” law (California Civil Code § 1798.83) allows California residents to ask companies with whom they have formed a business relationship primarily for personal, family or household purposes to provide certain information about the companies’ sharing of certain personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding year. You can submit such a request by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@tenderclaws.com">info@tenderclaws.com</a> with “Shine the Light” in the subject line. The request must include your current name, street address, city, state, and zip code and attest to the fact that you are a California resident.</p>
<br>
<p><em>We do not sell your personal information.</em> Based on our understanding of the term “sell” under the CCPA, we do not “sell” your Personal Information and have not sold it to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
