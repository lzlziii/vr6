This Policy also covers how personal and other information about you that we receive or collect through the Site is treated. Please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use of this Site.

					We do not collect any information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us to enable us to provide the Services to you.  While you are not required to provide us with information of any kind, but to do so may prevent you from using the Service or certain features of the Services.<br>
					<br>
					Additionally, we collect other information automatically when you use our Services, including:<br>
					<ul>
					<li>VR Hardware or device identifiers;</li>
					<li>Platform type;</li>
					<li>Device event information, including crash reports, request and referral URL's and system activity details (e.g. whether you encountered an error playing our games or lost internet access).</li>
					<li>When you participate in online games, in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics will be collected and may be visible to other players and users. </li>
					</ul>
					We do not knowingly collect or store any personal information from children under 13 or under the relevant age threshold in other jurisdictions where the child is located. However, we may collect technical information required for delivering the Services and for the support of our internal operations from all users of our Services. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their children’s other personal information or otherwise used their children’s personal information for another purpose, they may reach out to us via the contact address located.<br>
					<br>
					We recognize a special need to protect the personal information of children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information without parental permission, when online. We also recommend parents familiarize themselves with parental controls available on consoles, mobile telephones, tablets, and other devices they provide to their child and accompany their child if aged under 13 years of age when online.<br>
					<br>
					2. How We Use Information<br>
					<br>
					We will primarily use your personal information to provide product or service offerings to you. We will also use certain forms of personal information to enhance the operation of our Game and Site, improve our internal marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Game and Site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our Site’s content, layout, and services. We may use personal information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Finally, we may use your personal information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Game and Sites Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy.<br>
					<br>
					3. Sharing of Information<br>
					<br>
					We may share your information: (i) with our affiliate companies, vendors, and partners engaged by us, as well as our employees, contractors, officers, directors, representatives, and agents in order to provide you with goods or services you have requested, to ensure the success and functionality of our Services, the Site, and our business, or to facilitate online advertising selected by us; (ii) if required to do so by applicable law, regulation, or legal process; (iii) if necessary to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights; (iv) if necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of any person; and (v) in connection with the sale of our business or assets.

We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.<br>
					<br>
					Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personal information to the appropriate governmental authorities. In such cases, we will disclose such information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.<br>
