					<p><strong>Promotional Communications.</strong> We may use your personal information to send you updates (by email, text message, telephone or post) about our products AND/OR services, including exclusive offers, promotions or new products AND/OR services.</p>
					<p>We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal information for promotional purposes (see above “How and why we use your personal information”).

					<p>You have the right to opt out of receiving promotional communications at any time by:</p>

We also impose contractual obligations on service providers relating to ensure they can only use your personal information to provide services to us and to you. </p>
					<p>We may disclose and exchange information with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
					<p>We may also need to share some personal information with other parties, such as potential buyers of some or all of our business or during a re-structuring. We will typically anonymize information, but this may not always be possible. The recipient of the information will be bound by confidentiality obligations.</p>
					<p>We will not share your personal information with any other third party.</p>

				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Transferring Your Personal Information Out of the EEA.</strong> To deliver services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA), e.g.:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>With our offices outside the EEA;</li>
						<li>With your and our service providers located outside the EEA;</li>
						<li>If you are based outside the EEA; or</li>
						<li>Where there is an international dimension to the services we are providing to you.</li>
