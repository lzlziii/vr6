<p><span>NIVAL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED</span></p>
<p>PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>NIVAL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED (“Nival”) operates games in multiple territories worldwide. Depending upon the services you choose and the platform concerned, you may enter into a relationship with our company.</p>
<p>These Privacy Policy (i) apply to Nival’s online games and related services (the "Services"), and (ii) govern the relationship between you and Nival.</p>
<p>If you are using our Services through a social network, platform or applications provider (“Third Party Service”) (e.g., Facebook, Steam, iTunes, Google Play, etc.), any activities provided by such third party beyond Nival’s Services are governed by that Third Party Service’s policies.</p>
<p>If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of our Terms of Service or another policies of Nival, you must cease using the Services and your license to use the Services shall terminate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>AGREEMENT TO PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>By accessing any of Nival’s Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy (and any updates thereto). By so agreeing, you authorize us to collect and use your information as outlined below. In the event you do not agree with this Privacy Policy (and any amendments which may be adopted by us), your only recourse is to cease use of our Services.</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you are using our Services through a social network, platform or applications provider (“Third Party Service”) (e.g., Facebook, Steam, iTunes, Google Play, etc.), any activities provided by such third party beyond Nival’s Services are governed by that Third Party Service’s policies. We consider it a best practice for you to review the privacy policy of each website you frequent (as well as the privacy policies of any partners we may work with including advertisers) in order to be an informed consumer and to fully understand how your Personal Data is being handled.</p>
<p>PERSONAL DATA DEFINED</p>
<p>"Personal Data" is information that identifies you or that can be used to contact you (online or offline). Personal Data can include your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, gender, birthdate, etc.</p>
<p>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA AND PURPOSES</p>
<p>We collect Personal Data in a variety of ways in order to provide you with the best possible experience using our Services. Sources of information include:</p>
<p>Information You Provide To Us: You may choose to voluntarily provide us with information by registering or communicating with Nival. If you communicate with us, we will collect and record the information you have shared with us so that we can provide you with the Services or address your inquiry. During the registration process, we do collect basic information about you including your name and email address.</p>
<p>Third Party Platforms and Social Networks: When you participate in our Services which are provided through a Third Party Service, we may obtain information about you from that service such as your name, gender, geographic area and affiliations. For example, we may use your location in association with your user name to display your game score on a top player scoreboard. Your gender designation derived from a Third Party Service may also be shown but your gender will never limit you on the levels that you can achieve while playing the game (which in the free-to-play context reflects skill, not gender) and/or to a specific gameplay style or type of character. As a developer of an application which is provided through a Third Party Service, Nival is required to follow the governing policies of such Third Party Service (including the handling of Personal Data).</p>
<p>IP Addresses: We do monitor and store information about the IP addresses from which you access our Services. In general, these log files are used to monitor traffic on our Services, to troubleshoot technical problems and to collect aggregate information (e.g., to monitor and analyze demographic and preference information among our users). We may block certain IP addresses to comply with specific license agreements and/or in the event we detect user abuse of our Services. IP addresses could also be used to personally identify you in order to enforce our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Geolocation: Geolocation refers to the identification of the geographic location of a user or computing device via a variety of data collection mechanisms. Geolocation services use various means to ascertain location including network routing addresses, internal GPS devices and/or the newer W3C Geolocation standard. Our site may use various of these standards depending upon the platform and device that you are using to play our games.</p>
<p>Cookies: Nival utilizes cookies in connection with the operation of its Services. If you have registered to use our Services and/or play our games, your consent during the registration process means you have agreed to our use of cookies in accordance with applicable law and this Privacy Policy. Cookies are used on our site to facilitate user sign-on, and to retain user preferences and other information. Third party service providers may use cookies to track whether you have clicked on an advertisement and registered to play our games. A “cookie” is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Although your browser may be pre-set to accept cookies, you can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please note, however, that some parts of our Services will not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
<p>Other Data Collection Mechanisms: We may employ technologies including (i) clear Graphics Interchange Formats (“GIFs”) (i.e., web bugs, beacons or tags), which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us to advertise more efficiently by excluding our current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the source of a new installation or registration; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which help us to prevent fraud, remember your progress on certain in-game tasks and in-game settings. Clear GIFs are not used to collect Personal Data about you. However, we may use clear GIFs to capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page.</p>
<p>AGGREGATED DATA; NON-PERSONAL DATA GATHERING AND ANALYTICS</p>
<p>In addition to Personal Data, we collect a variety of data that is not used to specifically identify or contact you. This type of data is used to analyze and enhance our Services.</p>
<p>Examples of such information include:</p>
<p>General Use Information: We may collect general information about our users’ interaction with our product such as your internet protocol address, browser type, referring and exit URLs, clicks, domain names, pages viewed, the amount of time spent viewing a particular page, the time such activities took place, etc.</p>
<p>Game Play Information: We may collect and retain information relating to your interaction with our Services. For example, we may monitor the number and type of activities you participate in during a particular session, your scores and the length of time you spend on our Services.</p>
<p>Analytic Metrics Tool and Other Technologies: Nival uses its own tools and technologies to analyze non-Personal Data when you use our Services The information collected may include data about your hardware system, mobile device (if applicable), media, Internet and website usage and how you use our Services. We also analyze and track your game statistics, feature usage and purchase history, as well as IP, MAC, Android and/or iOS Addresses, and mobile ID (as applicable).</p>
<p>Third Parties: We may use service providers and third party tools and technology to provide you with a superior experience and these parties may share information they collect about you with us. Personal Data you provide to those third parties will fall under their respective privacy policies. If such a third party provides us with your Personal Data, we will handle it in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>USER GENERATED CONTENT</p>
<p>User generated content includes various types of content which is publicly available and is produced by end users. For example, wall posts, messages, and actions with other end users would fall under this definition. It is possible that the user generated content you choose to provide may contain Personal Data. Please be aware that we cannot guarantee protection for information you make available publicly through comments, information sharing mechanisms, wall posts, etc. Any user generated content you share while using our Services on a social network, will very likely be disseminated broadly through the social network. Also, any Personal Data that is publicly shared by the user could be harvested by third parties (including by other users of the social network) with access to it and we cannot control those third parties' use of such information. Please bear these factors in mind before sharing any content with us.</p>
<p>WHAT WE DO NOT DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION</p>
<p>Third Party Services - Social Network Data: We do not directly or indirectly transfer any Personal Data we receive from social networks such as Facebook or Google Play to third parties. However, you should recognize that we may display the information we receive from social networks within our Services.

<p>We May Log, But We Will Not Disclose, Individual Internet Protocol Addresses: We may maintain log files which contain IP addresses for purposes such as traffic monitoring. As you know, an IP address is a numeric address assigned to your computer (or router) by your Internet Service Provider. We will not disclose individual IP addresses to third parties.</p>

<p>In the event that we no longer operate a specific game through our Services, we may work with the subsequent game operator to offer you the ability to continue to play the game with the new game operator.

<p>LINKS</p>
<p>If you access our Services through a Third Party Service such as Facebook, links may appear in the same window or on screens before you commence playing. Any links you see adjacent to our Services may link you to parties completely unrelated to Nival. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for your use of their services or for any use of your Personal Data by such third parties and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as ourselves. The presence of a third party link within the Services does not represent an endorsement of the content of that third party's link and Nival disclaims all liability arising from such content.</p>
