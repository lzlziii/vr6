<h1>Privacy Policy for Noun Town Language Learning</h1>

Noun Town Language Learning (henceforth referred to as Noun Town) is a virtual reality (VR) language learning game developed by realiaXR. Noun Town is intended to educate and entertain. This Privacy Policy describes how we use, share, and protect information that we collect from players of Noun Town.

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>

We may collect anonymized information from your play of Noun Town to improve game performance and resolve bugs. Please note, Noun Town does not collect the playerâ€™s name, physical address, contact information, or any geolocation information. At any time a user may contact us via email (contact@noun.town) to request that any data collected or stored is deleted.  Noun Town records spoken words as part of the language learning process. These recordings are held in an anonymized way, with no personally identifiable information attached to recordings. Recordings are sent to a third party interpretation service as part of the translation process, and the privacy policy for this service can be found here: https://wit.ai/privacy


<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">USE OF INFORMATION</h2>

We use the information that we collect to analyse and improve our game and support the internal operations of Noun Town. We aggregate all information collected so that it cannot be used to identify any particular player.

<h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

We may revise this Privacy Policy, for example, to reflect changes in the law, our practises, or the features of Noun Town. These changes will be effective immediately upon posting. As a result, you should periodically review the Privacy Policy so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practises. By playing Noun Town you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and, by continuing to play Noun Town after changes have been made, you agree to the changes.
