            <p>The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to describe how VirtualSpeech collects, uses, and shares information about you through our online interfaces (e.g., websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by us, including but not limited to VirtualSpeech.com (referred to herein as the "Site"). Please read this Privacy Notice carefully to understand what we do. If you do not understand any aspects of our Privacy Notice, please feel free to <a target="_blank" href="https://virtualspeech.com/contact">contact us</a>.

            <h4 class="p-t">Information we collect</h4>

We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system, and browser software used by each user of the Site. We may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of their point of connectivity. Location data may be used to route your traffic to the nearest regional server to reduce latency and improve your experience. We may also use cookies and web beacons when you visit our Site.</li>
                <li><b>Personal Data provided directly by you or via third parties</b>.

In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. We also may share your Personal Data when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of VirtualSpeech, the Site, our users, customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.</li>

            <h4 class="p-t">Request or delete your data</h4>
            <p>To request the user data collected on you, or if you want us to delete the data collected on you, please contact: info@virtualspeech.com</p>

            <h4 class="p-t">Sharing your personally-identifiable information with third parties</h4>
            <p>We may be required to disclose personally-identifiable information in response to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share account or other personally-identifiable information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the VirtualSpeech name, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing personally-identifiable information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
            <h4 class="p-t">External links</h4>
            <p>For your convenience we may provide links to sites operated by organizations other than VirtualSpeech ("Third Party Sites") that we believe may be of interest to you. We do not disclose your Personal Data to these Third Party Sites unless we have a lawful basis on which to do so. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Sites. If you choose to click on a link to one of these Third Party Sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on the other site to understand how that Third Party Site collects and uses your Personal Data.</p>
            <h4 class="p-t">Information security</h4>
            <p>We consider the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. We will use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures to keep your Personally Identifiable Information confidential and secure and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, as permitted by applicable law. Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that email communications are typically not encrypted and should not be considered secure.</p>
