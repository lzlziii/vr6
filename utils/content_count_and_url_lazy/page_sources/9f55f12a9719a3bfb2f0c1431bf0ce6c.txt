For example:<br>‍<br>• <strong>Contact information</strong>. We may collect name, username or alias, email address, postal address, and phone number. <br>‍<br>• <strong>Demographic data</strong>. In some cases, such as when you participate in surveys, we request that you provide gender and similar demographic details.<br>‍<br>• <strong>Payment information</strong>. If you make a purchase or other financial transaction, we, or our third-party payment processors, collect credit card numbers, financial account information, and other payment details. <br>‍<br>• <strong>Content and files</strong>. We collect the photos, documents, or other files you upload to our services; and if you send us email messages or other communications, we will collect and retain those communications. <br><br><em>Information we collect automatically.</em> When you use our services, we collect some information automatically. For example:<br>‍<br>• <strong>Identifiers and device information</strong>. When you visit our websites, our web servers automatically log your Internet Protocol (IP) address and information about your device, including device identifiers (such as MAC address); device type; and your device’s operating system, browser, and other software including type, version, language, settings, and configuration. As further described in the Cookies, Mobile IDs, and Similar Technologies section below, our websites and online services store and retrieve cookie identifiers, mobile IDs, and other data.<br>‍<br>• <strong>Usage data</strong>. We automatically log your activity on our websites, apps and connected products, including the URL of the website from which you came to our sites, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times, and other details about your use of and actions on our website.<br><br><em>Information we create or generate.</em> We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics (“<strong>inferences</strong>”). For example, we infer your general geographic location (such as city, state, and country) based on your IP address.<br><br><em>Information we obtain from third-party sources.</em> We also obtain information from third parties. These third-party sources include, for example:<br>‍<br>• <strong>Third party partners</strong>. &nbsp;Third party applications and services, including social networks you choose to connect with or interact with through our services.<br><br>• <strong>Service providers</strong>. &nbsp;Third parties that collect or provide data in connection with work they do on our behalf, for example companies that determine your device’s location based on its IP address.<br><br>When you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline. And you may use web browser or operating system controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain services or features, those services or features may not be available or function correctly.</p></div><div><h3 class="tos-section-header">Cookies, Mobile Ids, and Similar Technologies</h3><p class="tos-paragraph">We use cookies, web beacons, mobile analytics and advertising IDs, and similar technologies to operate our websites and online services and to help collect data, including usage data, identifiers, and device information.<br><br><em>What are cookies and similar technologies?</em><br><br>Cookies are small text files placed by a website and stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.<br><br>Web beacons are electronic images (also called single-pixel or clear GIFs) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to tell us if you open and act on them.<br><br>Mobile analytics and advertising IDs are generated by operating systems for mobile devices (iOS and Android) and can be accessed and used by apps in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. Our apps contain software that enables us and our third-party analytics and advertising partners to access the mobile IDs.<br><br><strong>How do we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies?</strong><br><br>We, and our analytics and advertising partners, use these technologies in our websites, apps, and online services to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) when you use our services, including personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services. This information is used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our websites and apps perform, track your interaction with the site or app, develop inferences, deliver and tailor interest-based advertising, combat fraud, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. We and/or our partners also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes.<br><br>The third-party analytics and advertising providers we use on our websites include, for example: </p><div class="w-layout-grid grid-13"><div id="w-node-fa2bd44e-0ac3-8386-3d9f-b5e9d1708fa2-ebf893ba" class="text-block-12"><strong>Company</strong></div><div id="w-node-_6974f22d-f093-2e70-9126-a28b0bdff54f-ebf893ba" class="text-block-11"><strong>Service</strong></div><div id="w-node-c6722287-b760-7785-703e-acfa6ec8064d-ebf893ba"><strong class="bold-text-5">Privacy Notices</strong></div><div id="w-node-_97ea5195-69cf-47f8-4504-dbf76a89e5f2-ebf893ba" class="text-block-10"><strong class="bold-text-4">Manage Settings (Opt-out)</strong></div><div id="w-node-a06c6777-8f2c-adec-68c8-d26afdf55337-ebf893ba" class="text-block-13">Google</div><div id="w-node-b8804516-9a3c-ed0b-3dba-c7b2e83a2d18-ebf893ba" class="text-block-14">Google Analytics</div><div id="w-node-_941166d1-01ba-9798-5749-beffc37cf7aa-ebf893ba" class="text-block-15"><a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank" class="link-2">Link</a></div><div id="w-node-_4b948619-77ec-6370-096e-b982e4ca757f-ebf893ba" class="text-block-16"><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Link</a></div><div id="w-node-_567a6669-eb91-7b34-d6d5-5b4592537d85-ebf893ba" class="text-block-17">DoubleClick</div><div id="w-node-_00b480f6-ff5c-496f-98ea-3970ad3c93fe-ebf893ba" class="text-block-17">Advertising</div><div id="w-node-_7b14bc1b-bfc5-97f8-ee8b-558cc0152035-ebf893ba" class="text-block-17"><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Link</a></div><div id="w-node-_0d911e0b-181f-c805-9abd-f7edcd5aca26-ebf893ba" class="text-block-17"><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iba-opt-out-by-google/gbiekjoijknlhijdjbaadobpkdhmoebb?hl=en" target="_blank">Link</a></div></div><p class="tos-paragraph">To learn about their privacy practices and how to opt-out from their use of cookie data for targeted advertising purposes, click on the links above. You may also use the advertising and cookie controls described below.<br><br>What controls are available?<br><br>• <strong>Advertising controls</strong>. Our advertising partners may participate in associations that provide simple ways to opt out of ad targeting, which you can access at:<br>‍<br>-- United States: NAI (<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</a>) and DAA (<a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/">http://optout.aboutads.info/</a>)<br>-- Canada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (<a href="https://youradchoices.ca/">https://youradchoices.ca/</a>)<br>-- Europe: European Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>) <br><br>These choices are specific to the browser you are using. If you access our services from other devices or browsers, take these actions from those systems to ensure your choices apply to the data collected when you use those systems.<br><br>• <strong>Browser cookie controls</strong>. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.<br><br>• <strong>Mobile advertising ID controls</strong>. iOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.<br><br>• <strong>Email web beacons</strong>. Most email clients have settings which allow you to prevent the automatic downloading of images, including web beacons, which prevents the automatic connection to the web servers that host those images.<br><br>• <strong>Do Not Track</strong>. Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.<br><br><em>California “Do Not Sell My Personal Information.”</em><br><br>The California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) requires us to describe the categories of personal information we sell to third parties and how to opt-out of future sales. The CCPA defines personal information to include online identifiers, including IP addresses, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs. The law also defines a “sale” broadly to include simply making data available to third parties in some cases. &nbsp;We let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, and mobile IDs, along with associated device and usage data, when you access our online services, but we do not “sell” any other personal information. <br><br>If you do not wish for us or our partners to “sell” personal information relating to your visits to our sites for advertising purposes, you can make your Do Not Sell Request by emailing us or using the choices above. If you opt-out using these choices, we will not share or make available such personal information in ways that are considered a “sale” under the CCPA. &nbsp;However, we will continue to make available to our partners (acting as our service providers) some personal information to help us perform advertising-related functions. Further, using these choices will not opt you out of the use of previously “sold” personal information or stop all interest-based advertising.<br><br>Other information related to your right to opt-out from sales of personal information is contained in the California Privacy Rights section of this statement.</p></div><div><h3 class="tos-section-header">Our Use of Personal Data</h3><p class="tos-paragraph">We use the personal data we collect for purposes described in this privacy statement or otherwise disclosed to you.
