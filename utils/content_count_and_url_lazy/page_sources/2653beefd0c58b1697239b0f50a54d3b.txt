Notwithstanding the above, we cannot guarantee that our Service Providers will adhere to the contractual obligations or acceptable business practices. While we strive to protect the information provided to our Service Providers, we have no direct control over their use of the collected information and therefore you acknowledge that we are not liable for any third party privacy breach and that our liability for our Service Providers breaches is limited to the amount we are able to receive as indemnification from our Service Providers (legal costs exempted).</span></p>
