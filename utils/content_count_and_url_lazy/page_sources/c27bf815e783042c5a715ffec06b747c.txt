<p dir="ltr"><b id="docs-internal-guid-de03335e-7fff-e477-8935-3463195fad3a">YOUR RIGHTS</b></p>

<p>Having regard to the fact that Project Whitecard processes information concerning you, you may assert certain rights about which we want to inform you in this section. You may assert all the rights in writing at the above-given postal address or by e-mail at privacy@projectwhitecard.com.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.</p>

<p>Additionally, we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Services), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may request, at any time, that all of your user data that has been collected or stored can be deleted by making a request to the email address or mail address under the Contact Us section below.</p>

<p>We only need to process your accurate personal data. You have the right to the rectification of your personal data which are processed incorrectly.</p>

<p>Under any circumstances you have the right to demand that we erase your personal data. However, this is not always possible. If you think that your personal data are no longer needed for the purpose for which they have been processed; if you believe that your personal data are processed by Project Whitecard illegally; or if Project Whitecard process personal data of a child without any parental consent given for such processing, you may demand that we erase your personal data. However, it is not always possible to erase the personal data provided by you for instance because of the fact that if we erased them, you would no longer have access to the Services.</p>

<p>Another right you may assert is the right to data portability based on which we will hand over the personal data provided by you in a commonly used, structured and machine-readable format or if you require, we will transfer them to another controller of your own choice, where such transfer is technically feasible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you believe that your personal data processed by Project Whitecard are incorrect, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data for a period necessary to verify the accuracy of your personal data and to rectify them if needed. You also have this right if the processing of your personal data is illegal but you do not wish for your personal data to be erased; if Project Whitecard no longer needs your personal data for the above-specified processing purposes but you demand that your personal data are preserved for the purposes of the determination, exercise or defence of your legal claims; or if you have objected to the processing of your personal data on the basis of Project Whitecard’s legitimate interest.</p>

<p>With regard to the fact that some of your personal data we process on the basis of our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to this processing. Based on the objection we will consider whether it really is in our interest to process your personal data for the given purpose. If we conclude that we do not have any significant legitimate reasons that prevail over your interests, rights or freedoms, we will terminate the processing of and destroy such personal data. However, it needs to be stressed that such objection should be well-founded. Therefore, we recommend you to firstly obtain all the necessary information at the above-mentioned email address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span>DATA RETENTION</span></strong></p>
