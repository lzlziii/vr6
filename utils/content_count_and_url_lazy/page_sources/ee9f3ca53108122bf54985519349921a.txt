    <h1 id="toc_0">Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>The most private data is the data that is never collected in the first place! That’s why <strong>we aim to collect the minimal data needed</strong> to allow you to play and share in Peco Peco, improve and fix it and to help us market it. We’d rather use anonymous or aggregated data than personal data, as it’s better for you and better for us too.</p>

    <p><strong>Download logs:</strong> we log the server side downloads of the game data and assets. For example when a player launches the game, the game will download an updated version of the models and puzzle cuts databases using a link to our server. If the player downloads a model, it will also use a link to our server. Each download only logs the URL for the resource downloaded, the time and the IP address asking the resource. If your IP address is unique, and can be uniquely attributed to you, it can be considered as unique personal data (if your IP address is shared with many people, or is changing all the time, we have no way of using it as a personal identifier on our part).</p>

    <p><strong>Anonymous gameplay data:</strong> This is data on which puzzles are solved and in what time. We use it to help improve the game and resolve bugs. No personal data (for example no e-mail address, no IP address or no Oculus or device ID) is attached to these gameplay analytics.</p>

    <p>We aim to share this anonymous and aggregated gameplay data with the players and the Peco Peco community to give everybody a better sense of what seems fun to play, to give puzzle cutters and creators feedback on their creations, to give players a way to compare themselves to others if they want.</p>

    <p><strong>Store platforms:</strong> Your personal data are also processed by the platforms through which you have purchased our game: Oculus, Itch. </p>

    <p>They collect their own data when you use them, and share some data with us through their respective dashboards. The store platforms are generally sharing the minimum necessary information about buyers with us for billing and support purposes. If you use one of these platforms, please also refer to their own privacy policies. </p>

    <p><strong>No ID at the moment:</strong> We are not using any username or user ID at the moment. Future versions of the game may use an username or an user ID to enable features like sharing custom puzzles with your friends. If and when those features are added, this privacy policy will be updated to reflect that.</p>

    <p><strong>GDPR:</strong> Users from all regions benefit from all the legal rights given by the European Union General Data Protection Regulation: Right to data portability, Right to restriction of processing, Right to object to processing on the basis of legitimate interest. If you believe you need to exercise one of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@benth.am">team@benth.am</a> and we will gladly help. </p>

    <p><strong>Right to deletion of your personal data</strong>
        Users from all regions are able to exercise their right to deletion of their personal data. If you believe you need to exercise this right, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@benth.am">team@benth.am</a> and we will gladly help. </p>

    <p><strong>Changes:</strong> We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
