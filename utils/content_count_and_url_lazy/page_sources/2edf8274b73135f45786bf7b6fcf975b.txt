3. What kind of personal data about me are you collecting and why?
3.1. So that you can play Bayou Beach XR and we are able to repair and improve the game, we collect the following data about you:

technical data (data about your device etc.);
data concerning your use of Bayou Beach XR (when and how and how successfully you play the game).

to enable the functioning of Bayou Beach XR and
to create statistics contributing to the improvement of the game.
3.2. Firstly, we need your personal data described above (identification data, technical data and game use data) so that the game is functional, including leaderboards etc. The reason for such processing is based on the necessity to fulfil the agreement between you and us.
3.3. Some of your personal data we need to process for our statistical purposes. These include either purely technical data (i.e. information not containing any personal data at all) or the other above-described data in pseudonymized form, that is, highly confidential data to which we assign a special number so that nobody except for us is able to match the data to the existing identifier using the given number. This processing is based on our legitimate interest which is the continuous improvement of the game. You have the right to object to this processing in the manner described below.
4. How will you process my personal data?
4.1. With regard to the above-mentioned purposes, it is apparent that we do not need your personal data in a form that enables your identification.

5. Do you need my consent for the processing?

Art. 8.2.) or until you ensure complete erasure of Bayou Beach XR from your library on any given platform . However, most of the data is kept in the aggregate form only (when you cannot be identified) and only for as long as necessary.
7. Do I have to give my personal data to you? Do you have to process them?
7.1. If you want to play Bayou Beach XR, we need the said personal data so that we can enable you to play. Unfortunately, this is not possible without your personal data.
8. To whom do you transfer my personal data?
8.1. We have the personal data in our possession for the whole time. To some partners, we only provide aggregated statistics (not personal data).
