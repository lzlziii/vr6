<p style="font-size: 120%">Thank you for being in <a href="../">Anyland</a>!</p>


<h2><a name="etiquette"></a>What's the Anyland behavior etiquette?</h2> 
 
<p>Anyland is proud to have people from all walks of life and all colors of the rainbow. Respect is one of our building blocks. We strive for a peaceful environment for everyone.</p> 

<p>If you use the context laser (top Vive controller button on the thumb side) on people or things, you'll find options such as friending or reporting. You can also lock people out of your area if you want to.</p>
  
<p>When interacting with others, please be respectful. For instance, cursing at them or otherwise showing hate against them, is against the etiquette. Impersonation or multiple accounts to confuse, deceptive creations outside of voluntary challenges, bullying, strong rudeness in speech or drawings, trolling, spamming, picking of fights, personal attacks, spreading rumors about someone, overly aggressive behavior towards others, homophobia, and racism aren't wanted by most and are against the etiquette. You may not reserve area names for future use, or mass create new areas, as everyone should get a chance at the names. 
Please do not publicize videos or screenshots of Anyland with the intention to embarass or ridicule the person being filmed 
(depending on context, you can also let others know you're recording... the more it's not a group situation, the more expectation one would have to privacy). 
</p> 
 
<p>Often, location matters: what people may consider offensive in one area may be accepted, funny and terrific in another more distant location with another group. Try to apply common sense and find the group and location that's right for you and enjoy! Communication and flagging is the basis for how we all self-maintain.</p> 

<p>Please read the terms below for more.</p> 
 
 
<h2><a name="terms"></a>What are the terms of service?</h2> 
 
<p>We try to keep the terms text short :)</p> 
 
<p><strong>First of all, we take our responsibility very seriously, and 
want to provide a long-term sustainable environment for everyone who joined.</strong> If you join Anyland, you agree to all of these terms of service.</p> 
 
<p>Anyland requires you to be at least 13 years old. Also, if you are 13 years old but less than 18 years, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has consented to your having an Anyland account and using Anyland, and that your parent/ guardian has read &amp; accepted the terms on your behalf. If you're 13+ but below 18 you also agree that you will behave appropriately mature for the groups you're with and leave situations that would be inappropriate for you.</p> 
 
<p>We try to have the world be stable &amp; permanent and have backups and such... but can make no guarantees regarding lost data or availablility of the service. We may block users who we find abuse the service, and cancel, remove or block accounts, creations or areas if they go against the etiquette or terms. 
</p> 
 
<p><strong>We want the best for Anyland and its citizens</strong>, and to that end reserve the right to amend the world and its rules in any ways we think helps create the best place for all citizens.</p> 
 
<p><strong>By submitting content in Anyland you affirm that you have the necessary licenses, rights, trademarks etc. on that content</strong> 
and that you give Anyland the universe-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right to do anything with it for all time, and 
to give all Anyzens the universe-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free rights to access this content 
(community happiness is our <em>top</em> priority to which all other decisions follow). 
Otherwise you are not allowed to use trademarked properties (including in created area names) or copy work. (Non-terms sidenote: We personally wish the world would switch to movements like Creative Commons and vastly broaden Fair Use and remixing defense in everyday creative situations.) Please note we will process and investigate all notices of alleged infringements and take appropriate actions as part of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA), notifications of claims and counter-notifications should be sent <a href="copyright.html">in this form</a>. 
It is against the terms to embed, share, upload, create or communicate content which is against the law. 
</p> 
 
<p>If you're not an adult or you don't know if someone else is an adult, don't ask for or provide personal information like address, email, web page, phone number and such. By logging in to Anyland you agree to all of the terms, which may change in the future. You also agree to keep to our etiquette. You agree not to create highly offensive things in the world meant to disturb others through shock and similar.
You agree to keep the <a href="#etiquette">etiquette</a> and <a href="#forumEtiquette">forum etiquette</a> in all your actions and content. 
If you are under the age of majority where you live (i.e. you are not legally an adult yet) you represent that your parent or legal guardian has also reviewed and agreed to these terms. 
And Anyland account must be self-managed in communication with us.
We are trying to focus on world health and happiness for all of us. We reserve the right to delete any account and creations at our discretion, and there are automatic blocks based on certain patterns. Automation, redistribution or wrapping of Anyland and its components, or interfacing with them outside of the ones provided, is against the terms; please talk to us for case by case exceptions as we're pondering a future API to open up use cases such as importing (and ensure file size is kept to a minimum in your tries).
Please note we may set limits to cap things (like how many areas one can create and so on).
If you discover a security vulnerability or any type of bug that can be abused, it's against the terms to keep using the bug, but please just let us know about it via email, it's very much appreciated. It's against the terms to submit untrue or nonsensical flag reports. 
</p> 

<p>Using ways to confuse your profile UI so that it can lead to functionality misunderstanding or complication, e.g. by covering the report flag button, is against the terms.</p>

<p>Don't use any mod features which may risk the happiness of others (e.g. cloning unclonable creations), the stability of servers (e.g. by increasing file size that will cause storage problems), or otherwise cause problems. Thanks!

</p><p>Legal info - Termination: Anyland does not guarantee that it will continue to offer access to the system and services or support the app. Anyland may in its sole discretion cease to provide any or all of the services offered in connection with Anyland (including access to the system and any or all features or components of the app), terminate the EULA, close all accounts and cancel all of the rights granted to you under the EULA. Anyland may communicate such termination to you upon 30 days' notice in any of the following manners: 1) when you log into your account; 2) in a notice on Anyland website; 3) via email; or 4) in another manner that Anyland deems suitable to inform you of the termination. If Anyland terminates the EULA pursuant to this section, you will not receive a refund of any fees.</p> 
 
<p>Legal info - Account termination: Anyland may immediately, and without notice, discontinue or suspend access to the system through your account, and close your account, if we find a violations of the terms. You will not be entitled to receive a refund of fees for a termination pursuant to this section.</p> 
 
<p><a name="availability" id="availability"></a>[Please note: Our goal is to offer the Anyland service for as long as it's possible. It's our labor of love and we are very dedicated to it. What if the servers go down though, or we can't pay the costs of running anymore? What if anything else happens that makes it difficult for us to continue the service? We may then one day consider other additional ways to cover costs to ensure the stability for all of you, or even restrict (or worst case, stop) the service. We hope this won't ever happen, but wanted to put in this cautionary note in any case... we hope you understand!]</p>
 
<p>If you are ever locked and you don't know why, or there's another account-related issue, please feel free to <a href="mailto:we@anyland.com">contact us</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Multiple accounts are not allowed if one of the accounts is banned, has over 5 flag reports, or shows a warning.</p>

<p><strong>We will do our best to provide a great environment for all of you!</strong></p>
  

<h2><a name="forumEtiquette"></a>What's the Anyland forum etiquette?</h2> 

<p>The etiquette and terms for forums follow above etiquette and terms – for instance, to always be respectful. 
In addition:</p> 

<ul> 
<li><p>Please use self-descriptive titles. For instance, the title "Suggestion: Feedable Pets" would be used instead of just "Suggestion".</p></li> 

<li><p>It is against the etiquette to post issues specifically related to an account, or one person, on general forums (or really, any other public place). Account-related issues need to be either discussed in person, or if that's not possible, discussed in private with us via email. This helps the privacy of all involved.</p></li> 

<li><p>Please do not share any personal details of others on the board, including their location, their activities, their hobbies, profession, what they do or don't do, what they told you in chat etc. Please do not represent or quote others, but allow them to speak for themselves. Please do not post photos of others. Please do not share what you found out about others on the web or elsewhere. Again, privacy is important.</p></li> 

<li><p>Complaints about other Anyzens should be written in Flag reports, but not a forum. In addition, you can contact us via email for such issues.</p></li> 

<li><p>Please do not bump your own threads (e.g. adding a follow-up to them if they didn't yet yield a reply). Please contact us via email if you feel something needs to be looked at again.</p></li> 

<li><p>If a thread was closed, please do not reopen it under a new title (you can contact us via email if you want to know more about the reasons).</p></li> 

<li><p>Please do not post very personal information about yourself, like your home address, email address, or phone number on a forum.</p></li> 

<li><p> 
Threads posted should be appropriate for the topic of the board, and comments posted should be appropriate for the subject of the thread posted in. On boards with high posting frequency and a bigger audience, please keep comment and thread relevancy high, the message clear, and posting quantity and frequency in proportion.</p></li> 
</ul> 

<p>A big thanks to everyone who participates in forums!</p> 


<h2><a name="medical"></a>Medical notes</h2> 

<p>Please try not to sleep with your headset on as it can hurt your eyes, and keep to all other Vive security instructions. Be safe!</p>

<p>Anyland is a sandbox universe with unpredictable creations and areas. There may be flashing lights and similar triggering effects created by people at any time.
</p>

<h3><a name="photosensitive"></a>Photosensitive warning</h3> 
 
<div style="font-style: italic">
<p>A very small percentage of individuals may experience epileptic seizures when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights.
Exposure to certain patterns or backgrounds on a computer screen, or while playing games, may induce an epileptic seizure in these individuals.
Certain conditions may induce previously undetected epileptic symptoms even in persons who have no history of prior seizures or epilepsy.</p>

<p>If you, or anyone in your family, have an epileptic condition, consult your physician prior to using Anyland. If you experience any of
the following symptoms while playing a video or game – dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation,
any involuntary movement, or convulsions – immediately discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming.</p>


</div>


<h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Your privacy is very important to us, it's what makes for a comfy experience.</p>

<p>What you speak is never persistently saved with us, it's just transmitted (through a cloud service called Photon).
Web pages which you visit when no one's around, or which are attached to you,
are never transmitted to our servers (and even if others around, they're just transmitted temporarily for the syncing need so others
see the same surface display).</p>
<p></p>

<p>To keep your chat privacy guarded, we take a variety of measures:</p>

<ul>
<li>People can't turn fully invisible around you (unless the area explicitly allows it, at which point you will get
a security message informing you of it)</li>
<li>When people shrink to very small sizes in an area, you will get an alert dialog of that</li>
<li>In your Me → "..." settings, you can tick "Unfindable", which means others (even if they friended you)
can't see your current area. This option will also hide your name from <a href="http://in.anyland.com">in.anyland.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The Anyland.com website uses Google Analytics as statistics software, which may add cookies.
</p>

<p>Anyland is self-maintainted by all of us. When someone writes a flag report, this report is private only for the Anyland devs to see.
</p>

<p>When you want most privacy, you can set your area to be private. When that happens, only other editors (or temporarily for some minutes, the people you decide to ping)
can join the area and speak with you. To set your area private, choose the area mountain &amp; sun icon → "..." → Private.
</p>

<p>Objects you create and publicly place (and which are still placed somewhere) may appear in universal searches.
To avoid that, you can context-laser a creation and select Tags → Unlisted.
</p>

<p>To fully disable your microphone in Anyland from transmitting anything, use Me → Microphone → Mute Me.
</p>
