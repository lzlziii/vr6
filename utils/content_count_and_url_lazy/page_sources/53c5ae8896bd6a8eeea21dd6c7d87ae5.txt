websites, <a href="https://www.altavr.io">https://www.altavr.io</a>, <a href="https://townshiptale.com">https://townshiptale.com</a>, and the subdomains of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "Website") and the A Township Tale® video game (the "Game" and, with the Website, the "Services").</p><p>This Policy sets forth how we collect, use, protect, store, and otherwise process your Personal Information (defined below). This Policy does NOT apply to information we collect offline or you provide to or is collected by any third party (except as otherwise provided below).</p><p>For our practices regarding children, please see the Children's section in Section 2 below.</p><h2>1. What types of Personal Information does the Company collect?</h2><h3>Generally</h3><p>We may collect different types of information from you depending on how you use our Services, including Personal Information. "Personal Information" means information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The categories of Personal Information we may collect are listed below. Certain types of Personal Information may fall under more than one category.</p><ul><li>Identifiers: We may collect your first, middle and last name, email address, username, postal address, IP address or display name.</li><li>Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law: We may collect your date of birth or age.</li><li>Commercial information: We may collect your sale history in the Game.</li><li>Sensory data: We may receive your voice through your microphone and animation data derived from your head movement and hand movement. We do not store this information.</li><li>Internet or other similar network activity: We may collect your play history, running/loaded dynamic link library ("DLLs") on your computer or data gathered from a "small memory dump."</li><li>Categories of personal information described in Section 1798.80(e) of the California Customer Records: We may collect your first, middle, and last name, telephone number, physical characteristics, signature, Social Security number, postal address, or account number.</li><li>Other categories: We may collect information from the content that you create and share publicly in the Game, and information you choose to reveal in the Game through multiplayer chat or other public functions.</li></ul><p>We may also collect information that does not generally identify you but may become associated with your account. We may use information that does not identify you for any permissible business purpose under applicable law.</p><h2>2. Children Under the Age of 13</h2><p>This section notifies parents of our practices with respect to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 ("Children" and each a "Child") and the use and disclosure of such information. This section only applies to Children and supplements the other provisions of this Policy.</p><h3>Junior Mode</h3><p>If a user of the Game self-identifies or is identified by us as being under the age of 13, their gameplay experience will automatically be set as "Junior Mode." In order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, "COPPA"), users in "Junior Mode" ("Junior Users" and each a "Junior User") may have access to fewer features of the Game than non-Junior Users. This is designed to limit our access and the access of users of the Services to the Personal Information of Children. Junior Users are restricted from communicating with or otherwise making their Personal Information publicly available to other users of the Services. For example, Junior Users are unable to use "whiteboarding" or voice communication functions of the Game, and Junior Users' display names will be randomized/anonymized.</p><h3>Registration</h3><p>Junior Users may register an account with us using a registration process similar to the one adults go through; however, in compliance with COPPA, Junior Users may first be subject to a parental notice and/or consent process prior to activation of their account. To initiate the registration and/or consent process for a Junior User, we collect a Parent's email address, and the Parent is then requested to create a password for their Child's account, as well as supply additional account information and settings. We will automatically generate randomized display names for registered Junior Users.</p><h3>Use/disclosure</h3><p>The Personal Information we collect from/about Children is used to give Children access to certain features of the Game and communicate with a Parent about the Child's registration, including for the purpose of verifying their Child's information in connection with registration. We do not share or otherwise disclose Children's Personal Information except (1) as may be necessary to protect the safety of a Child, including by disclosing his or her Personal Information, where appropriate, to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety; (2) to enable us to take precautions against liability; (3) to protect the safety and security of the Services; or (4) where required to do so by law or legal process.</p><p>We and the third-party service providers listed below may collect or maintain Children's Personal Information through the Services.</p><ul><li>Amazon AWS</li><li>Google Analytics</li><li>Xsolla</li></ul><p>Please contact us with questions about our service providers' privacy policies and collection and use practices by mail at Alta Reality Pty Ltd, 100 George st, Parramatta, NSW 2150, by email at <a href="mailto:contact@altavr.io">contact@altavr.io</a>, or by phone at (061) 466 824 649.</p><p>At any time, parents may review their Child's Personal Information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete such Personal Information, request that we delete their Child's account, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the Child's Personal Information by contacting us using the email address provided above. To protect parents' privacy and security and the privacy and security of Children that use the Services, we may require parents to take certain steps or provide additional information, which we will keep strictly confidential, to verify a parent's identity before we provide any information or make corrections.</p><h2>3. From what sources does the Company collect Personal Information?</h2><h3>Directly From You</h3><ul><li>We may collect your Personal Information when you provide it to us directly.
