<p></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information.</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong></p>
<p>Communications between you and Us. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account
verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may
not opt-out of Service-related emails.</p>
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools
collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and
other
information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with
analytics information from other Users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular
individual User.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local
storage to collect information about how you use the Service and provide features to you.</p>
<p>We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or
similar technologies placed by us or the third party.</p>
<p><strong>Logfile</strong><strong> information:</strong></p>
<p>Logfile information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e.,
visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the web page or app is downloaded to
your browser or device.</p>
<p>When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web
request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks,
and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such
information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track

reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>

<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor,
store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small
data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely
identify
your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data
stored
in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by the
Application.</p>
<p>A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third-party partner about how you browse and use
the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the
Service may not function properly if the use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
</p>
<p><strong>Metadata:</strong></p>
<p>Metadata is usually technical data that is associated with User Content. For example, Metadata can describe
how, when, and by whom a piece of User Content was collected and how that content is formatted.</p>
<p>Users can add or may have Metadata added to their User Content including a hashtag (e.g., to mark keywords
when you post a photo), geotag (e.g., to mark your location to a photo), comments, or other data. This makes
your User Content more searchable by others and more interactive. If you geo-tag your photo or tag your
photo
using other's APIs then, your latitude and longitude will be stored with the photo and searchable (e.g.,
through a location or map feature) if your photo is made public by you in accordance with your privacy
settings.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Parties with whom we may share your information:</strong></p>
<p>We may share User Content and your information(including but not limited to, information from cookies, log

group of companies that we are part of, or that become part of that group. Affiliates may use this
information
to help provide, understand, and improve the Service (including by providing analytics) and Affiliates' own

identifiers, and location data, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you. Our
Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service

order, or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include

belief
that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is

activity;
