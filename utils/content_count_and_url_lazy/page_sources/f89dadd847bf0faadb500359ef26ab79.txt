            This privacy policy sets forth our policy about what information we collect from

            Under applicable law, Broken Compass Studio, Inc. is the “data controller” of personal data collected 
            through the Services.
            Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our practices regarding the collection and treatment 
            of your information. Do not use the Services unless you consent to our collection, maintenance and use of your

            We may collect some personal information from you in accordance with this privacy policy

            postal address, email address, telephone number, voice, social security number, IP address, “personal data” 
            (as that term is defined Article 4(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation), other identifiers by which 
            you may be contacted online or offline, and other similar types of information under applicable law. Additionally, 
            “Personal information” may include some non-personal information when it is linked with other types of personal 
            information or non-personal information (e.g., motion sensor information or motion tracker information).

            the third-party platform that you use to access the Game is subject to the applicable third-party terms 
            of use and/or privacy policy (for more information, please see the Oculus Privacy Policy, Steam Privacy 
            Policy Agreement and/or Playstation.com Privacy Policy, as applicable). For instance, when you first play 
            the Game using Playstation VR, information associated with your Playstation Network account 
            (including your PSN Online ID) will automatically be transmitted to us, with no action on your part.  
            Our use of your personal information collected through the Game is limited to the purposes described in 
            the “How We Use Your Information” section below.<br>

            Revealing personal information through the Game.

            If you include personal information in your display name, you are doing so at your own risk.  
            We cannot control how other users will use personal information that you reveal in your display name.  
            If you reveal personal information through your display name, you are doing so at your own risk <br>
