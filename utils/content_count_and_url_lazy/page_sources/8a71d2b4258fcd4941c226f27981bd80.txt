This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p><p><em>Right to Know and Data Portability</em></p><p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past twelve (12) months (the "right to know"). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete below), we will disclose to you:</p><p>·	The categories of personal information we collected about you.</p><p>·	The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</p><p>·	Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</p><p>·	The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</p><p>·	If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</p><p>o	sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and </p><p>o	disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained. </p><p>o	the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</p><p><strong><em>Right to Delete </em></strong></p><p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions (the "right to delete"). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete), we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: </p><p>1. &nbsp;	Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</p><p>2. &nbsp;	Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</p><p>3. &nbsp;	Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</p><p>4. &nbsp;	Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</p><p>5. &nbsp;	Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.).</p><p>6. &nbsp;	Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</p><p>7. &nbsp;	Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</p><p>8. &nbsp;	Comply with a legal obligation.</p><p>9. &nbsp;	Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</p><p>We will delete or deidentify personal information not subject to one of these exceptions from our records and will direct our service providers to take similar action. </p><p><strong><em>Exercising Your Rights to Know or Delete</em></strong></p><p>To exercise your rights to know or delete described above, please submit a request by contacting us using the Website contact form. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know or delete related to your personal information. </p><p>You may only submit a request to know twice within a twelve (12) month period. Your request to know or delete must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. The requesting party must also describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</p><p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. </p><p>We will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make it. </p><p><strong><em>Response Timing and Format</em></strong></p><p>We will confirm receipt of your request as soon as commercially possible, but please note that you may not receive immediate confirmation. </p><p>Our goal is provide a substantive response to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to another forty-five (45) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. </p><p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding our receipt of your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p><p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. </p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p></div></div><div class="column-13 w-col w-col-6 w-col-stack"><div class="rich-text-block-4 w-richtext"><p><strong><em>Non-Discrimination</em></strong></p><p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.
