    </p>

    <h4>e) Profiling</h4>

    <p>
        Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to
        evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict aspects
        concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,
        interests, reliability, behavior, location or movements.

        or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of
        personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the
        controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.
    </p>

    <h4>g) Processor</h4>

        recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable
        data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.
    </p>

    <h4>i) Third party</h4>

    <h3>4. Legal Basis for Processing of Your Data</h3>

    <p>
        If the legal basis is not listed in the Privacy Policy, the following applies:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Insofar as the data subject provides consent for processing, Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR is the
            legal basis;
        </li>
        <li>
            In case of processing of personal data necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, the legal basis is
            Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b) GDPR;
        </li>
        <li>
            Insofar as processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, the legal
            basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. c) GDPR;
        </li>
        <li>
            In the event that vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person require a processing of
            personal data, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. d) GDPR;
        </li>
        <li>
            If processing is necessary to safeguard legitimate interests of our company or of a third party and if the
            interests, basic rights, and basic freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh these legitimate interests,
            the legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Retention periods</h3>

    <p>
        The data processed by Sedo GmbH or Sedo.com LLC is erased or its processing is restricted in compliance with
        statutory requirements, in particular Art. 17 and 18 GDPR. Unless expressly stated otherwise within the scope
        of this Privacy Policy, Sedo GmbH or Sedo.com LLC erase stored data as soon as such is no longer required for
        the intended purpose. Data will be retained beyond the time at which the purpose ends only if such data is
        necessary for other, legally permissible purposes or if the data must continue to be retained due to statutory
        retention periods. In these cases, processing is restricted, i.e. it is blocked, and will not be processed for
        other purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Server log data</h3>

    <p>
        The website collects a series of general data and information when a data subject (user) or automated system

    </p>

    <h2>B. Cookies</h2>

    <p>
        This website uses cookies, which are small text files that, within the scope of your visit to this website, are
        transmitted to your browser and are stored by your browser on your computer for later retrieval. You yourself
        can determine, through settings in your browser, the extent to which cookies can be placed and retrieved. If the
        data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of the website
        may be entirely usable.<br>

        Cookies are used to make the website more user-friendly (so-called "Necessary Cookie"). Without the use of these
        cookies, the number of unique users on the website cannot be determined, or provide you with certain functions.
        In addition, cookies are also used for the website presence, which, for example, allows surfing behavior to be
        analyzed. If cookies are used beyond this, they are expressly mentioned below.<br>

        Legal basis for the use of cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR unless specified otherwise.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Google AdSense for Domains</h3>

    <p>
        This website has integrated Google AdSense for Domains. Google AdSense for Domains is an online service which
        allows the placement of advertising on third-party sites. Google AdSense for Domains (AFD) is an online service
        that allows the placement of advertising on third party websites. Google AdSense for Domains is based on an
        algorithm that selects advertising links on the parked page so that they match the domain name of the respective
        parked website. Google AdSense for Domains (AFD) thus enables a semantic search result.
        <br>

        The operating company of the AdSense component of Google is Alphabet Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain
        View, CA 94043-1351, USA.
        <br>

        The purpose of the AdSense component is to integrate advertisements or advertising links on the parked websites.
        <br>

        When a user calls up a parked page, a request is sent to the AFD service. Google processes the domain name
        requested by the user and dynamically returns targeted ads ("sponsored listings"), keywords ("related links")
        and other page elements, collectively referred to as "AFD results".
        <br>

        The first page that the user sees after requesting a parked page is called the "landing page". The landing page
        may contain related links and/or a search box provided by Google ("Google Search Box"). When a user clicks on a
        related link or performs a search query through the Google Search Box, that user will be directed to a
        "results page" that will display a new group of AFD results relevant to the related link or search term. When
        a user clicks on a sponsored list on the results page, that user will be directed to the ad landing page.
        <br>

        Google AdSense for Domains places a cookie on the individual's information technology system. By setting the
        cookie, it is possible to show the correct display of content on the parked website. Each time the data subject
        accesses one of the individual pages of this website operated by the data controller and on which a Google
        AdSense component has been integrated, the internet browser on the data subject's information technology system
        is automatically prompted by the respective Google AdSense component to transmit data to Alphabet Inc. for the
        purposes of online advertising and the billing of commissions. As part of this technical process, Google obtains
        knowledge of the IP address of the person concerned in order to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and
        subsequently to generate commission statements.
        <br>

        You can prevent the installation of Google AdSense for domains cookies by adjusting your browser software
        accordingly, in particular by suppressing third-party cookies, and thus prevent the setting of cookies. In
        addition, you can prevent the setting of cookies by permanently disabling Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google
        Chrome in your browsers under the link
        <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</a>.
        Please note that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this offer in full.
        <br>

        For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing, as well as further
        information about your rights and settings to protect your privacy, please contact Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheater
        Parkway, Mountainview, California 94043, USA; Privacy Policy for Partner Sites:

    </p>
    <p>
        This processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 paragraph 1 sentence 1 lit. f) of the
        GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our Internet presence.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Conversion Tracking Pixel</h3>

    <p>
        On some parked domains the visitor action pixel of the following providers is used for conversion measurement:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”);
        </li>
        <li>
            Taboola Inc., 16 Madison Square West, 7th fl., New York 10010, USA (“Taboola”);
        </li>
        <li>
            Outbrain UK Limited, 5 New Bridge Street, London, EC4V 6JA, UK (“Outbrain”);
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Snap Inc., 63 market Street, Venice, CA 90291, USA (“Snapchat”);
        </li>
        <li>
            Oath (EMEA) Limited 5-7 Point Square, North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland (“Yahoo Gemini”);
        </li>
        <li>
            TikTok Inc., 10100 Venice Blvd., Culver City, CA 90232, USA (“TikTok”);
        </li>
        <li>
            Pinterest Europe Ltd., Palmerston House 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Pinterest”); <br>
            <br>
            (hereinafter jointly referred to as the “Provider”).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By setting the conversion tracking pixel, the behavior of users can be tracked after they have been redirected
        to the target page by clicking on an advertisement. This procedure is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
        Provider advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and can help to optimize future advertising
        measures.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data collected does not allow us to draw any conclusions about the identity of users. However, the data is
        stored and processed by the respective Provider so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible
        and the respective Provider can use the data for its own advertising purposes in accordance with its own data
        protection guidelines. This allows the Provider to enable advertisements to be placed on their website and
        outside their website. This use of the data cannot be influenced by us as a website operator.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will find further information on the protection of your privacy as well as the possibility of revoking your
        consent in the data protection notes of the respective Providers:

        The use of visitor action pixels is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR. As a website operator, there is
        a legitimate interest in effective advertising measures, including social media, in order to optimize both our
        advertising offer and our interest-oriented design of our online offer.

    <h3>3. Content Delivery Networks (CDN)</h3>

    <p>
        We use Content Delivery Network on our pages from CacheNetworks, LLC, 111 W. Jackson Blvd. suite 160, Chicago,
        Illinois 60604, USA ("Cachefly").
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purpose of a shorter loading time of our online presence, we use a so-called Content Delivery Network
        ("CDN"), in which the website is delivered via web servers from Cachefly as a service provider based on a data
        processing agreement. With the CDN, content from our website such as images, fonts, stylesheets and scripts are
        delivered to you faster via a network of servers. For this purpose, the browser you are using must connect to
        Cachefly's servers. This way Cachefly becomes aware that your IP address, along with any other information that
        your browser may reveal, has been used to access our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data collected will only be used for the aforementioned purpose and to maintain the functionality and
        security of the CDN.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further information can be found in Cachefly's privacy policy:
        <a href="https://www.cachefly.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">https://www.cachefly.com/privacy-policy/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The use of the CDN serves to protect our predominantly legitimate interests within the scope of a weighing of
        interests according to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f) GDPR in a secure provision and optimization of the online
        offer.
