Privacy Policy<br><br>
Date of Last Revision: 12/15/2015<br><br>
Our Policy:<br><br>
Wevr, Inc., Inc. ("Wevr, Inc.", "we", "us", or "our") provides our websites located at www. wevr.com, www.transportvr.com, and other websites which post this policy (collectively, the "Site"), all related services and products, including but not limited to, the "Wevr Transport" software and mobile applications, and their related services (collectively, the Site, the software, mobile applications, and such services, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy has been created to provide information about our company and the Service to you and sets forth Wevr, Inc.'s policy with respect to information (including personally identifiable information ("PII" or "Personal Identifying Information") and other information) that is collected from visitors to the Site and users of the Service.<br><br>
By submitting PII through the Site or the Service, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your PII may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of PII may be less stringent than the laws in your country.<br><br>
What information do we collect?<br><br>
When you interact with us through the Service, we may collect Personal Identifying Information as well as other information from you, as further described below:<br><br>
* We collect Personal Identifying Information that you provide through the Service:&nbsp;We collect Personal Identifying Information from you when you voluntarily provide such information as follows:<br><br>
* When you register for access to the Service, we collect the information you provide during the registration process.<br><br>
* When you register or add Facebook or another third party service (each a "Third Party Service") account to the Service, we will collect your login information and other relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third Party Service and your data contained within that Third Party Service.<br><br>
* If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on the Site), we collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume.<br><br>
* When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. <br><br>
* We also collect other types of Personal Identifying Information that you provide to us voluntarily.<br><br>
* Our payment provider collects payment information: We use the payment services of Stripe (https://stripe.com) for online payments and/or Automated Clearing House (ACH) payouts. We do not process, record or maintain your credit card or bank account information.&nbsp; For more information on how payments are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy afforded such information, please refer to&nbsp;https://stripe.com/us/privacy.<br><br>
* The Service collects data via technology:&nbsp;To make our Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect Personal Identifying Information from you, including internet protocol address, geographic location, operating system, browser type, domain name, and a date/time stamp for your visit. We also use cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Identifying Information and store it in log files each time you visit the Site or access your account on our network. <br><br>
* Cookies collect data:&nbsp;In operating the Service, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts the Service gives to your browser when you access the Service. Our cookies help provide a more personal and interactive experience on the Service and help us analyze Service usage more accurately. For instance, the Service may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Service without needing to enter a password more than once during a visit to the Service. <br><br>
* Do Not Track Signals: We do not currently respond to "do not track" signals from web browsers.
How do we use your Personal Identifying Information and other information?<br><br>
* Wevr, Inc. uses your Personal Identifying Information in the following ways: <br><br>
* to provide you with the Service; <br><br>
* to personalize and better tailor the features, performance and support of the Service for your use;<br><br>
* to send you administrative notifications, such as security or support and maintenance advisories; <br><br>
* to respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests; <br><br>
* to send you newsletters, surveys, offers or other information if you opt-in to receiving such information; <br><br>
* to provide you with opportunities and functionality that we think would be of particular interest to you; <br><br>
* to improve the quality of the Site and the Service, <br><br>
* to analyze, benchmark and conduct research on, user data and user interactions with the Service; <br><br>
* to conduct market research, planning, troubleshooting, and problem-solving, and to detect and protect against error, fraud, or other criminal activity; and<br><br>
* to solicit your feedback.<br><br>
If you provide Personal Identifying Information for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Identifying Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Identifying Information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.<br><br>
* We may create "Anonymous Data" records from Personal Identifying Information by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you. Such Anonymous Data cannot be used to specifically identify you. Wevr, Inc. may store such Anonymous Data itself or such Anonymous Data may be included in databases owned and maintained by Wevr, Inc. affiliates, agents or service providers. The Service may use such Anonymous Data and pool it with other information to track, for example, information about the total number of visitors to the Site, the number of users of the Service, the domain names of our visitors' or users' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Service. We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve site navigation. Wevr, Inc. reserves the right, in its discretion, to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third party companies for their own business purposes.<br><br>
* Wevr, Inc. and its subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (collectively, "Wevr, Inc. Companies") may also use your Personal Identifying Information and Anonymous Data collected through the Service to help us customize the Service or the messages you receive, improve the content and functionality of the Service, to better understand our users and to improve the Service. In all cases, we will require our Wevr, Inc. Companies to honor this Privacy Policy. <br><br>
If Wevr, Inc. intends on using any Personal Identifying Information in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Identifying Information is collected.<br><br>
When do we disclose your Personal Identifying Information and other information?<br><br>
Wevr, Inc. is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Identifying Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:<br><br>
* Third Party Services:&nbsp;Some of our Services may enable you to post content to Third Party Services (e.g., Facebook).&nbsp; If you choose to do this, we will provide information to the Third Party Service in accordance with your elections.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those services and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the Third Party Service.&nbsp; We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such Third Party Services; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such Third Party Services; or (iii) your use of any such Third Party Services.<br><br>
* Corporate Restructuring:&nbsp; We may share some or all of your Personal Identifying Information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets. In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Identifying Information may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Identifying Information collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Identifying Information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
* Wevr, Inc. Companies (e.g. our subsidiaries and affiliates):&nbsp;We may also share your Personal Identifying Information with the Wevr, Inc. Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
* Third Party Service Providers:&nbsp;Wevr, Inc., like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies ("Third Party Service Providers") to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. We may share your Personal Identifying Information with our Third Party Service Providers.<br><br>
* Legal Requirements:&nbsp;Wevr, Inc. may disclose your Personal Identifying Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Wevr, Inc., (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.<br><br>
What are your choices?<br><br>
* General: You may request that we edit Personal Identifying Information in your account by emailing support@wevr.com. You may request that we delete your account, and any information associated with your account, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to retain this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). We may also retain your information for fraud or similar purposes. When we delete your information, it will be deleted from the active database but may remain in our archives.<br><br>
* Promotional Communications: When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to "opt-out" by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Should you decide to opt-out of receiving future mailings, we may share your e-mail address with third parties to ensure that you do not receive further communications from third parties. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you administrative communications, such as notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.<br><br>
* Cookies: The help file directions in your web browser can provide you with information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the Service may not work properly.<br><br>
* Third Party Services: Please refer to the privacy settings of the Third Party Services to determine how you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between your account and such Third Party Services.<br><br>
What about children's information?<br><br>
Wevr, Inc. does not knowingly collect Personal Identifying Information from children under the age of 13. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Identifying Information through the Service without their permission. If a child under 13 submits Personal Identifying Information to us and we learn that the Personal Identifying Information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any Personal Identifying Information from a child under 13, please contact us at support@wevr.com.<br><br>
What if there are links to other websites?<br><br>
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Service. Our provision of a link to any other service, website or location, such as the Amazon Payments, Google Checkout or Paypal payment processing websites or social media and networking services, is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other service, website or location or their contents. When you use such a service or click on such a link, you will leave the Site and go to another website. During this process, another entity may collect Personal Identifying Information or Anonymous Data from you. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every service you use and website you visit. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside services, websites or their content. <br><br>
How does Wevr, Inc. handle security?<br><br>
Wevr, Inc. uses a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Identifying Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Despite these measures, you should know that Wevr, Inc. cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Identifying Information, that mistakes may happen, and that security cannot be ultimately guaranteed.<br><br>
Changes to this Privacy Policy:<br><br>
This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any material changes in the way we use your Personal Identifying Information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by posting notice of the changes on the Site at www.transportvr.com/privacy. For existing users of the Site or the Service, any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of the Site or the Service. Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating your Personal Identifying Information to provide us with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. In any event, changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of Personal Identifying Information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your Personal Identifying Information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us. Continued use of the Site or the Service following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.<br><br>
