Here’s how we do it:<br><br><strong>Information You Give Us Directly</strong><br>‍<br>We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us in the following ways:<br>- When you fill in forms on our website, including when you download our SDK or apply to work with us;&nbsp;<br>- When you sign up to receive communications from us, complete a survey, or register for an event, contest, or giveaway;<br>- When you create a Developer or Seller account on our Sites and populate your profile;<br>- When you email us to ask a question or request customer service;<br>- When you communicate with us via a third-party platform, such as our Twitch channel or through our official Discord;<br>- When you buy something on or through our Services, such as virtual goods or audience-driven, in-game interactions with your favorite content Sellers;<br>- When you post or share user-generated content via our Services, including videos you have created using LIV Software;&nbsp;<br>- When you communicate with us or other LIV users via our Services; and&nbsp;<br>- When you scan your badge or otherwise leave your details with us at an event or trade show.<br>‍<br>The type of personal data we collect in these situations can include your name, company/employer, job title, birth date, gender, time zone/geographical location, email or other contact information, interests, VR experience, biographical information, and photo and video content of your choosing.&nbsp; If you purchase something on or through our Services, we ask that you provide us (or our third-party payment processor) with billing information, such as your payment card information and billing address. Likewise, if you choose to list digital content for sale on our LIV Store, we ask that you provide us (or our third-party payment processor) with certain personal and financial information to allow us to make payments to you. If you talk with our team via chat, email, or telephone or communicate with us or other LIV users through our chat interface or through a third-party social media platform, we may collect the contents of your communications which can include any information you choose to include. Likewise, if you apply to work with us, we will collect any information you choose to share with us in your application and resume.<br>‍<br><strong>Information You Give Us Directly (automatically)</strong><br>‍<br>We collect other information automatically as you navigate our Services. This information can include the following:<br>- Information about the devices you use to access our Services, including the type of device you’re using; your operating system; your browser information; and your VR hardware and VR system, including their settings and components;<br>- Unique identifiers, device IDs, and other identifiers from games, apps, or accounts you use;<br>- Information about the games, content, or other apps installed on your device or provided through our Services, including from third parties;<br>- Location-related information, which we derive from things like your device’s IP address or your mobile device’s GPS signal;<br> -Information about your visit to our Sites, such as the date and time of your visit, the information you searched for to find our Sites, the site you came from, the site you visit when you leave us, and how you used or didn’t use our Services;<br>- Information about your activity on our Services such as “Recording game X for Y time” and “Opened dialog Foo and clicked button Bar”;<br>- Information about your activity on our LIV Store such as items you’ve viewed or added to your wishlist;&nbsp;<br>- Information related to any transactions made through our Services, including the date and time of order, items ordered, and amount charged;&nbsp;<br>- Information related to communications between users on our LIV Store.

For example, we may receive information about the play area that you have defined; and<br>- Errors and crash reports, including basic information about what happened internally leading up to the crash.<br><br>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. LIV uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you are signed in to your account, to provide you with a better user experience, and to analyze and track data relating to how people use our Services. You can disable cookies, limit the types of cookies you allow, or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent. Please refer to the guidance offered by your chosen web browser if you’d like help managing your cookie preferences.<br>‍<br>We also integrate third-party analytics tools into our Services to help us analyze how people use our Services. Third-party analytics companies collect and use information in accordance with their own privacy policies and may combine the information they collect in connection with LIV’s Services with information they have independently collected over time and across websites.&nbsp;<br>‍<br><strong>Information we collect from other sources</strong><br>‍<br>We may receive information about you from other sources including the following third parties:<br><br>Payment Processors: In general, when you purchase something through our Services, your payment card information is provided directly to our third-party payment processor and LIV does not collect or store that information. However, in some circumstances we may receive limited information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits of your card, the country of issuance, and the expiration date.<br>‍<br>Third-Party Platforms: If you create an account on our Sites, we ask you to supply an email address and password. Alternatively, we allow you to sign up by linking your account on third-party platforms&nbsp; such as Twitch, Tiktok, and YouTube. If you choose to log-in using one of these third-party platforms , we may receive your name and email address from that provider. We may also offer social features and other integrated tools within or in connection with our Services which allow you to connect your account on additional third-party platforms such as Facebook, Discord, Twitter, Instagram, or Mixer. If you choose to do so, the provider of that third-party platform may make certain information available to LIV. This can include information necessary to facilitate the integration as well as any additional information the provider chooses to share with LIV or which you have permitted the provider to share through your privacy settings. For instance, Twitch might share a user’s broadcast history with us which we may then store. We encourage you to check the privacy settings and privacy policies of these third-party platforms to understand what information might be shared with us.<br>‍<br>Third-Party Developers: When you play a game or use applications that include the LIV SDK, we may receive certain information about your gameplay or information otherwise necessary to facilitate the integration.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>We may combine the information we collect about you from these various sources.

However, you can configure most browsers to reject cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it.

For some requests, such as changes to billing information or account data deletion, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can process your request.<br>‍<br>Data Requests: Certain privacy laws provide users with rights related to their personal data.

You also may choose not to use social features we make available.<br>‍<br><strong>Children<br><br></strong>Many features of our Services are intended for general audiences and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children in connection with these features. If you are a parent or legal guardian and think your child under the age of 13 (or a higher age threshold where applicable) has given us personal data without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@liv.tv">privacy@liv.tv</a>. <br>If we do intend to collect personal data from children, we will take additional steps to protect children’s privacy, including:<br>‍<br>- Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of personal data we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;<br>- In accordance with applicable law, and our practices, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal data from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children;<br> -Limiting our collection of personal data from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity; and<br>- Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal data we have collected from their children and the ability to request that the personal data be changed or deleted.<br><br><strong>Links to Other&nbsp;Websites and Third-Party Consent<br><br></strong>We may provide links to third-party websites, services, and applications that are not operated or controlled by LIV. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of those third parties. The fact that we link to a website, service, or application is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party service before providing any personal data to or through them.<br>‍<br><strong>YouTube Integration</strong><br><br>The following applies if you use the YouTube Live API integration (the “YouTube Integration”) created for and by LIV, including any new features that augment or enhance the YouTube Integration. If you choose to use the YouTube Live API integration (the “YouTube Integration”), you will be asked to provide certain information in order to generate your YouTube Live credentials. LIV does not share these credentials, but they are stored on our web servers and are communicated to LIV’s software. In addition, a refresh token and access token are stored within the LIV App’s settings file that is located in your personal settings folder. This file is stored on your local computer and thus never transmitted outside of the application. Any non-authentication data regarding your YouTube account is only stored on LIV servers or your local computer.&nbsp;<br>‍<br><strong>What Happens When We Transfer Your Personal Data<br><br></strong>Personal data we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy in the United States or in any country where we have operations or where we engage vendors or service providers. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you originally provided the data. We rely on a variety of legal mechanisms to help lawfully support transfers of personal data outside the country where it was collected.
