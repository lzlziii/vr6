<br>
These scans are reconstructed from input videos taken by helmet-held
 360 cameras.
They can be explored by moving like a pedestrian.
They are results of <a href="http://maxime.lhuillier.free.fr">methods</a> that
 i design, implement and experiment, without manual clean up.

For each environment, the table provides the name,
informations about the acquisition (camera and approximate trajectory length),
number of triangles, video and screenshots,
 <b>freely downloadable VR applications</b> for exploring the scan in three
 cases of headsets:<br>
(1) standalone Oculus Quest (including Go and Quest 2),<br>
(2) headsets compatible with Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) and linked to a PC,
 including Oculus headsets,<br>
(3) headsets compatible with OpenVR (in SteamVR) and linked to a PC.<br>
Two controllers with joysticks or touchpads are needed in all cases
 (except the Go).
The applications are generated by Unity 2019.4 with preview packages.
In theory, an application works for all headsets in its case, but in
 practice i cannot check every headset.
Actually i experiment Oculus Quest and Go, Lenovo Explorer and HP Reverb G2,
 with a PC running Windows 10.<br>
<br>
The table also provides links to explore reduced variants of the scans
 without headset.
Only segments of the environments are textured in the reduced variants
 (with lower resolution than VR) due to a space limitation.
Remainder of reduced variants has colors encoding surface normals.<br>
<br>
Send me an email if you have a VR headset that does not work in one of the three
 cases above.
<br>
<h2>News</h2>
<b>June 2022:</b><br>
- There are discontinuous motions (ie "teleportations") by using a virtual
 laser pointer to reduce the risk of VR-sickness.
They can be used in conjunction with the continuous (translation) motions.
<br>
- Joysticks and touchpads can be used interchangeably.<br>
- The location of the user in the environment is drawn in a map: a top view of
 the surface vertices with gray levels encoding vertex density.
The map and the information pannel are hand-held and switchable.<br>
- The vertical offset of the user is adjustable to make easier various VR
 setting: sitting/standing/walking in the tracking area.
This holds for both constrained and unconstrained VR motions.
The former is better for continuous motions above the ground and the latter is
 better for discontinuous motions.<br>
- The Oculus Go has neither discontinuous motion nor adjustable vertical offset.<br>
- There is a new scan: Ruin in a forest.
<br>
<br>
<b>September 2022:</b><br>
- The installation is easier than before in case (1), see below.

<h2>Installation</h2>
In case (1), a VR application is an APK file.
Enable developer mode on your headset and install an APK of the table
 using the ADB command-line tool.
<!-- (See also
 <A HREF="https://360rumors.com/6dof-3d-models-360-videos/">here</A>.) -->
There is an easier and alternative installation method thanks to App Lab if you
 have a Quest or Quest 2:
 install an APK without the developer mode by selecting a scan on
 <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/user/330664">Sidequest</a> and by clicking on
 "Download App (Oculus)".
With App Lab versions of the APKs, triangles can be removed from scan
 background to obtain more than 60 frames per second.<br>
<br>
In case (2), a VR application is in a zipped directory.
First the PC must recognize the headset and the controllers,
 eg if you are in the default environment of WMR,
 or if the link cable is activated for the Quest.
Then download and uncompress the zip file chosen in the table, run the .exe file.
Adjust the vertical offset at the beginning if needed (using the right joystick).
Press simultaneously the two index triggers to quit the VR application.<br>
<br>
In case (3), first install Steam and SteamVR on your PC, then
 install and run the VR application as in case (2).
Note that SteamVR is automatically launched by running the .exe file.
Press the Windows button or the Oculus button of the controllers to quit
 simultaneously the VR application and SteamVR.
Alternatively, you can also use the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051374313/myworkshopfiles/">SteamVR Workshop</a> once Steam and SteamVR
 are installed your PC.
<br>
<br>
In all cases, the control instructions of a VR application are those
 described by its shot link in the table above.

<h2>Photogrammetry Methods</h2>
Papers about methods and algorithms are available
 <a href="http://maxime.lhuillier.free.fr">here</a>.<br>
<br>
In short: the structure-from-motion step includes a keyframe selection of the multi-camera video (that is good for matching and reconstruction) and a calibration refinement (from an initial rough guess), only features (interest points and edge curves) are reconstructed, then the surface is computed using topological constraints (manifoldness and lowered genus) and visibility constraints in a 3D Delaunay triangulation of the points (including sampled curves), last the texturing is done from the keyframes and the 3D coordinates are changed for VR.<br>
<br>
Here are short names of the papers and their computation steps: calibration refinement (3DV'15, CVIU'17), structure-from-motion (BMVC'07, IVC'09), surface reconstruction (CVIU'18 improved by IC3D'19), curves are matched (PAMI'02) and integrated in the surface, texturing (IC3D'20), coordinate change for VR (IC3D'21). The methods are sometimes old since my main goal is to show what can be done using what i published. It is also easier to maintain software and methods that are well known for me.
