</p><h1>PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING POLICY/Private Policy</h1>

Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at SPARKGAME. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the SPARK platform as well as related PC/console games, websites, mobile applications, products, and services we may offer to you.

We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide services to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make an administrative change, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site and/or Services after such modifications will constitute your (a) acknowledgment of the modified Privacy Policy and (b) your agreement to abide and be bound by that Policy.

If you have any problem understanding this document, do not hesitate to contact us at hello@sparkgame.com

<h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>

You may provide information to us when you choose to use the services offered by us. In providing the Services, we may collect the following types of information about you:

Identifiers, such as your email address, usernames, VR hardware, and device identifiers
Country or other global geographic descriptors;
Details you provide in response to surveys about our products, promotions and testing;
Electronic network activity, such as gameplay activity and statistics, e.g., kills, deaths, time spent in game, login activity, and device event information, including crash reports, request and referral URL's and system activity details (e.g. whether you encountered an error playing our games or lost internet access);
Commercial information, including VR hardware and platform types;
Information you provide when seeking help from us such as your name, telephone number and records of the issues you experience, or that you provide in response to surveys about our products.

When you participate in online games, in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics may also be visible to other users. Your gameplay, in-game profile information, and in-game voice chats may also be recorded by us (and/or by other users) in connection with enforcing the terms and conditions of the Services referred to above.When you participate in online games, in-game profile information, gameplay, and statistics may also be visible to other users. Your gameplay, in-game profile information, and in-game voice chats may also be recorded by us (and/or by other users) in connection with enforcing the terms and conditions of the Services referred to above.

<h3>How We Use Information</h3>

We respect your private privacy and despite the fact that we try to process as much information as possible as anonymized data.

We will primarily use information about you to provide the Services to you, and only use personal data for these two main purposes:to enable the functioning of SPARK and to create statistics contributing to the improvement of the game.

We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.

<h3>How long will your personal data be processed</h3>

We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

For the time when you play SPARK and until you delete your account on any platform which you used to purchase our game or until you ensure complete the erasure of SPARK from your library on any given platform . However, most of the data is kept in aggregate statistics (when you cannot be identified) for as long as necessary.

<h3>Your Rights to privacy</h3>

You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.

You have the right to access processed personal data at anytime. We will provide this data to you free of charge on the basis of your request by sending e-mails to hello@sparkgame.com. 

You may demand us to erase your personal data. If you think that your personal data is no longer needed for the purpose for which it has been processed; if you believe that your personal data is processed by SPARK illegally; or if SPARK processes personal data of a child without any parental consent given for such processing.However, it is not always possible to erase the personal data provided by you because of the fact that if we erased them, you would no longer be able to play SPARK.

If you believe that your personal data processed by  SPARK is incorrect, you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data to verify the accuracy of your personal data and to rectify it if needed. 

However, it needs to be stressed that such objection should be well-founded. Therefore, we recommend you to firstly obtain all the necessary information at the above-mentioned email address. 

Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information or wish to have your personal information removed, feel free to contact us at hello@sparkgame.com.cn.

This policy is effective as of 28 March 2022.
