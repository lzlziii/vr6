Access to these products is offered via the Ven Stake System, a group membership oriented platform designed to simplify access to information and benefits surrounding financial products only. Purchase of a Fund or Stake provides only the information acess to related Fund or Stake Groups, not actual ownership of the asset itself. In most cases, access to the Fund or Stake Group grants benefits to members correlated to purchase benefits, principal returns, interest and dividends normally associated with financial asset ownership.</div>

<div>
<h2>Digital Assets and Specks</h2>
<div>Hub Culture through Ven Finance Ltd. offers members the ability to store a range of digital assets, including cryptographic assets, price and transaction histories and pieces of data we refer to as Specks. Wherever possible, Ven Finance Ltd. provides distributed legal ownership of the data to the end user, and provides custody and other services on behalf of the customer. However, the ultimate responsibility for ownership and data management of these assets and specks lies with the end user, not with Hub Culture or Ven Finance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the event of a data breach or system compromise, the ultimate responsibility for the security of the assets held in the Hub Culture or Ven Finance ecosystem lies with the end user, not with Hub Culture or Ven Finance. Hub Culture and/or Ven Finance may charge fees associated to custody and storage of assets on behalf of the user, and these fees will be listed in the Ven transactions section of the customer account on HubCulture.com, or by extension a partner or ecosystem service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Ven Digital Asset Fund</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>PRICE VOLATILITY</div>
<div>Digital assets have experienced significant intraday and long-term price swings. In addition, operates a quarterly redemption program and may halt subscriptions from time to time. There can be no assurance that the value of the common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (âSharesâ) of Ven Digital Asset Fund (the âFundâ) will approximate the value of the digital assets held by the Fund and such Shares may trade at a substantial premium over or discount to the value of the digital assets held by the Fund. At this time, the Fund is operating a quarterly redemption program and therefore Shares are not always redeemable by the Fund. Subject to receipt of approval by the Sponsor or Manager, as applicable, in its sole discretion, the Fund may in the future cease to operate or vary its redemption program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>MARKET ADOPTION</div>
<div>It is possible that digital assets generally or any digital asset in particular will never be broadly adopted by either the retail or commercial marketplace, in which case, one or more digital assets may losemost, if not all, of its value.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>GOVERNMENT REGULATION</div>
<div>The regulatory framework of digital assets remains unclear and application of existing regulations and/or future restrictions by federal and state authorities may have a significant impact on the value of digital assets. There are substantial risks in investing in the Fund. For a complete list of all risk factors, please refer to the Private Placement Memorandum (the âMemorandumâ) for the Fund as well as the disclaimer at the end of this presentation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SECURITY</div>
<div>While the Fund has implemented security measures for the safe storage of its digital assets, there have been significant incidents of digital asset theft and digital assets remains a potential target for hackers. Digital assets that are lost or stolen cannot be replaced, as transactions are irrevocable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
