Eternal Starlight
Eternal Starlight does not currently collect any information from users and does not store any information on external servers or websites. In the future we may implement some basic analytics which will track game events such as how far you got or what mission you played but it will not track any personally identifiable information nor will it attempt to associate this data with a specific device or user. This data would merely be used to gain insights into how people play the game so that we can improve the game. It would not be shared with any third parties. We do not store any user names, scoreboards or any other information.</p>
<p>We may receive crash reports and log data and usage and sales statistics from store platforms such as Oculus and Steam. These are not shared with any other parties.</p>
