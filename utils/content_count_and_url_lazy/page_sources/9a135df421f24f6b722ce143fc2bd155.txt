For example, when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming a Shapes Corp. customer, we receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to Shapes Corp. We also occasionally collect information that is made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites and changing your privacy settings.</p><h3>Do we share the information we collect with third parties?</h3><p>We may share the information that we collect (if not constricted by non-disclosure agreement), both personal and non-personal, with our current and future affiliated companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, we may also share or transfer your personal and non-personal information to our successors-in-interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and the app, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through the app. We will likely share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and for you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection speed, whether you have visited the app in a shared location, and type of the device used to visit the app. They may aggregate information about our advertising and what you see on the app and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.</p><p>Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?</p><p>Shapes Corp. will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.</p><h3>How Do We Use The Information We Collect?</h3><p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:</p><ul role="list"><li>To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)</li><li>To improve our app (we continually strive to improve our app offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</li><li>To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)</li><li>To process transactions</li><li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature</li><li>To send periodic emails</li></ul><h3>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h3><p>By submitting your email address on this app, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link (if present) or by contacting us directly. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy.</p><h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3><p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide our services to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p><h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3><p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Shapes Corp. or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p><h3>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h3><p>Shapes Corp. is incorporated in the United States of America. Information collected via our app, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p><h3>Is the information collected through the Shapes Corp. Services secure?</h3><p>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p><h3>Can I update or correct my information?</h3><p>The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information Shapes Corp. collects depend on your relationship with Shapes Corp. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company employment policies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to <strong>(1)</strong> update or correct your personally identifiable information, <strong>(2)</strong> change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or <strong>(3)</strong> delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hey@shapesxr.com">hey@shapesxr.com</a></p><h3>Sale of Business</h3><p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Shapes Corp. or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that portion of Shapes Corp. or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p><h3>Affiliates</h3><p>We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates.

If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our website, or use our services. Continued use of the website, direct engagement with us, or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not significantly affect the use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you accept those changes.</p><h3>Your Consent</h3><p>We've updated our Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what is being set when you visit our site and how it's being used. By using our applications (ShapesXR, Tvori), registering an account, or making a purchase, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p><h3>Links to Other Websites</h3><p>Our service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us.

Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access functionality on our website correctly or at all. We never place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.</p><p>Blocking and disabling cookies and similar technologies</p><p>Wherever you're located you may also set your browser to block cookies and similar technologies, but this action may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning properly, and you may not be able to fully utilize all of its features and services. You should also be aware that you may also lose some saved information (e.g. saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser. Different browsers make different controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p><h3>Payment Details</h3><p>In respect to any credit card or other payment processing details you have provided us, we commit that this confidential information will be stored in the most secure manner possible.</p><h3>Kids' Privacy</h3><p>We do not address anyone under the age of 13.
