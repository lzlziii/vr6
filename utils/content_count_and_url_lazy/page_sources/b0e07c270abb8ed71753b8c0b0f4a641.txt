</p>

<p>
    Your principal rights under EU data protection law include:
    Access: You can request more information about the personal data Medicalholodeck holds about you. You can also request a copy of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, Medicalholodeck will supply to you a copy of your personal data, or do one of the following:<br>
    - Medicalholodeck may ask you to verify your identity, or ask for more information about your request; or<br>
    - Where Medicalholodeck is legally permitted to do so, Medicalholodeck may decline your request, but Medicalholodeck will explain why if Medicalholodeck does so.<br>
    Rectification: If you believe that any personal data Medicalholodeck is holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that Medicalholodeck correct or supplement such data. You can also correct some of this information directly by logging into your service account. Please contact us as soon as possible upon noticing any such inaccuracy or incompleteness.<br>
    Objection: You can contact us to let us know that you object to the collection or use of your personal data for certain purposes.
    Erasure: You can request that Medicalholodeck erase some or all of your personal data from Medicalholodeck’s systems. There are exclusions of the right to erasure.

</h3>
<p>Medicalholodeck retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide Medicalholodeck’s Products and Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with Medicalholodeck’s legal obligations, and enforcing Medicalholodeck’s agreements.

Moreover, Medicalholodeck is required to maintain appropriate business records, including records of assessments used for training and compliance.
