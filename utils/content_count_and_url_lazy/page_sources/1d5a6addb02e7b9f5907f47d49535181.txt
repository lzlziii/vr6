(Please also review, if applicable, the Terms of Service agreement with JanusVR, which shall govern in the event of any inconsistency with this Privacy Policy.)

Information we collect:

If users enable "party mode" (disabled by default), JanusVR "presence servers" (servers used to allow communication between users) will track URLs being visited during use of the software.  These URLs are stored by our servers in order to support "party mode" and "popular space" functions in the software.  This information we make publicly available to all users of the software.

As JanusVR can be used to browse any website, privacy policies for those sites apply, and users acknowledge and accept that JanusVR is not liable for any personal information provided to these sites by use of our software.

JanusVR may also be used with "custom presence servers".  These are "presence servers" run by third parties which may have their functionality extended (and which can be extended to track user activity, such as but not limited to: username, activity in the room such as head and hand gesture data, voice communication, and so on).  Users acknowledge and accept that JanusVR is not liable for any personal information provided to these third party servers by use of our software.
