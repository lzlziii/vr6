Third-Party Services</h3><p>The Privacy Policy only applies to personal data that MOR collects, processes and discloses and does not apply to the collection, processing and disclosure of data by third parties, through third-party services, which may be broader than set forth in this Privacy Policy, and that may be embedded into the Service. In many cases, third-parties may collect personal information about a user’s online activities over time and across different websites and services. We strongly recommend that you read each third-party privacy policy carefully before using the Service. MOR may provide data to third-parties. &nbsp;Please contact us directly using the information found below if you would like to learn more about third-party data practices. A full list of third-parties that we share your personal data with can be found here:</p><p>‍</p><h5><strong>Analytics</strong></h5><ul role="list"><li>Google Analytics with anonymized IP : <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li></ul><h5><strong>Site Operations</strong></h5><ul role="list"><li>Webflow: <a href="https://webflow.com/privacy">https://webflow.com/privacy</a></li><li>Airtable: <a href="https://airtable.com/privacy">https://airtable.com/privacy</a></li><li>Zapier: <a href="https://zapier.com/privacy">https://zapier.com/privacy</a></li><li>Amazon Web Services (AWS): <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/</a></li></ul><h5><strong>Contacting the User</strong></h5><ul role="list"><li>Mailchimp: <a href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/</a></li><li>‍</li></ul><h3>5. Cookies and Digital Tracking Technologies</h3><p>The Service may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, java beacons and clear GIFs, to collect data about you, such as your IP address. Based on the data collected from the above listed tracking technologies, third-parties may be able to resolve your identity across multiple devices, for example, by matching your IP address, in order to target you based on your behavior. A full list of cookies and tracking technologies can be found here: <a href="https://www.museumor.com/cookies">https://www.museumor.com/cookies</a>. This data is collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable third-party privacy policies.</p><p>‍</p><h3>6. Obtaining, rectifying and controlling your personal data</h3><p>You may contact MOR to obtain a copy of any personal data we collected about you, the production of which may be subject to a fee as permitted by applicable law. In addition, you may contact MOR to correct inaccurate personal data or to complete incomplete personal data.</p><p>You may be able to opt-out of some or all of the ways in which your personal data is processed, or request the deletion of certain personal data, except where the personal data is necessary or vital:</p><ul role="list"><li>for the performance of contractual obligations, such as the terms of use;</li><li>to comply with our legal obligations;</li><li>to protect your interests or those of another person; or</li><li>for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third-party,</li></ul><p>and may do so by removing personal data, if the Service permits such removal, by ceasing your access to MOR and contacting us using the contact information found below.</p><p>‍</p><h3>7. Data Storage, Retention and Transfers</h3><p>While MOR is a Canadian company, the data you provide through the Service may be stored and processed by third parties in countries around the world. You authorize MOR and third parties acting on our behalf to process your data in any country of their choosing, which may cause your data, including personal and anonymous data, to be subject to privacy protections and legal rights that may not be equivalent to those in your country.</p><p>MOR complies with international personal data transfer laws in applicable jurisdictions. For residents in the European Economic Area (the “<strong>EEA</strong>”), MOR complies with Articles 44-49 of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “<strong>GDPR</strong>”). Currently, all transfers of personal data to Canada from residents of the EEA are covered by an adequacy decision as described in Article 45 of the GDPR.</p><p>Your personal data is retained until you request its deletion or until MOR no longer requires such data for the purpose for which it was collected or until required to be deleted by laws applicable in your jurisdiction.</p><p>‍</p><h3>8. Children</h3><p>MOR complies with the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and all other applicable privacy laws and regulations concerning children and the Internet including laws applicable to residents of the EEA. The Service and the Museum are not directed to children under the age of 18 and although it may be possible that children below the age of 18 access certain features of the Service, we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 18 without first obtaining the appropriate parental consent required by law. If we learn that we inadvertently collected personal data from a child under the age of 18, in a jurisdiction where consent of a parent or guardian is required to be collected prior to the collection of such personal data, without first obtaining such appropriate parental consent, we will delete that data as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under 18, who you believe provided MOR with personal data without your consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:editor@museumor.com">editor@museumor.com</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h3>9. Do Not Track Disclosure</h3><p>Do Not Track (“<strong>DNT</strong>”) is a web or device setting that allows users to request that receivers of personal data stop their tracking activities. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser or device or use alternative consumer choice mechanisms, your browser or device sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, advertising networks, plug in providers and other web services you encounter to stop tracking your activity. Currently, there are no DNT technology standards and it is possible that there may never be any DNT technology standards. As a result, we do not respond to DNT requests.</p><p>‍</p><h3>10. California 'Shine The Light' Right</h3><p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code § 1798.83 grants you the right to request our disclosure of the categories of personal information we provided to third parties, and the names and addresses of these third parties, for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make this request, please contact us using the contact information set forth below.</p><p>Please note that you may only make this request once per year.</p><p>‍</p><h3>11. European users and rights of European Economic Area residents</h3><p>MOR has a legitimate interest, as described in Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, in collecting your personal data described in this Privacy Policy for the purposes described section 3 of this Privacy Policy unless a different lawful basis applies. In some cases, such as when we collect data associated with your actions in the Museum, the processing of your personal data is necessary for our provision of the Services to you, as described in Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. In other cases, such as when you provide consent to contact you using your email address, MOR may collect your personal data pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR.</p><p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have certain rights in regards to your personal data. These rights include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>A Right of Access.</strong> You have the right to access your personal data that we hold about you free of charge in most circumstances.</li><li><strong>A Right to Rectification.</strong> If your personal data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can change the information you provided by changing the information yourself or by contacting MOR using the email listed below.</li><li><strong>A Right to Erasure.</strong> You have the right to obtain deletion of personal data concerning you in many cases. In many cases, you may simply delete your information by yourself or requesting the deletion by using the contact information found below. Please be careful as deletion of your data in this manner is permanent and your data cannot be recovered.</li><li><strong>A Right to Object.</strong> If the processing of your personal data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR or if your personal data was collected based on your consent, you have the right to object to this processing. If you object we will no longer process your personal data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing as described in Article 21 of the GDPR; in particular if the personal data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or if personal data is required for the provision of the Service and you still wish to use the Service.</li><li><strong>A Right to file a Complaint.</strong> You have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in your jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>A Right to Restriction of Processing of your Personal Data.</strong> You have the right to obtain restrictions on the processing of your personal data as described in Article 18 of the GDPR.</li><li><strong>A Right to Personal Data Portability.</strong> You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such data to another controller under the conditions described in Article 20 of the GDPR.</li><li><strong>A Right to Post-Mortem Control of Your Personal Data.</strong> Certain jurisdictions grant post-mortem controls of your personal data and if such rights are applicable in your jurisdiction, you may have the right to establish guidelines for the preservation, the deletion and the transmission of your personal data after your death though a will or through your estate.</li><li><strong>A Right to Opt-out of Marketing Communications.</strong> You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link on any marketing e-mails MOR sends you.

Change of Ownership or Business Transition</h3><p>In the event of, or in preparation for, a change of ownership or control of MOR or a business transition such as the sale of MOR or the sale or license of some or all MOR’s assets, we may disclose and/or transfer your personal and anonymous data to third-parties who will have the right to continue to collect and use such data in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>‍</p><h3>13. Security</h3><p>We are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or breach, we put in place suitable physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the data we collect and process.</p><p>‍</p><h3>14. Contact Preferences</h3><p>We communicate with our users primarily through the Service itself and our online forums, but we may sometimes collect the email address of some of our users in order to respond to support requests or comments. If you have provided us with your email address and would like to change the email preferences we associate with you (for example, unsubscribing from receiving certain types of email) you may do so by clicking a link within certain types of emails that we send to you or, if no link is available, by replying with “unsubscribe” in the email title or body or by modifying your email settings within the Service. On rare occasions, some types of email are necessary for the Service and cannot be unsubscribed from if you continue to use the Service.</p><p>‍</p><h3>15. Updates</h3><p>MOR reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the Privacy Policy at any time (“<strong>Updates</strong>”) and shall make Updates available on the Website.
