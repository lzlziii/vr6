If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p><h4>Arbitration Rules</h4><p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.adr.org/arb_med</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p><h4>Arbitration Process</h4><p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and a separate form for California residents at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p><h4>Arbitration Location and Procedure</h4><p>Unless you and Playful otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in COLLIN County, Texas. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Playful submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p><h4>Arbitrator’s Decision</h4><p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Playful will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p><h4>Fees</h4><p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.</p><h4>Changes</h4><p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if Playful changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to contactus@playfulstudios.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Playful’s email to you notifying you of such change.

Accordingly, this Privacy Policy is provided to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use our Services (as defined in our Terms of Service (the “<b>Terms of Service</b>”), accessible at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://playfulstudios.com/terms#termsofservice">https://www.playfulstudios.com/terms#termsofservice</a>). By using our Services or registering an Account, you hereby agree to this Privacy Policy. Playful reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy, in our sole discretion, at any time for any reason. This Privacy Policy applies only to those websites, services and applications included within our “Services” and doesn’t apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p><h3>How do we collect information?</h3><p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder) and to provide you with an enjoyable use of our Services.</p><h3>Information You Provide</h3><h4>Account Information</h4><p>When you create an Account we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your first name, surname, and email address (“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”). We may also collect certain information that is not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you, such as your country of residence. We may request additional information in the course of your use of the Services.</p><h4>Community Participation</h4><p>When you use the Services to communicate with other users, whether by public forum posting, “personal message,” in-game chat or other communication features available in the Games or community areas of our Site, such communications are transmitted and stored by us.&nbsp; These communications are considered public and there is no expectation of privacy. We may monitor such communications and, by using the communication services in our Games and/or community areas of our Site, you are indicating that you agree to such monitoring.</p><h4>Note Regarding International Users</h4><p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located in the United States. By providing us with your information, you are accepting and agreeing to that transfer.</p><h3>Note Regarding Children</h3><p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as reasonably possible.</p><h3>Information We Collect</h3><h4>Information Collected Using Cookies</h4><p>We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services via the Site. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services in order to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party service providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.</p><h4>Information Related to Use of the Services</h4><p>Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services via the Site, Apps, or Software (we refer to this information as “<b>Log Data</b>”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “<b>User</b>”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (“<b>IP</b>”) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences.</p><h4>Location Information</h4><p>In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.</p><h3>Where Do We Collect Information?</h3><h4>Site</h4><p>When you visit our Site, we collect PII that you submit to us when you register for an Account and as requested in connection with the Services.&nbsp; We also use cookies on our Site to collect Log Data. In addition, if you use our forums or community areas of our Site or communicate with other users through our Site, such communications are stored by us and can be monitored by us.</p><h4>Games</h4><p>When you use our Apps and Software, we collect PII that you submit to us when you register for an Account and as requested in connection with the Services.&nbsp; We also use code within the Apps and Software to monitor our Games, including collection of certain Log Data. In addition, if you use our in-game communication tools, such communications are stored by us and can be monitored by us.</p><h3>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</h3><p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:</p><h4>Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</h4><p>We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. The third-party service providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your PII for any other purpose.</p><h4>Information Shared with Third Parties.</h4><p>We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</p><h4>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</h4><p>Information that we collect from our Users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.</p><h4>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</h4><p>It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal system, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or the public in general; and (iv) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p><h4>Information We Disclose With Your Consent or at Your Request.</h4><p>We will share your PII with third-party sites or platforms, such as social networking sites, if you have expressly requested that we do so.</p><h3>The Security of Your Information</h3><p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.</p><h3>Links to Other Sites</h3><p>Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of other websites and services that you access.</p><h3>Accessing, Modifying, and/or Deleting Your Information</h3><p>You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by accessing your user profile on the Services.&nbsp; At any time you have the right to request a copy of your data stored in your PII. You also have the right to request that your PII be deleted or corrected, in the case that you have changed your mind or the data is incorrect. You may also object to the further processing or demand a restriction concerning the processing of your personal data in PII. If you want us to deactivate your account, you can contact us at contactus@playfulstudios.com with your request. If you want us to delete your PII, you can contact us at contactus@playfulstudios.com with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon as is reasonably practicable (as far as possible according to applicable law).</p><h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3><p>Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, modify and revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of such changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll indicate when such changes will become effective.</p><h3>Questions?</h3><p>Please contact us at contactus@playfulstudios.com if you have any questions about our Privacy Policy.</p></article><article id="acceptableusepolicy"><h1>Acceptable Use Policy</h1><p>Playful seeks to foster responsible and respectful user interaction in connection with the Services, including our Games.
