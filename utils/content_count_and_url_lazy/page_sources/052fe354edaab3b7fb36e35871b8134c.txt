•   when you submit information as part of a competition or otherwise interact with our social media channels (for example, by providing a testimonial about one of our Services) we may publish the information you submitted, alongside your name and platform on our website and social media channels;<br>

•   in the event that there is a sale of the assets of QuiVr, or as a result of a change of control of QuiVr, or in preparation of any of these events, provided that any third party to which QuiVr transfers of sells QuiVr's assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We will not sell or rent your information to any third party outside of these circumstances.<br>
<br>
7. Third-Party Networks/Platforms.  You may allow our Services to interact with a third party social network or platform, which will provide information about you to us. These applications or websites are created and maintained by a third party that is not a part of, or controlled by QuiVr. You should ensure that you read their terms of service and privacy policies to understand how they treat your data and what data they might share with us.
<br><br>
You understand that where you allow our Services to interact with any third party social network or platform, we may share data about you with your contacts (and vice versa) in order that you may enjoy playing socially or in tournaments (the “Social Data”). This Social Data includes your name, your social media profile picture and your scores and/or progress in our games.
<br><br>
You can make changes to what data a third party social network or platform shares with us, or stop our Services interacting with that social network or platform by adjusting your settings with that third party provider, however you may find you are not able to enjoy all of the same features of our Services.
<br><br>
Users of our Services may be automatically assigned a profile which is visible to other users of our Services. Your profile may include the Social Data described above, game achievements or other game play information and details of which other QuiVr account holders have viewed your profile. Your profile will be visible to other users of our services. If you choose to view another individual's profile, that individual and other users of our Services may know that you have visited them because some of your Social Data and a link to your profile may be displayed on that individual’s profile. They will also be able to visit your profile.
<br><br>
8. Data Retention.  We will retain your Personal Information for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as needed to provide you with Services. We may retain your Personal Information after you have closed any account you have with us or after we have ceased providing Services to you if retention of your Personal Information is reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations, meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes between members, prevent fraud, cheating or abuse, or enforce this Privacy Policy or any other agreement we may have with a user. Your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored at, and processed by staff who work for us or for one of our suppliers, at a facility outside the USA. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

9.  Voice Chat.  Users of QuiVr can communicate with other players during game play. We will never collect any waveform audio data, but may collect anonymized decibel rating data for analytics purposes. This allows us to tell when you are speaking, but not what you are saying.<br><br>

10.  Protection of Personal Information.  The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We strive to maintain appropriate technical and physical safeguards to protect your Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, use and all other unlawful forms of processing of the data in our possession. We use the same level of skill in protecting your Personal Information as other similar games developers. However, since the internet is not a completely secure environment we cannot guarantee that information you transmit via our Games will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards. You understand that we are a game developer and game service provider, not a bank, hospital or military, and thus do not expect to be a desirable hacker target, nor to develop or implement industrial-grade security protocols.  But we invite you to make suggestions in the interest of privacy and enjoyable services.
<br><br>
11.  Links from our Services.  We may provide links to third party websites from our Services. You understand that when you click on these links any data which you provide thereafter is subject to such third party's privacy policy and not to ours. Although we will endeavor only to link to reputable websites, QuiVr takes no responsibility for the content, safety or security of any third party website.
<br><br>
12. Your rights in relation to your Personal Information.<br>
•   You have the right to request a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your Personal Information, please contact us at support@alvios.com - we may make a small charge for this.<br>
•   We want to make sure that your Personal Information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to modify, correct or remove information by contacting us at the email address above.<br>
•   Information that you have shared via our Services on any social network or third party platform cannot be amended or deleted by us where it is in the control of that social network or third party platform. In addition, where any third party copies information which you have made available via the use of our Services (for example, one of your friends on a social network you allow to interact with your account), we may not be able to amend or delete it because it may not be in our control.<br>
•   You have the right to ask us not to use your Personal Information for marketing purposes. To change your marketing preferences, or to unsubscribe, or for any other information, please contact us at support@alvios.com.<br>
<br>
13. Complaints<br>
We hope that you won't have any complaints about QuiVr or our Services. If you are unhappy with our use of your Personal Information then please contact our customer services department by emailing support@alvios.com.
<br><br>
You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority if there is a problem.
<br><br>
14.  Legal matters<br>
You must be at least 13 years old to use our Services, or have the express permission of your parent or legal guardian. If any court or other competent authority finds any of the terms of this Privacy Policy to be invalid or unenforceable, the other terms of this Privacy Policy will not be affected. This Privacy Policy is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Florida. Any dispute arising in connection with this Privacy Policy will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Florida unless you choose the courts of your home country. <br>
<br>
We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements or any other changes to our business or applicable law. We will endeavor to tell you about any significant changes to this Privacy Policy we feel may disadvantage you in any material way. If you have any concerns about having your data used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy you should not use our Services. If you object to any of the changes you should immediately stop using our Services and close any account you may have with us.<br>
<br>
15.  We welcome your suggestions, advice and comments. Thanks.<br>
