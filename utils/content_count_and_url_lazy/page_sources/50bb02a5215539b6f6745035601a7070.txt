  <h1>Cubism: Privacy Policy</h1>
  <dev class="tldr">
    <p>
      TL;DR - Protecting your privacy is important to us,
      so only anonymous gameplay analytics and error logs are collected (which puzzles are solved, average solve times,
      etc.)
      to help improve the game and resolve bugs.<br><br>
      No personal data (e.g. e-mail address, IP address, ...)
      is stored in any of these logs or analytics. If this ever changes in the future, this privacy policy will be updated
      to reflect that. <br>The game has a local level editor, which will add your username as the author to any puzzles you create. However, these puzzles are only stored locally on your device and are never shared with us directly.<br><br>
      If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us at info@cubism-vr.com! <br>
      Now here's the legal stuff:
