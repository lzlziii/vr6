<p><a href="#norm-hd">Back to top</a></p>
<h4 id="principles">Principles</h4>
<p>The NFB is an agent of the federal Crown and complies with the Canadian Privacy Act (R.S. 1985 c. P-21), which protects personal information from improper use and disclosure and gives individuals the right to request access to information about themselves, to request correction of their personal information if they feel it contains errors or omissions, or to have their personal information removed from personal information banks.</p>
<p><a href="#norm-hd">Back to top</a></p>
<h4 id="kinds">Kinds of information we collect</h4>
<p>There are two kinds of information that <span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Products </span> can obtain about you: aggregate information and personal information.</p>
<p><a href="#norm-hd">Back to top</a></p>
<h4 id="aggregate-information">Aggregate information</h4>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aggregate information is anonymous data that Digital Products use to help improve the quality of your experience.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our Digital Products collect certain aggregate information such as your IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you enter our site), browser type (e.g. Firefox or Internet Explorer) and domain name (e.g. xyz.com). We do this in the background so it does not affect your navigation speed. None of this information is connected with personal information about you. The NFB performs statistical analyses of user behaviour in order to measure interest in and use of the various Digital Products so as to improve design and navigation and to help diagnose problems. Only aggregate data is used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Since July 2023, the NFB uses Google Signals. When this feature is activated, Google Analytics associate the visitation <span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;">information it collects from our digital platforms with Google information from accounts of signed-in users who have consented to this association for the purpose of ads personalization. This Google information may include end user location, search history, YouTube history, and data from sites that partner with Google. It is used to provide aggregated and anonymized insights into our users’ cross device behaviors. If you do not wish to provide this information to the NFB or other websites, you can deactivate the option via your Google profile, under <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity?pli=1">My Activity</a></span></p>
<p><a href="#norm-hd">Back to top</a></p>
<h4 id="personal-information">Personal information</h4>
<p>Personal information is any information that personally identifies you. It could be your first and last name, your e-mail address, your home address, your telephone number, your credit card number, information contained in a résumé, or your personal views and opinions.</p>
<p>Such personal information is needed when, for instance, you order products online, post a comment, engage with an interactive experience, or electronically apply for a job at the NFB, or if we need to reply to you.</p>
<p>When you order products online and supply a credit card number, this number is encrypted and transmitted to the Canadian government payment gateway (Receiver General Buy Button) for the electronic acceptance of payments. Credit card numbers are used only for processing payments and are not retained for any other purpose. The payment process uses a Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Once the customer’s personal information has been provided securely, the credit card number is immediately encrypted by buy button in secure transaction storage and no longer retrievable in an unencrypted format.</p>
<p>We may also occasionally ask you to voluntarily provide us with other demographic information or information about your interest in and use of various products. This enables us to give you more appropriate information or more personalized service.</p>
<p>We will always inform you when personal information is required in order to obtain a service. If we are asking for mandatory information, we will mark it with an asterisk (*). If there is no asterisk, you need not provide the information.</p>
<p><a href="#norm-hd">Back to top</a></p>
<h4 id="what">Our Cookie Policy</h4>

<p><a href="#norm-hd">Back to top</a></p>
<h4 id="disclosure">Disclosure of information to third parties</h4>
<p>Personal information provided to the NFB is never sold or rented. We will disclose information we maintain only if so required by a subpoena, warrant or court order. Otherwise, personal information provided to the NFB will never be passed on to third parties without the prior knowledge and consent of the person concerned.</p>
<p>If we ever need to share personal information with a third party (e.g. if we ask a consultant to conduct a survey for us), we will always let you know that the information will be shared and what it will be used for. It will then be up to you to decide whether to provide the information or not.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a government institution subject to the Canadian Privacy Act (R.S.&nbsp;1985 c. P-21), we must notify the Privacy Commissioner in writing of any disclosure of personal information before using that information for a purpose other than that for which it was obtained.</p>
<p><a href="#norm-hd">Back to top</a></p>
<h4 id="links">Links to other sites</h4>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our digital products may contain links to suitable third-party digital products. However, the linked digital products are not under the control of the NFB, and we are not responsible for the content of any linked digital product or any link contained in a linked digital product.</p>

<h4 id="nfb-presence-on-third-party-platforms">NFB Presence on Third-Party Platforms</h4>
