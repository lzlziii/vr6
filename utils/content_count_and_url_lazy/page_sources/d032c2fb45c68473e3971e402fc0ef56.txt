<br>
Under very specific circumstances, we will process your personal data and share it with third parties (including law enforcement bodies) in order to respond to or investigate fraudulent, unauthorised or criminal (or potentially fraudulent, unauthorised or criminal) activity on or related to our systems, services, or events, including the unauthorized disclosure of non-public information related to current or future services. We may also be required by law to disclose your personal data to the police or to another law enforcement, regulatory, government or other public body in your country of origin or elsewhere, including upon receiving a legally valid request to do so. We may also be required by law to disclose your personal data to third parties in response to a court order, subpoena, or other compulsory process.
<br>
<br>
<em>If you are located in the EU/EEA or the UK, our legal bases for this is legal obligation or legitimate interest.</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>5. WHAT THE DIFFERENT LEGAL BASES MEAN</strong>
<br>
<br>
This section explains what the legal bases we rely on for processing your personal data actually mean (as applicable in your local jurisdiction).
<br>
<br>
<strong>a) Consent</strong>
<br>
<br>
You have provided consent for us to process your personal data for a specific purpose (if you are located in the EU/EEA Art. 6 (1) a GDPR). You have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.
<br>
<br>
<strong>b) Performance of Contract</strong>
<br>
<br>
We need to process your personal data for us to fulfil our contractual relationship with you or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (if you are located in the EU/EEA Art. 6 (1) b GDPR).
<br>
<br>
<strong>c) Legitimate interests</strong>
We need to process your personal data for our legitimate interests, or the legitimate interests of a third party, e.g., in conducting and managing our business and our relationship with you, except when such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular when the data subject is a child (if you are located in the EU/EEA Art. 6 (1) f GDPR). When we use your personal data for our legitimate interests, we take into account any potential impact that such use may have on you. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>d) Legal obligation</strong>

<strong>6. KEEPING YOUR PERSONAL DATA SECURE</strong>
<br>
<br>
We treat your personal data with care and take reasonable steps to protect it, including the use of physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure.
<br>
<br>
For this reason, we secure access to all transactional areas of our websites and apps, restrict access to your personal data, secure and tokenise transactional information and regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.
<br>
<br>
If you believe your personal data has been breached, please contact us at the email address at the end of this document. 
<br>
<br>
<strong>7. RECIPIENTS WITH WHOM WE SHARE PERSONAL DATA </strong>
<br>
<br>
Depending on the purpose for which we collect your personal data or the nature of our interaction with you, we may use third parties to process some of your personal data (for example, we engage third parties to process information about your purchases and use of our games). We require that these third parties use only the information they need to perform their specific services as specified in our contract with them. If we stop using any such third party's services, we require that your personal data held by them is either securely and permanently deleted or rendered irreversibly anonymous. In all cases, we apply measures to keep your data safe and your privacy protected.
<br>
<br>
We share your personal data with third-party IT companies who support our website, online services and other business systems, payment services providers who process your payments for goods and services, fraud detection, investigation and prevention companies who help us detect, investigate and prevent cheating, abuse, fraud, tampering or other unauthorised use of or disclosure of non-public information about our current and future services and direct marketing companies who help us manage our electronic communications with you.
<br>
<br>
We may share your personal data with Google, Facebook and other third-party advertising partners so they can show you our products and services that might be of interest to you while you are on a social media platform, browsing the internet or playing our mobile games (see above under Section 4(e)). For example, if you provide us with your email address we may share it with Facebook so that you can receive tailored advertising from us when you use Facebook, and so that other users of Facebook who share similar interests to you can also receive tailored advertising from us.
<br>
<br>
We may share your personal data with governmental authorities, courts, external advisors, and similar third parties that are public bodies or with other (private) third parties as required or permitted by applicable law (see above under Section 4(o)).
<br>
<br>
<strong>8. COOKIES</strong>
<br>
<br>
We use cookies and similar technologies for analytics, to allow our services to operate effectively, to enhance your experience when using our services and to bring you relevant advertising.
<br>
<br>
Please have a look at our Cookies Notice (available at <a href="http://www.crystald.com/legal/cookies">http://www.crystald.com/legal/cookies</a> for Crystal Dynamics, Inc. and at <a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/cookies">https://www.eidosmontreal.com/cookies</a> for Eidos Interactive Corp.) for more information.
<br>
<br>
<strong>9. WHERE YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED</strong>
We are a global organisation, so we sometimes will share your personal data with our other offices, or with other third parties and suppliers, who are located outside your country and the European Economic Area ("EEA") or may have relevant operations outside of your country and the EEA, such as in the USA, where the data protection laws may provide a different level of protection compared to the laws in your jurisdiction. 
<br>
<br>
When it is necessary for us to transfer your personal data out of the EEA and/or the UK, we will do so only when the transfer is authorised under applicable law, including when the transfer is made to a country the European Commission has deemed to have adequate data protection laws. The countries which provide an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faeroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Switzerland and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay. With regard to data transfers to other recipients outside the EEA we provide appropriate safeguards, in particular, by way of entering into data transfer agreements adopted by the European Commission (e.g., based on standard contractual clauses) with the recipients or taking other measures to provide an adequate level of data protection, where this is required under applicable law.   
<br>
<br>
<strong>10. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DATA</strong>
<br>
<br>
We store personal data as long as necessary to fulfill the respective purposes. When we no longer need personal data to comply with our contractual or legal obligations, we will securely destroy or irreversibly anonymise your personal data. We will deviate from this general policy only if we have to fulfill legal or official obligations (e.g., statutory retention obligations, including statutory retention periods which can result from commercial and tax law—for example, in the EU or Germany, the retention periods are typically between six and ten years for contracts, notifications and business letters) or if we need it to preserve evidence within a statute of limitation.  
<br>
<br>
<strong>11. YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
<br>
<br>
Under applicable data protection law, you have the right, in addition to the right to withdraw your consent at any time (the withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal), to make a complaint to a data protection supervisory authority. In addition, you may be entitled to the following rights (though these rights may be restricted by national law). To exercise your rights, please contact us using the contact details provided under 14 below.
<br>
<br>
<strong>a) Your right of access</strong>

The right of access includes, among other things, access to the purposes of the processing, the categories of the personal data is being processed, and the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data is being disclosed. However, this right is not unrestricted as the rights of other persons may limit your right of access. 
<br>
<br>
In certain circumstances, you have the right to receive a copy of the personal data processed by us. For further copies requested by you, we charge a reasonable fee, where relevant calculated on the basis of administrative costs
<br>

<br>
<br>
You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances.
<br>
<br>
<strong>d) Your right to restriction of processing</strong>
<br>
<br>
You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. In that case, the data concerned will be marked and only processed by us for certain purposes.
<br>
<br>
<strong>f) Your right to data portability</strong>
<br>
<br>
Subject to certain conditions, you have the right to receive personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and the right to transmit that data to a different controller without hindrance from us.
<br>
<br>
<strong>g) Right to object</strong>
<br>
<br>
Subject to certain conditions, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data by us on grounds arising from your particular situation, and we can be required not to process your personal data any longer.
If personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have an additional right to object at any time to the processing of personal data in relation to you for the purpose of such marketing. This also applies to profiling where this is connected to direct marketing. In that case, we will no longer process the applicable personal data for these purposes.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Information Third Parties Provide about You:</strong> We may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Services with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor content and ads to you, and to offer you opportunities that may be of interest to you.

<br>
<strong>- Cookies:</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on your device when you visit the Services. Cookies may be used for many purposes, such as remembering you and your preferences, supporting our security features, and bringing you relevant advertising.

<br>
<strong>- Pixels:</strong> A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, email, or advertisement that sends information about your usage to a server. When you access a website, video, email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to place or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used in combination with cookies to track browser activity. We may incorporate pixels from third parties that allow us to track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the Services, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Services with your social media account.
<br>
<br>
<strong>- ETag or entity tag:</strong> A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where you block HTTP, Flash, and HTML5 cookies.
<br>
<br>
<strong>- Location-Identifying Technologies: </strong>GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device.
<br>
<br>

<br>

For example, if you click on a link displayed on the Services you may be taken to a different site. We may share information at your request or direction. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by these third parties. We encourage you to pay attention when you leave our Services and to review the privacy policies of any third-party locations you go to.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Administrative and Legal Disclosures: </strong>We may disclose your information to third parties: (i) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (ii) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, or governmental requestor legal process, or any legal process in connection with a court proceeding or arbitration, if in our good faith opinion we are required or permitted to do so by law; (iii) to investigate potential violations of policies or terms applicable to the Services; (iv) to protect the safety, rights, property or security of the Services, our staff, users, or any other third party; or (v) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or threats to security.

<br>
<strong>4. Ads and Analytics</strong>
<br>
<br>
The Services may use other parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve targeted advertisements based on your behavior on and off of the Services, and may use analytics, user research, or other similar parties to evaluate and provide us or other parties with information about your use of the Services and viewing of ads or content.

Ad serving enables us and others to target advertisements to you or people like you for products and services in which you or people like you might be interested. For example, if you provide us with your email address we may share it with Facebook so that you can receive targeted ads from us when you use Facebook, and so that other users of Facebook who share similar interests to you can also receive targeted ads from us. Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your device and browser. These tracking technologies may be set to, among other things, help deliver relevant advertisements, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or help understand the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. This Privacy Notice does not apply to the practices of other parties or their use of your information, so you should visit these parties’ websites for more information about their privacy practices.

<br>

<strong>Your Nevada Privacy Rights:</strong>
<br>
<br>
Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties. If you are a Nevada consumer and wish to submit a request relating to our compliance with Nevada law, please contact us by email at one of the addresses listed in Section 11 below.
<br>
<br>
<strong>7. Your California Privacy Rights:</strong>
<br>
<br>
This section describes the various rights California residents have over their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) and how you can invoke these rights with us.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Notice of collection</strong>
<br>
<br>
Consistent with the “The Types of Information We Collect from You and How We Collect It” section above, in the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information enumerated in the CCPA (“<strong>CA Personal Information</strong>”):
<br>
<br>
- Identifiers, including name, postal address, email address, and online identifiers (such as IP address).

<br>
<br>
- Commercial or transactions information, including records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered.

We collect and use these categories of CA Personal Information for the business purposes described in “How We Use the Information We Collect from You” above.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sharing CA Personal Information for Commercial Purposes. </strong>
<br>
<br>
We do not generally sell information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. To the extent “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include the activities set out in this Privacy Notice, such as those disclosed in the “Ads and Analytics” section above, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity. We disclose the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes: identifiers, characteristics, commercial or transactions information, internet activity, geolocation data, and inferences drawn. Please review “How We Share Your Information” above for further details about the categories of parties with whom we share information.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Your California consumer rights</strong>

<br>
<br>
- The categories of sources from which the CA Personal Information was collected;

<br>
<br>
- The specific pieces of CA Personal Information we have collected about you.
<br>
<br>
You also have the right to request that we delete your CA Personal Information.
<br>
<br>
To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request by email to one of the addresses listed in Section 11 below.  In the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your requests.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Your right to opt-out of the “sale” of CA Personal Information </strong>
<br>
<br>
To the extent we sell your CA Personal Information as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your CA Personal Information by us to third parties at any time. Please submit a request by email to one of the addresses listed in Section 11 below or by phone at 800-715-2450.   
<br>
<br>
<strong>Authorized agent</strong>
<br>
<br>
You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Your right to non-discrimination</strong>
<br>
<br>
You have the right not to be discriminated against in service or price if you exercise your privacy rights.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Shine the light</strong>
<br>
<br>
Customers who are residents of California may request (i) a list of the categories of personal information disclosed by us to third parties during the immediately preceding calendar year for those third parties’ own direct marketing purposes; and (ii) a list of the categories of third parties to whom we disclosed such information. To submit a request, please write us at the email or postal address set out in “Questions or Complaints” below and specify that you are making a “<strong>California Shine the Light Request</strong>.” We may require additional information from you to allow us to verify your identity and are only required to respond to requests once during any calendar year.
<br>
<br>
<strong>8. International Transfers of Information</strong>
<br>
<br>
Please be aware that information we collect may be transferred, processed, stored, and used internationally, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and other countries in the European Union. The data protection laws in these countries may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement. By using the Services, or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing, and storage of your information, including personal data, in other countries as set forth in this Privacy Notice.
<br>
<br>
For personal data transferred from the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Switzerland, we will provide appropriate safeguards, such as through use of standard contractual clauses.
<br>
<br>
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or not to provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
<br>
<br>
<strong>9.  Children’s Data</strong>
<br>
<br>
We do not knowingly collect or store any personal information as defined by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”) from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, as required by COPPA. There may be instances, such as a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion, in which we collect personal information from a child in order to contact a parent and complete prize fulfillment in accordance with COPPA. We do not knowingly “sell,” as that term is defined under the CCPA, the personal information of minors under 16 years old who are California residents.
<br>
<br>
If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 (or different age as may apply in your jurisdiction) and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us without your consent, please contact us at the addresses stated in section 11 below. We will delete the child’s personal information from our records as soon as possible.
<br>
<br>
<strong>10. Keeping Your Information Secure</strong>
<br>
<br>
We understand how important data security is to you, and we have implemented various policies, processes, and technical measures to help protect and secure your information. That said, no data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us. Please take care when transmitting information online, including through the Services, and make sure to keep your passwords and account information secure at all times. In the event we become aware of a data breach involving unencrypted notice-triggering information in our possession, we will notify you as may be required by applicable law.
