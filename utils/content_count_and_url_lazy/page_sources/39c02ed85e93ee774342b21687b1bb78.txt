                        <p>1. Who are you?</p>
                        <p>1.1. We are Manuel Pasamontes Romera (hereinafter "MPR"), delivery address
                            Plaza Col√≥n 7 Roquetas de Mar (Spain). We process your personal data as controllers under
                            the
                            European Union Data Protection Regulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>1.2. If you have problems understanding anything in this document, do not be
                            afraid to contact us at privacy@omegablade.com.
                        </p>
                        <p>2. What will I find in this document?
                        </p>
                        <p>2.1. Below you will learn why, to what extent, for what purpose and for
                            how long we process your personal data. You will also learn who will have access to your
                            personal
                            data and what your rights in relation to the processing of the personal data are.
                        </p>
                        <p>2.2. We respect your right to privacy and despite the fact that we try to
                            process as much information as possible as anonymized or pseudonymized data, we want you to
                            know
                            that your data is safe with us.
                        </p>
                        <p>3. What kind of personal data about me are you collecting and why?
                        </p>
                        <p>3.1. So that you can play Omega Blade and we are able to repair and improve
                            the game, we collect the following data about you:
                            identification data (Nickname under which you are registered);
                            technical data (data about your device etc.);
                            data concerning your use of Omega Blade (when and how and how successfully you play the
                            game).
                            We only use these personal data for the two below-specified purposes:
                            to enable the functioning of Omega Blade and
                            to create statistics contributing to the improvement of the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>3.2. Firstly, we need your personal data described above (technical data and
                            game use data) so that the game is functional, including leaderboards etc. The reason for
                            such
                            processing is based on the necessity to fulfil the agreement between you and us.
                        </p>
                        <p>3.3. Some of your personal data we need to process for our statistical
                            purposes. These include either purely technical data (i.e. information not containing any
                            personal data at all) or the other above-described data in pseudonymized form, that is,
                            highly
                            confidential data to which we assign a special number so that nobody except for us is able
                            to
                            match the data to the existing identifier using the given number. This processing is based
                            on
                            our legitimate interest which is the continuous improvement of the game. You have the right
                            to
                            object to this processing in the manner described below.
                        </p>
                        <p>4. How will you process my personal data?
                        </p>
                        <p>4.1. With regard to the above-mentioned purposes, it is apparent that we do
                            not need your personal data in a form that enables your identification. For this reason, we
                            are
                            going to process the information (especially statistics) in aggregated (non-identifiable)
                            form
                            as much as possible and where this is not possible, we are going to process the information
                            in
                            pseudonymized form as much as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>5. Do you need my consent for the processing?
                        </p>
                        <p>5.1. In fact, we do not need your consent because for all the forms of
                            processing we have other legitimate reasons (because this is necessary for fulfilment of
                            agreement or it is in our legitimate interest).
                        </p>
                        <p>6. For how long will you process my personal data?
                        </p>
                        <p>6.1. Only for the time for which you play Omega Blade and at the maximum
                            until you delete the game of all platform which you used to purchase our game. However, most
                            of
                            the data is kept in the aggregate form only (when you cannot be identified) and only for as
                            long
                            as necessary.
                        </p>
                        <p>7. Do I have to give my personal data to you? Do you have to process them?
                        </p>
                        <p>7.1. If you want to play Omega Blade, we need the said personal data so that
                            we can enable you to play. Unfortunately, this is not possible without your personal data.
                        </p>
                        <p>8. To whom do you transfer my personal data?
                        </p>
                        <p>8.1. We have the personal data in our possession for the whole time.
                        </p>
                        <p>8.2.1. Oculus.
                        </p>
                        <p>8.2.2. Steam.
                        </p>
                        <p>8.2.3. Playfab.
                        </p>
                        <p>9. What rights do I have?
                            Content of this section
                        </p>
                        <p>9.1. Having regard to the fact that MPR processes information concerning
                            you, you may assert certain rights about which we want to inform you in this section. You
                            may
                            assert all the rights in writing at the above-given postal address or by e-mail at
                            privacy@omegablade.com.
                            Right to access
                        </p>
                        <p>9.2. You have the right to access the processed personal data concerning
                            you. We will provide this data to you free of charge on the basis of your request sent to
                            the
                            above-given postal address or by e-mail to privacy@omegablade.com. Only where any costs
                            arise in
                            connection with your request, we will have to ask you to pay the necessary costs for their
                            provision.
                            Right to rectification
                        </p>
                        <p>9.3. We only need to process your accurate personal data. You have the right
                            to the rectification of your personal data which are processed incorrectly.
                            Right to erasure
                        </p>
                        <p>9.4. Under any circumstances you have the right to demand that we erase your
                            personal data. However, this is not always possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>9.5. If you think that your personal data are no longer needed for the
                            purpose for which they have been processed; if you believe that your personal data are
                            processed
                            by MPR illegally; or if MPR process personal data of a child without any parental consent
                            given
                            for such processing, you may demand that we erase your personal data.
                        </p>
                        <p>9.6. However, it is not always possible to erase the personal data provided
                            by you for instance because of the fact that if we erased them, you would no longer be able
                            to
                            play Omega Blade.
                            Right to data portability
                        </p>
                        <p>9.7. Another right you may assert is the right to data portability based on
                            which we will hand over the personal data provided by you in a commonly used, structured and
                            machine-readable format or if you require, we will transfer them to another controller of
                            your
                            own choice, where such transfer is technically feasible.
                            Right to restriction of processing
                        </p>
                        <p>9.8. If you believe that your personal data processed by MPR are incorrect,
                            you have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data for a
                            period
                            necessary to verify the accuracy of your personal data and to rectify them if needed. You
                            also
                            have this right if the processing of your personal data is illegal but you do not wish for
                            your
                            personal data to be erased; if MPR no longer needs your personal data for the
                            above-specified
                            processing purposes but you demand that your personal data are preserved for the purposes of
                            the
                            determination, exercise or defence of your legal claims; or if you have objected to the
                            processing of your personal data on the basis of MPR legitimate interest.
                            Right to object to processing on the basis of legitimate interest
                        </p>
                        <p>9.9. With regard to the fact that some of your personal data we process on
                            the basis of our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to this processing. Based
                            on
                            the objection we will consider whether it really is in our interest to process your personal
                            data for the given purpose. If we conclude that we do not have any significant legitimate
                            reasons that prevail over your interests, rights or freedoms, we will terminate the
                            processing
                            of and destroy such personal data.
                        </p>
                        <p>9.10. However, it needs to be stressed that such objection should be
                            well-founded. Therefore, we recommend you to firstly obtain all the necessary information at
                            the
                            above-mentioned email address.
                            Right to complain
                        </p>
                        <p>9.11. If you find all the above-specified rights insufficient or if your
                            opinion is that MPR in any way infringes upon your rights, you have the right to file a
                            complaint with a supervisory body or a court.</p>

                        <p>Hello! We are glad you've decided to play the Omega Blade game. Before you go, please read the following legal rules. Don't worry! We want you primarily to enjoy the game, not to put up any obstacles against it. 

                        </p><p>1. General
                        </p><p>1.1. This agreement is a contract between you and Manuel Pasamontes Romera (hereinafter "MPR"), governing your use of our Omega Blade game.
                        </p><p>1.2. For the purpose of this agreement, the term Omega Blade game includes the software of the videogame itself, all of its components (e.g., the source code) and content (e.g., graphical or musical content).
                        </p><p>1.3. This agreement applies to the Omega Blade game and all of its future updates and expansions, unless the expansion is governed by a separate agreement. If an expansion to the Omega Blade game is governed by a separate agreement, you will be explicitly asked to agree to the separate agreement.
                        </p><p>1.4. If you are a minor (below the legal age of majority in your country), please have the agreement reviewed and agreed to by your parent or legal guardian.
                        </p><p>2. Application of a distributor's terms and conditions
                        </p><p>2.1. We generally use the services of a distributor to market our Omega Blade game.
