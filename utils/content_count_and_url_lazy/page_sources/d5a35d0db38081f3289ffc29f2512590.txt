By using these tools, you acknowledge that some account information may be transmitted from the applicable platform account to us; our treatment of that information is covered by this Privacy Policy. Additionally, when you use one of these tools, the social media or third-party platform may be collecting information about your online activity through its own tracking technologies, subject to its own privacy policy.

Blocking third-party cookies in your browser settings using or ad-blocking browser plug-ins/extensions. &nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Mobile device settings.

Opting out of interest-based ads from companies participating in the following industry opt-out programs.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>&nbsp;•&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance: optout.aboutads.info, which lets you opt-out of interest-based ads on websites.&nbsp;<br>•&nbsp;AppChoices mobile app, available at https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices, which lets you opt out of interest-based ads in mobile apps.&nbsp;<br>The opt-out preferences described above must be set on each device for which you want them to apply. Not all companies that serve interest-based ads participate in the ad industry opt-out programs described above, so even after opting out, you may still receive some cookies and interest-based ads from other companies. If you opt out of interest-based advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;Do Not Track. Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “Do Not Track” or similar signals.

If you choose to connect to Ming Studio through your social media account on Facebook or Google or another third-party platform like Oculus, you may be able to use your settings in your account with that platform to limit the information we receive from it. If you revoke our ability to access information from a third-party platform, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.&nbsp;<br><br>OTHER SITES AND SERVICES&nbsp;<br>‍<br>Our Site and Services may contain links to or integrate with other websites and online services, or allow others to send you such links. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. We do not control websites or other online services operated by third parties, and Ming Studio is not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to your use of any such third-party website or online service.

We are required under the Children Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), with limited exceptions, to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose personal information from children.&nbsp;<br>Many of our Services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If our Services request age information from your child and your child indicates that he/she is under 13 years old, the Services will block your child from providing personal information.

For example, if your child provides us feedback or contacts us (for support, for example), we will collect the data included in the communication. We will use this personal information to assist your child with his/her query or support request and then delete such information once we have fulfilled the child’s query or support request. We do not share your child’s personal information with third parties, other than as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;<br>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records.&nbsp;<br><br>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFER&nbsp;<br>‍<br>We are headquartered in the United States and may use service providers in other countries.

If we change this Privacy Policy, we will give you notice by posting the revised Privacy Policy on the Site and within our Services.
