        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <img src="imgs/teleportOrb.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          One of your hands is used to create teleport orbs. Pull the trigger in
          your teleport hand to create an orb. Throw the orb and you will
          teleport to where it lands. Changing which hand is used for
          teleporting can be done quickly in the inventory.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Inventory</h2>
        <img src="imgs/inventory_screenshot.png" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          Push and hold the thumbstick button to open your inventory. Point the
          thumbstick at the item you wish to equip. Release the thumbstick
          button and you will equip the selected item. The inventory has 4 item
          slots with the bottom slot always reserved for teleport orbs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Health</h2>
        <img src="imgs/handHealth.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          Your health is displayed on your hands. Losing all health forces you
          to restart the level.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Healing</h2>
        <img src="imgs/heart.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          Using a heart item will restore health. Hearts display their remaining
          uses.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Weapons</h2>
        <img src="imgs/weapon.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          Weapons are scattered throughout each level. They can be picked up and
          stored in your inventory. Each weapon has a unique way of firing and
          reloading. Weapon types include automatic fire, sniper rifles,
          grenades, rocket launchers and more.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Ammo</h2>
        <img src="imgs/ammo.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          Weapons display their remaining ammo. They are reloaded by using your
          controller's reload button.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Enemies</h2>
        <img src="imgs/sniper.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          You will encounter a variety of enemies on your adventure. Use your
          weapons to defeat them before they defeat you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Bosses</h2>
        <img src="imgs/sorcerer_screenshot.png" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          Some levels are boss battles in which you fight a very powerful enemy.
          These enemies are often too powerful to be defeated by only shooting
          them. Instead, each boss has a hidden way of damaging them. Bosses
          display their remaining health in the surrounding environment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Completing a Level</h2>
        <img src="imgs/voidTeleporter.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          At the end of each level is a void teleporter. Throw a teleport orb
          into this teleporter to complete the level.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Home</h2>
        <img src="imgs/home.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          Completing or leaving a level returns you to your home world. This
          world contains teleporters to the void and tutorial.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="tut-step">
        <h2>Void</h2>
        <img src="imgs/void.jpg" class="tut-img">
        <p>
          The void is where you can teleport between levels. To enter a level,
          throw a teleport orb into the level's door.
