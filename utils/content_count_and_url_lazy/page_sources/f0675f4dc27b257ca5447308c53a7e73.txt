<p>Personal data should be blocked instead of deletion if requested by the data subject or if the available information suggests that the deletion would infringe the legitimate interests of the data subject.

<p>The data subject as well as all those to whom the data was previously transferred for data management  have to informed on the correction, blocking and deletion.
