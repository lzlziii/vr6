<p>Effective: Jun 27, 2022</p>



<p><strong>Intisab Inc</strong>. (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the www.intisab.net website and the application Blackjack VR (hereinafter referred to as the “Service”). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal Information as well as game related information we receive from users of Blackjack. We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving the game. By playing Blackjack, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our practices regarding the collection and treatment of your information. Do not play Blackjack unless you consent to the collection, maintenance and use of your information as described in this privacy policy.</p>



<p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>



<p>We may collect personal information from you in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law. How we collect personal information and our policies governing its use, deletion and disclosure are described in this privacy policy. “Personal information” refers to any information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, address, voice, IP address, “personal data”, etc. (as that term is defined Article 4(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation), other identifiers by which you may be contacted online or offline, and other similar types of information under applicable law. Additionally, “Personal information” may include some non-personal information when it is linked with other types of personal information or non-personal information (e.g., motion sensor information or motion tracker information).</p>



<p>When you play Blackjack, we may collect information from you in the following ways:</p>



<p><strong>Information from Third Party Platforms.</strong> We may automatically receive your personal information from the platform through which you downloaded and play the Game (e.g. Oculus). Personal Information collected by the third-party platform that you use to access the Game is subject to the applicable third-party terms of use and/or privacy policy (for more information, please see the Oculus Privacy Policy). For instance, when you first play the Game using the Oculus store, your Oculus ID will automatically be transmitted to us, with no action on your part.&nbsp; Our use of your personal information collected through the Game is limited to the purposes described in the “How We Use Your Information” section below.</p>



<p><strong>Revealing personal information in Blackjack.</strong> You may choose to reveal personal information in the game through multiplayer chat or other public functions, including through your username. In addition to being accessible to other users of the game with whom you are interacting, we may also capture this information using recording functions that we use to monitor users’ activity in the game. We cannot control how other users will use personal information that you reveal using multiplayer chat or other public functions, so, if you reveal personal information through multiplayer chat or other public functions, you are doing so at your own risk. Similarly, users must not create a username that reflects their own real name or reveals personal information. If you include personal information in your display name, you are doing so at your own risk.</p>



<p><strong>Cookies</strong>.<strong> </strong>We may use cookies in connection with automatic data collection through the Website. A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Website. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system may issue cookies when you access the Website.</p>



<p><strong>Data Processing</strong></p>



<p>All information that you provide to us is stored on secured servers located in the United States of America. No matter where you are, you consent to the processing and transferring of your information, including personal information, in and to the United States of America and other countries. Laws that apply to the collection, maintenance and use of information in the United States of America (or any other country) may not be as comprehensive or strict as the laws of the country where you’re located.</p>



<p><strong>Use of Personal Data</strong></p>



<p>Some jurisdictions may require us to describe our legal bases for using or disclosing personal data that we may possess. Where such laws apply, our legal bases for processing personal data are as follows:</p>

<p>Our policy is to use your information in a way that is consistent with and subject to this privacy policy.</p>



<p>Where you’ve provided information to us for a specific purpose (<em>e.g.</em>, to help us troubleshoot an issue you’re having with the Service), we’ll use your information in furtherance of that purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Disclosure of your personal information</strong></p>

<p><strong>Data Security</strong></p>



<p>We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. When you directly provide us with personal information, including through registration, we will encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology or similar technologies. We may retain data collected from you, including personal information, to support customer service inquiries and prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of the Terms of Service if your account has been banned or your access to the Services has been disabled for any reason. We may retain your information for as long as is necessary and relevant to your use of the Services and our operations, which may include retaining your information beyond the end of your use of the Services. To dispose of personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other measures we deem to be appropriate. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through the Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures used in the Services.</p>



<p><strong>Data Subject Rights</strong></p>

<p>Users may withdraw any consent they have provided us to process their personal information. Exercise of any of the rights listed in this section usually doesn’t apply retroactively from the date of the request and doesn’t affect our ability to continue processing information lawfully. Note that the rights enumerated in this section have certain limitations and exceptions under applicable law.</p>



<p>If you’d like to exercise any of the data subject rights described in this section, please reach out to us by email at nauman@intisab.net. We may use your personal information to verify your identity before acting on your request.</p>



<p>Lastly, users will always have the right to lodge a complaint about our privacy practices with the appropriate supervisory authority. However, we’d much rather you contact us first, so we can try to address any concerns that you have about our privacy practices.</p>



<h2><strong>CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h2>



<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time, so please review it frequently. We will post any new or updated privacy policy on our Website, make the new privacy policy accessible in Blackjack and attempt to notify you by email using the email address provided to us through the registration process, if applicable.</p>
