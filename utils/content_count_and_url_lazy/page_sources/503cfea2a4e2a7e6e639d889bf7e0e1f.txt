<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>Updated: August 30, 2022</p>

<p>Protecting your privacy is a high priority to us. We hope that the following statement helps you understand how Sadetta Oy ("we, us, our") processes, uses and safeguards your personal information in context of Premium Bowling ("The Game").</p>

<p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. You should consult this privacy policy regularly for any changes.</p>

<h2>1. Information Processing for Premium Bowling</h2>

<p>At the heart of personal data protection in regards of The Game is the principle of data minimisation. We only collect data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed. The following subsections explain what data is processed in relation to Premium Bowling.</p>

<p><b>Game Data</b></p>

<p>Game Data consists of Player Account Data and High Scores Data. Game Data is exchanged between The Game client that is running in player's device, and our servers. Game data is transmitted via internet using encrypted HTTPS requests from client to server. We process and persist Game Data to be able to create a continuous gaming experience across multiple gaming sessions and devices for our players. In order to be able to create this type of continuous experience, we require every player of The Game to give consent for processing their Game Data before we allow access to The Game.</p>

<p><b>Player Account Data</b> contains Player's credentials, Player's Game State and list of Player's Friends from the platform from which The Game installation was obtained from. Player's Credentials identify the player's account in the store platform from which The Game installation was obtained from and allow our server to identify a player account as an existing player of The Game when a player initiates a game session from a new device or after reinstalling The Game. This allows playing The Game with one Player Account from many devices. Game State allows the player to continue game on another device or after reinstallation, instead of starting anew. List of friends makes it possible for The Game to identify player's friends who are playing The Game and to make it easy for the player to set up games with friends.</p>

<p><b>High Scores Data</b> allows players to compete on high score lists in The Game. Most High Scores Data is sent directly from The Game client to the server after finishing a game while some High Scores Data is generated on the server. Example of generated High Scores Data is weekly player rankings, which takes last week's ranking score and best scores from the client as input and calculates a new aggregated ranking score based on them.</p>

<p>

    </p><ul>
        <li>Player ID that is allocated by us and uniquely identifies the Player Account in scope of The Game.</li>

<p>Online Game is a feature that allows players to interact and play together using internet and our server as the means of connecting players. Online Game Data is exchanged between game clients and our server to be able to make this possible and playing online requires a steady stream of Online Game Data to flow between The Game client and our server. Online Game Data contains Player Data of players who have Online Game feature enabled, as well as real time data such as current activity of the player, position and pose of the player's avatar, position and rotation of player's ball and all player's pins and events such as collisions and scores. Online Game Data is not saved to long term storage at all.</p>

Voice data consists of voice over ip data packets that are sent from The Game client to our server and then relayed by our server to clients that are receiving that communication. Voice chat data is not saved to long term storage at all.</p> 

<p><b>Meta Avatar Data</b></p>

<p>The Game client uses Meta Avatars for representing players in the virtual environment. All players can choose their representation from a selection of Meta Avatar presets while players from Meta Platform can create a customized Meta Avatar to represent theirselves accross multiple applications. Custom Meta Avatar is configured using Avatar Editor in Meta's Platform and the related configuration data is stored and managed in the Meta Platform by Meta Platforms, Inc. The Game client retrieves Meta Avatar Data regarding custom avatars from Meta's Content Delivery Network by using internet as the medium, to be able to show custom Meta Avatars.</p>

<p>The Game client identifies its owner to Meta's Content Delivery Network while retrieving Custom Meta Avatar data. Player's Meta User Account is used for players from Meta Platform and a Federated Meta User Account is created for players from other platforms. The Federated Meta User is created only for the purpose of retrieving Meta Avatar Data and it doesn't contain any personal information about the owner.</p>
