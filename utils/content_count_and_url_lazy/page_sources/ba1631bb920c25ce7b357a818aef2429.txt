            <div class="news_text"><h2>1. Data collection in our games</h2> <p>Automated collection and analysis of user data takes place in our games exclusively in connection with technical     support.</p> <h3>Automated crash reports</h3> <p>In case of a program crash in one of our games, the respective game sends a limited crash dump to our servers. These     crash dumps are aggregated and anonymized. They are only used to report crashes, to analyze memory dumps and as a     result to improve our games and are not stored beyond that.</p> <p>Depending on the game used, the user can disable the automatic transmission of crash dumps. In the case of "X4:     Foundations", this is possible via "Settings &gt; Privacy Settings" in the game menu.</p> <h3>Personalised crash reports</h3> <p>If you enable the "Personalised crash reports" option in the privacy settings of our game "X4: Foundations", all     crash reports sent to Egosoft will contain additional information that will help us contact you. It is not necessary     to enable this setting unless you have been asked to do so by the Egosoft support team. If you enable this setting,     the additional information may help determine the causes of crashes on your computer. This additional information is     used solely for the purpose of identifying and fixing the underlying cause of crashes.</p> <h3>DXDiag and Vulkan Info</h3> <p>In some cases (especially when determining the cause of a crash), Egosoft Support may request a so-called DXDiag and     Vulkaninfo from the user. This data contains detailed information about the system environment and is used to verify     driver/hardware configurations and determine the root cause of problems, respectively. These logs may contain     information that could be considered personal, such as the user's own computer name, in addition to primarily     technical information. Egosoft will only use the provided information to fix the crash problem. If you do not want     to share such information with Egosoft, make sure to filter it out before sending it.</p> <h3>Third-party stores</h3> <p>We offer our games through online stores, including Steam, GOG, Oculus, among others. Purchasing our games from an     online store generally requires that you have an account with that store. Registration of a store account and use of     those stores is subject to the terms of use and privacy policy applicable to that particular store, which may change     from time to time.</p> <p>If you access our games through such a third-party store or distribution platform, those third-party stores may     perform their own analytics. This is outlined in the respective store's privacy policy:</p> <ul>     <li>Steam: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/</a></li>     <li>GOG: <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/212632109-Privacy-Policy?product=gog" target="_blank">https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/212632109-Privacy-Policy?product=gog</a></li>     <li>Oculus: <a href="https://www.oculus.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">https://www.oculus.com/legal/privacy-policy/</a></li>     <li>Gamersgate: <a href="https://www.greenmangaming.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">https://www.gamersgate.com/privacy-policy/</a></li>     <li>Green Man Gaming: <a href="" target="_blank">https://www.greenmangaming.com/privacy-policy/</a></li>     <li>Gamesplanet: <a href="https://us.gamesplanet.com/legal_terms#privacy" target="_blank">https://us.gamesplanet.com/legal_terms#privacy</a></li> </ul> <p>The stores through which we distribute our games allow us to view and download data on sales and performance     measurement of our games. This data is provided to us in aggregate and anonymous form only. We are not able to     associate this aggregated and anonymized data with specific users of our games.</p><br> <h2>2.

Data collection on our website</h2> <h3>5.1 Cookies</h3> <p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help     make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your     computer and saved by your browser.</p> <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies."

Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies     under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.     Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p> <p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such     as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO.

The product is a free and open source,     web-based bug tracking system (<a href="https://www.mantisbt.org/index.php" target="_blank">https://www.mantisbt.org/index.php</a>).</p> <p>Mantis is used as a bug-tracker, which can be accessed by players who have been granted such access to report     bugs/issues in our products.     The service is reachable at <a href="https://mantisbt.egosoft.com" target="_blank">https://mantisbt.egosoft.com/</a>.</p> <p>When you visit this area of our webpage, certain data is transmitted automatically by your browser and generated on     our server (i.e. IP address, time of accessing the page, the actual page in the bug-tracker you visited, etc.). This     data is stored on the server (i.e. for the purpose to analyze/detect errors and to prevent/detect unauthorized     access to the platform). Please refer to section 5.2 for related details.</p> <p>Data transmission is performed using SSL or TLS encryption (please refer to section 3: "SSL or TLS encryption") and     therefore is protected (according to the current state of the technology) against eavesdropping by 3rd-parties (so     called man-in-the-middle attacks).</p> <p>For a selected group of users, we provide dedicated user accounts (under NDA). If such an account is used, any     contribution made     in Mantis is associated with the corresponding account. As part of the user account we also store the user's     e-mail-address as well as (optionally) the user's real name. When being granted a dedicated user account, the user     explicitly acknowledges and agrees to allow the processing and usage of the data he provides when using his account.     Like the anonymously contributed data, this data is stored indefinitely and part of it is publicly visible.</p> <p>Data transmitted to Mantis is anonymized automatically to such an extent as is technically feasible     (i.e. potentially contained IP addresses, usernames, and passwords are extracted from the logs or one-way hashed     prior     to it being transmitted). However, it cannot be ruled out completely that some personal information may be missed by     the algorithm.     If this happens, this data is not used by Mantis and also not transmitted to 3rd parties.</p> <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) (explicit consent of the subject) and/or (f) (legitimate interest of the     webpage operator) DSGVO.</p> <p>For more information about MantisBT privacy policy, please refer to the following link: <a href="https://www.mantisbt.org/         privacy.php" target="_blank">https://www.mantisbt.org/privacy.php</a></p> <h3>5.9 Wiki/Documentation Platform</h3> <p>We use Atlassian ConfluenceÂ® (hereinafter "Confluence") on part of our web presence.

If such an account is used, any contribution done     in Confluence is associated with the corresponding account. As part of the user account we also store the user's     e-mail-address as well as (optionally) the user's real name.
