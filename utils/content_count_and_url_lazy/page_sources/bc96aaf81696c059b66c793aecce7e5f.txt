                                <h2>OCWS, Orinox Cloud Web Services Terms of Service</h2>
<p>Posted: 15 February 2017</p>
<p>Effective: 15 February 2017</p>
<p>
    Thanks for using OCWS! These terms of service ("Terms") cover your use and access to our services,
    client software and websites ("Services").
    Your agreement is with SAS ORINOX - 12 route des Fougerays 44110
    CHATEAUBRIANT France - Capital de 176 023€ - RCS Nantes: 507959203.
</p>
<p>
    Our <a href="https://ocws.orinox.com/en/terms">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect and use your information
    while our <a href="https://ocws.orinox.com/en/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> outlines
    your responsibilities when using our Services. By using our Services, you're agreeing to be bound by
    these Terms, our <a href="https://ocws.orinox.com/en/terms">Privacy Policy</a> and
    <a href="https://ocws.orinox.com/en/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. If you're using our Services for
    an organization, you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that organization.
</p>
<h3>Your Digital Asset &amp; Your Permissions</h3>
<p>
    When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your Data Base, 3D model, Laser scan ,
    diagrams,
    drawings, isometrics, datasheet, catalogues, files, content, messages, contacts and so on ("Your Digital
    Asset"). Your Digital Asset is yours. These Terms don't give us any rights to Your Digital Asset except
    for
    the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
</p>
<p>
    We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Digital Asset, backing it up, and sharing it when
    you
    ask us to. Our Services also provide you with features like auto tagging, integrity check, report,
    visualisation, management, document previews, commenting, easy sorting, editing, sharing and searching.
    These and other features may require our systems to access, store and scan Your Digital Asset. You give
    us
    permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties
    we
    work with.
</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Digital Asset</h3>
<p>
    Our Services let you share Your Digital Asset with others, so please think carefully about what you
    share.
</p>
<h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
    You're responsible for your conduct. Your Digital Asset and you must comply with our Acceptable Use
    Policy.
    Content in the Services may be protected by others' intellectual property rights. Please don't copy,
    upload,
    download or share content unless you have the right to do so.
</p>
<p>
    We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these <a href="https://ocws.orinox.com/en/terms">Terms</a>
    and our <a href="https://ocws.orinox.com/en/acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.
    With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We aren't responsible for the content people post and
    share via the Services.
</p>
<p>
    Help us keep you informed and Your Digital Asset protected. Safeguard your password to the Services, and
    keep your account information current. Don't share your account credentials or give others access to
    your
    account.
</p>
<p>
    You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and
    regulations.
    Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people under the age of 18. By using
    our
    Services, you are representing to us that you're over 18.
</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>
    Some of our Services allow you to download client software ("Software") which may update automatically.
    So
    long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable
    license
    to use the Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the Software may be
    offered under an open source license, we'll make that license available to you and the provisions of
    that
    license may expressly override some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by
    law,
    you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing
    so.
</p>
<h3>Beta Services</h3>
<p>
    We sometimes release products and features that we are still testing and evaluating. Those Services have
    been marked beta, preview, early access, or evaluation (or with words or phrases with similar meanings)
    and
    may not be as reliable as OCWS's other services, so please keep that in mind.
</p>
<h3>Our properties</h3>
<p>
    The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. These Terms don't grant you any
    right,
    title or interest in the Services, others' content in the Services, OCWS and ORINOX trademarks, logos
    and
    other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments or suggestions without any
    obligation to you.
</p>
<h3>Copyright</h3>
<p>
    We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We respond to notices of alleged
    copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our
    Copyright
    Policy. We reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate
    accounts of
    repeat infringers. Our designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:
</p>
<p>
    Copyright Agent
    SAS ORINOX
    12 route des Fougerays
    44110 CHATEAUBRIANT France
    copyright@orinox.com
</p>
<h3>Paid Accounts</h3>
<p>
    Billing. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account
    into a "Paid Account"). We'll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on
    each
    periodic renewal until cancellation. If you're on an annual plan, we'll send you a notice email
    reminding
    you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date.
    You're
    responsible for all applicable taxes, and we'll charge tax when required to do so. Some countries have
    mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn't override these laws.
    No Refunds. You may cancel your OCWS Paid Account at any time. Refunds are only issued if required by
    law.
</p>
<p>
    For example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account
    subscriptions
    within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to or renewing a Paid Account.
</p>
Downgrades. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms. If
you don't pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to
free space levels.
<p></p>
<p>
    Changes. We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a
    message to
    the email address associated with your account.
</p>
<h3>OCWS Teams</h3>
<p>
    Email address. If you sign up for a OCWS account with an email address provisioned by your organization,
    your organization may be able to block your use of OCWS until you transition to an account on a OCWS
    team
    (e.g., OCWS Business plans or OCWS Education) or you associate your OCWS account with a personal email
    address.
</p>
<p>
    Using OCWS Teams. If you join a OCWS team, you must use it in compliance with your organization's terms
    and
    policies. Please note that OCWS team accounts are subject to your organization's control. Your
    administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your OCWS
    team
    account. They may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a OCWS team account. If you
    convert
    an existing OCWS account into part of a OCWS team, your administrators may prevent you from later
    disassociating your account from the OCWS team.
</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>
    You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
    access
    to the Services with notice to you if:
</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>(a) you're in breach of these Terms,</li>
    <li>(b) you're using the Services in a manner that would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or
        other users,
        or
    </li>
    <li>(c) you don't have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We'll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to
    remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Digital
    Asset from our Services. If after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we'll terminate
    or
    suspend your access to the Services.
</p>
<p>
    We won't provide notice before termination where:
</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>(a) you're in material breach of these Terms,</li>
    <li>(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our
        other
        users, or
    </li>
    <li>(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discontinuation of Services</h3>
<p>
    We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond OCWS's control
    or
    to comply with a legal requirement. If we do so, we'll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can
    export Your Digital Asset t from our systems. If we discontinue Services in this way before the end of
    any
    fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we'll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but
    haven't received Services for.
</p>
<h3>Services "AS IS"</h3>
<p>
    We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee. TO THE
    FULLEST
    EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OCWS AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY
    WARRANTIES
    OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some places don't allow the
    disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>
    WE DON'T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO—THIS INCLUDES ANY
    LIABILITY FOR OCWS'S OR ITS AFFILIATES' FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES.
    IN
    COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN'T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR
    LOSSES
    AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR
    OUR
    BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU. THIS PARAGRAPH DOESN'T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR
    LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.
</p>
<p>
    IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, OCWS, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS
    OR
    DISTRIBUTORS WON'T BE LIABLE FOR:
</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>i. ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR</li>
    <li>ii. ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT OCWS OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES
    HAS
    BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p>
<p>
    IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, OCWS, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS
    OR
    DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTION,
    OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. OCWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER
    ONLINE
    OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.
</p>
<p>
    OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT
    OUR
    LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE
    PLAN
    WITH OCWS.
</p>
<h3>Resolving Disputes</h3>
<p>
    Let's Try To Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal
    case.
    Before filing a claim against OCWS, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting
    dispute-notice@orinox.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a
    dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or OCWS may bring a formal proceeding.
</p>
<p>
    Judicial forum for disputes. You and ORINOX agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims
    relating to
    these Terms or the Services will be brought in France, state courts of Nantes, subject to the mandatory
    arbitration provisions below. Both you and ORINOX consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such
    courts.
</p>
<h3>Controlling Law</h3>
<p>
    These Terms will be governed by France law except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some
    countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by
    the
    local laws of the consumer's country. This paragraph doesn't override those laws.
</p>
<h3>Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>
    These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ORINOX with respect to the subject matter of
    these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and
    conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party
    beneficiary
    rights.
</p>
<h3>Waiver, Severability &amp; Assignment</h3>
<p>
    ORINOX’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is
    found
    unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term
    will
    be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights under
    these Terms, and any such attempt will be void. ORINOX may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or
    subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.
</p>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>
    We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:
</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
    <li>(a) changes to the law,</li>
    <li>(b) new regulatory requirements, or</li>
    <li>(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we'll
    notify
    you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your
    account or via an in-product notification. These updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days
    fromwhen we notify you.
</p>
<p>
    If you don't agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective.
    Whereapplicable, we'll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services
    and your account cancellation date. By continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come
    into effect,you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.

<h2>OCWS, Orinox Cloud Web Services Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Posted: 15 February 2017</p>
<p>Effective: 15 February 2017</p>
Thanks for using OCWS. Here we describe how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our
websites, software and services ("Services").

<h3>What &amp; Why</h3>

We collect and use the following information to provide, improve and protect our Services:

<h3>Account.</h3>
<p>
    We collect, and associate with your account, information such as your name, email address, phone number,
    payment info, physical address and account activity. Some of our Services let you access your accounts
    and your information with other service providers.
</p>

<h3>Services.</h3>
<p>
    Our Services are designed to make it simple for you to store Your Digital Asset, collaborate with
    others, and work across multiple devices. To make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your
    Digital Asset—like, Data Base, Model, files, messages, comments, and photos—as well as information
    related to it. This related information can be things like your profile information that make it easier
    to collaborate and share Your Digital Asset with others. Our Services provide you with different options
    for sharing Your Digital Asset.
    You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to do things like share and
    collaborate on Your Digital Asset, send messages, and invite others to use the Services. If you do,
    we'll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.
</p>

<h3>Usage.</h3>
<p>
    We collect information relating to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account
    (such as sharing, editing, viewing and moving files or folders). This helps us provide you with features
    like the "Events" page and version history.
    We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes
    things like IP addresses, the type of browser and device you use, the web page you visited before coming
    to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their settings)
    may also transmit location information to the Services.
</p>

<h3>Cookies and other technologies.</h3>
<p>
    We use technologies such as cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our
    Services.
    For example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit,
    understanding
    how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information. You can set
    your
    browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services. If our systems
    receive a
    DNT:1 signal from your browser, we'll respond to that signal as outlined here.
    With whom
    We may share information as discussed below, but we won't sell it to advertisers or other third parties.
</p>
<h3>Others working for OCWS.</h3>
<p>
    OCWS uses certain trusted third parties (for example, providers of customer support and IT services) to
    help
    us provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services. These third parties will access your information
    only to perform tasks on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy, and we'll remain responsible
    for
    their handling of your information per our instructions.
</p>

<h3>Other users.</h3>
<p>
    Our Services display information such as your name, profile picture and email address
    to other users in places like your user profile and sharing notifications. When you register your OCWS
    account with an email address on a domain owned by your employer or organisation, we may help
    collaborators
    find you and your team by making some of your basic information – such as your name, team name, profile
    picture and email address – visible to other users on the same domain. This helps us show you teams you
    can
    join, and helps other users share files and folders with you.
    Certain features let you make additional information available to others.
</p>

<h3>Other applications.</h3>
<p>
    You can also give third parties access to your information and account, for
    example via OCWS APIs. Just remember that their use of your information will be governed by their
    privacy
    policies and terms.
</p>

<h3>OCWS team admins.</h3>
<p>
    If you are a user of a OCWS team (e.g. OCWS Business plans or OCWS Education),
    your administrator may have the ability to access and control your OCWS team account. Please refer to
    your
    organisation's internal policies if you have questions about this. If you are not a OCWS team user but
    interact with a OCWS team user (by, for example, joining a shared folder or accessing Digital Asset
    shared
    by that user), members of that organisation may be able to view the name, email address, profile picture
    and
    IP address that was associated with your account at the time of that interaction.
</p>

<h3>Law &amp; order.</h3>
<p>
    We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure
    is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily
    injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of OCWS or our users; or (d) protect OCWS's property rights.
    Stewardship of your data is critical to us and a responsibility that we embrace. We believe that our
    users'
    data should receive the same legal protection regardless of whether it's stored on our Services or on
    their
    home computer's hard drive. We'll abide by the following Government Request Principles when receiving,
    scrutinising and responding to government requests (including national security requests) for our users'
    data:

<h3>Security.</h3>
<p>
    We have a team dedicated to keeping your information secure and testing for
    vulnerabilities. We also continue to work on features to keep your information safe in addition to
    things
    like two-factor authentication, encryption of files at rest, and alerts when new devices and apps are
    linked
    to your account.
</p>

<h3>Retention.</h3>
<p>
    We'll retain information you store on our Services for as long as we need it to provide
    you with the Services. If you delete your account, we'll also delete this information. But please note:
    (1)
    there might be some latency in deleting this information from our servers and backup storage; and (2) we
    may
    retain this information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce
    our
    agreements. You can access your personal information by logging in to your OCWS account. Learn more
    here.
</p>

<h4>Where</h4>
<p>
    Around the world. To provide you with the Services, we may store, process and transmit information
    around the world – including outside your country. Information may also be stored locally on the devices
    you use to access the Services.
</p>

<h4>Changes</h4>
<p>
    If we are involved in a reorganisation, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your information may
    be
    transferred as part of that deal. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address
    associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.
    We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post the most current version on our
    website.
    If a revision meaningfully reduces your rights, we will notify you.
</p>
