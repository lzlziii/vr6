					<p>
						Fantastic Contraption was originally a building game made way back in 2008. Millions of people played it obsessively and saved over 12 million contraptions. You can <a href="/original/">still play it</a> for free. For years we loved the idea of a 3d Fantastic Contraption but couldn't figure out how it would work. Then we tried the Vive.
						<br><br>
						The new Fantastic Contraption has been designed from the ground up for room-scale VR. Imagine walking around a grassy island in the sky while you build a machine the size of a horse with your own hands. Press play and watch it trundle off to reach the goal on the other side of the island. With 40+ levels and infinite solutions, it's a VR experience you and your friends will play for hours.
						<br><br>
						Fantastic Contraption was a launch title bundled with the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/widget/386690/">HTC Vive</a> and is also available for <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/922076897882360/">Oculus Touch</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/fantastic-contraption/cid=UP0551-CUSA07387_00-FCNA000000000001">PS VR</a>.

							<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html">Adobe has announced</a> they’ll stop updating the Flash player on December 31, 2020.

It’s been used in schools and has inspired folks to become engineers and game developers. After its initial release in 2008, there was a mobile version (retired), a sequel, a spinoff (unreleased), a spiritual successor (also unreleased), <i>another</i> spiritual successor (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230150/Incredipede/">Incredipede</a>), and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/386690/Fantastic_Contraption/">2016 VR evolution</a>.</p>

							<p>12 February 2018, 5:54 pm</p>
							<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic Contraption version 2.0 is now live! Happy Valentine’s day, Neko loves you!</span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-232 aligncenter" src="http://radialgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/newFeatureArt.png" alt="" width="616" height="353" srcset="http://radialgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/newFeatureArt.png 616w, http://radialgames.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/newFeatureArt-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been working on this update for a year now, and we’re excited(/relieved) to finally get it into your hands. This version is packed with new content, new features, and a ton of back-end improvements, but first:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CHEAPER</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Version 2.0 comes with a 33% permanent price drop. Fantastic Contraption is now available for $19.99USD everywhere!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing has always been something we’ve had to approach carefully. As we were a launch title for the first commercially-available VR, there was no data on what was appropriate or expected from consumers. Now that the market has settled down a bit, we think that $20 or so is fair for everyone and in line with expectations. And if you buy now, you’ll essentially have $10 you didn’t before! That’s like… a pizza! A… a small pizza, but a pizza! You’ll be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">losing </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">free</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">money if you don’t buy today!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BIGGER</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOUBLE THE LEVELS!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve put a ton of work into our puzzle-set and have created a whole new “B-Side” playlist for you to enjoy! The game now boasts over 100 levels, smoothing out the introductory learning curve and adding some high-end challenges for those Contraptionistas that find the late-game too easy. Share your new solutions! Show us what you’ve got!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>FASTER</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic Contraption 2.0 runs faster on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> machine now!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve been making separate versions of Fantastic Contraption for different platforms, as each new piece of hardware had different technical requirements or minimum specs. Gameplay is the same between all platforms if you have the latest and greatest hardware, but what if you don’t have a supercomputer with a dedicated AC room? We’ve put a bunch of probably-disqualifying performance-enhancing code into each edition of the game to make it sing uniquely for each platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we’ve done in Version 2.0 is merge all of our performance fixes into one master build. This means that if you have a computer that is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">below </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">min-spec on any platform, you should still be able to play without our physics engine grinding your CPU to dust! This also means that if your CPU is heavily loaded with other tasks (Twitch streaming, mixed-reality compositing, etc.) the game will keep chugging along at a comfortable 90+ FPS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This required us to rework how </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">physics </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">work so if reality starts falling apart for you, maybe try RAMing some CPUs onto your DVD-ROMs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>STRONGER</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic Contraption has been hitting up the gym every week and is really starting to show some progress! It’s been simultaneously doing low- and high-carb diets and the results are amazing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But also, now that you’ve made it this far down in the update news, I’ve got a secret to let you in on. All those dirty article-skimmers won’t know about this, but those B-Sides levels? They also include a handful of levels featuring all-new gameplay mechanics: Cactuses (that destroy bits of your contraption on touch) and Balloons (that give your Contraption buoyancy to float over Cactuses, gaps, and other challenges).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These new elements aren’t a big part of this update; they’re little teasers we’ve thrown in, things that we’ve been working on since version 1.0, way back when VR was just a baby. They’re just two fun toys in a whole toolbox of things that were cut for the initial version of the game. You can access these new elements in the Level Editor though – so you can generate (and share online) all sorts of zany things for the world to see!</span></p>

PS VR and Microsoft Store contraptionistas: You are also getting the 2.0 update! It’s all done on our end, we’re just waiting for their quality control inspectors to finish going over it all with a fine-toothed-magnifying-glass. That’s a thing, right?</p>							<br style="clear:both;">

Imagine! We redesigned the gameplay experience especially for PS VR, taking advantage of the likelihood that you have a favorite place to relax in front of your PlayStation 4. We’ve included special PS VR-only features that allow you to resize and position your gameworld at the press of a button, which we’re sure you’ll find slick and amazing.</p>
<p>It has fast become my favorite way to play, and makes contraption-building feel a whole lot like model-making, which we are Very Big Fans of here at Radial Games.</p>
<h2>New, Unique Levels for PlayStation VR</h2>

<p>We have a handful of brand-new, PlayStation-exclusive levels in the release. Try your hand bouncing around some moguls, attacking a big-bricked wall, and more! We’ve designed a few challenges specifically around seated play, and we know you’ll enjoy them.</p>
<h2>Dynamically Resize the Entire World in the Brand-New Resize Island</h2>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 57%;"><iframe loading="lazy" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;" src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/ScratchyIckyGentoopenguin" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>Welcome to Resize Island, where you can dynamically resize the entire world around you! This opens a world of customization for your preferred way to play. You can make the world really huge to fit your standing-style gameplay preferences, or shrink it all the way down to fit on your lap, where you can marvel at tiny Neko. That’s right, THE CAT RESIZES TOO. You can do anything in videogames.</p>
