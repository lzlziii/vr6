            <h4>1. General</h4>
            <p>At VirtualSpeech, we respect your privacy rights, so we have prepared this privacy policy (our "Privacy Policy") to explain how we collect, use and share your data. By using or accessing the Service (VirtualSpeech Website or Application), you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may update our Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices.</p>
            <h4 class="p-t">What information this Privacy Policy covers</h4>
            <p>The purpose of this Privacy Notice is to describe how VirtualSpeech collects, uses, and shares information about you through our online interfaces (e.g., websites and mobile applications) owned and controlled by us, including but not limited to VirtualSpeech.com (referred to herein as the "Site"). Please read this Privacy Notice carefully to understand what we do. If you do not understand any aspects of our Privacy Notice, please feel free to <a target="_blank" href="https://virtualspeech.com/contact">contact us</a>. Your use of our Site is also governed by our Terms of Use.</p>
            <h4 class="p-t">Information we collect</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Information relating to your use of our Site</b>. When users come to our Site, we may track, collect, and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited, and which hyperlinks were clicked. We also collect information from the URLs from which you linked to our Site. Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system, and browser software used by each user of the Site. We may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of their point of connectivity. Location data may be used to route your traffic to the nearest regional server to reduce latency and improve your experience. We may also use cookies and web beacons when you visit our Site.</li>
                <li><b>Personal Data provided directly by you or via third parties</b>. We collect Personal Data that you provide to us when you register for an account, update or change information for your account, purchase products or Services, complete a survey, sign-up for email updates, send us email messages, and/or participate in other Services on our Site. We may use the Personal Data that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific Services you select, send you updates about Content Offerings or other VirtualSpeech events, and send you email messages about Site maintenance or updates.</li>
                <li><b>Account Registration</b>. If you register for an account on our Site, you may be required to provide us with Personal Data such as your name and email address.</li>
                <li><b>Updates</b>. VirtualSpeech may offer you the ability to receive updates either via email or by posting on portions of the Site only accessible to registered users. In order to subscribe to these Services, you may be required to provide us with Personal Data such as your name and email address.</li>
                <li><b>Communications with VirtualSpeech</b>. We may receive Personal Data when you send us an email message or otherwise contact us.</li>
                <li><b>Surveys</b>. We may receive Personal Data when you provide information in response to a survey operated by us or a Content Provider.</li>
                <li><b>Third Party Payment Processing</b>. VirtualSpeech provides you with the ability to pay for Services using a credit card or other methods through a third party payment processing service provider. Please note that our service provider – not VirtualSpeech – collects and processes your financial information.</li>
            </ul>





            <h4 class="p-t">Use of information obtained by VirtualSpeech</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Information relating to your use of our Site</b>. VirtualSpeech may use or share aggregate or anonymous data collected through the Application for purposes such as understanding or improving the Application. This includes, for example, time in our VR app, time in specific virtual rooms, which online course modules are completed. This does not include any audio recordings or uploaded presentations.</li>
                <li><b>Personally Identifiable Information provided directly by you or via third parties</b>. Except as set forth in this Privacy Notice or as specifically agreed to by you, VirtualSpeech will not disclose any of your Personal Data. In addition to the other uses set forth in this Privacy Notice, we may disclose and otherwise use Personal Data as described below.</li>
                <li><b>Providing the Site and our Services</b>. We use Personal Data which you provide to us in order to allow you to access and use the Site and in order to provide any information, products, or Services that you request from us.</li>
                <li><b>Technical support and security</b>. We may use Personal Data to provide technical support to you, where required, and to ensure the security of our Services and the Site.</li>
                <li><b>Updates</b>. We use Personal Data collected when you sign-up for our various email or update services to send you the messages in connection with the Site or Content Offerings. We may also archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you, where we are legally entitled to do so.</li>
                <li><b>Government Authorities; Legal Rights and Actions</b>. VirtualSpeech may share your Personal Data with various government authorities in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes; to establish or exercise our legal rights or to protect our property; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. We also may share your Personal Data when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of VirtualSpeech, the Site, our users, customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.</li>

            </ul>

            <h4 class="p-t">Request or delete your data</h4>
            <p>To request the user data collected on you, or if you want us to delete the data collected on you, please contact: info@virtualspeech.com</p>

            <h4 class="p-t">Sharing your personally-identifiable information with third parties</h4>
            <p>We may be required to disclose personally-identifiable information in response to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, we may share account or other personally-identifiable information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the VirtualSpeech name, or to prevent imminent harm. This may include sharing personally-identifiable information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
            <h4 class="p-t">External links</h4>
            <p>For your convenience we may provide links to sites operated by organizations other than VirtualSpeech ("Third Party Sites") that we believe may be of interest to you. We do not disclose your Personal Data to these Third Party Sites unless we have a lawful basis on which to do so. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Sites. If you choose to click on a link to one of these Third Party Sites, you should review the privacy policy posted on the other site to understand how that Third Party Site collects and uses your Personal Data.</p>
            <h4 class="p-t">Information security</h4>
            <p>We consider the confidentiality and security of your information to be of the utmost importance. We will use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures to keep your Personally Identifiable Information confidential and secure and will not share it with third parties, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, or unless such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, as permitted by applicable law. Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that email communications are typically not encrypted and should not be considered secure.</p>
            <p>VirtualSpeech hold your personal data securely in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018, under which it is fully registered.</p>

            <h4 class="p-t">Do not track</h4>
            <p>The Service is not designed to respond to "do not track" signals sent by some browsers.</p>
            <h4 class="p-t">Contact us</h4>
            <p>To understand more about our Privacy Policy, access your information, or ask questions about our privacy practices or issue a complaint, please <a target="_blank" href="https://virtualspeech.com/contact">contact us</a></p>
