            <h1>Out of the Shadows Privacy Policy - April 15th, 2021</h1>

            <p>
                This policy applies to both our website and our game, "Out of the Shadows". We created this Privacy Policy to inform you about what information we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. Our Privacy Policy explains: What information we collect and why we collect it. How we use that information. The choices we offer, including how to access and update information. Weâ€™ve tried to keep it as simple as possible. Your privacy matters to us.
            </p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <p>
                We do not collect or store any information about our users.
            </p>

            <h2>Information we share</h2>

            <p>
                We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals unless you provide your consent or there is a legal reason to do so. However, we are not intentionally gathering or storing any user data.
            </p>

            <h2>Information security</h2>

            <p>
                We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not require users to create an account and our game does not require an internet connection nor does it gather or transmit any information whether connected or not connected to the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
                We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
            </p>

            <h2>Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</h2>

            <p>
                We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.
                Changes to our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
