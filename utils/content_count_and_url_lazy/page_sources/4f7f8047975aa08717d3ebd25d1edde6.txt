            information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by those third parties
            with whom we may share your personal information (see "Platform-Specific Services" and "WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH
            ANYONE?" above), in the United States or other countries.</p>
        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data
            protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all
            necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and
            applicable law.</p>
        <h2 id="5-how-long-do-we-keep-your-information">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

                purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
            other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
            longer than 1 year.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
            or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
            from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
        <h2 id="6-how-do-we-keep-your-information-safe">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong></em> <em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
                organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
            security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
            information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal,
            or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission
            of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a
            secure environment.</p>

            personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
            authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.
