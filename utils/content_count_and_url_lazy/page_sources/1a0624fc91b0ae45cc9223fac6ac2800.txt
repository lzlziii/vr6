<p>In addition to the information provided above regarding the categories, sources, uses, and sharing of personal information we collect, we are providing the following additional information to California residents consistent with applicable law, including without limitation the California Privacy Rights Act and any implementing regulations adopted thereunder (“CPRA”). &nbsp;Terms (including defined capitalized terms) used in this California section of this Privacy Policy have the same meanings given in the CPRA, unless otherwise defined.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We collect the information described above in this Privacy Policy (including identifiers, commercial information, internet or other electronic network activity, and in certain circumstances Sensitive Personal Information such as account log-in / password, ethnicity, health information, financial account information,&nbsp; social security, driver’s licence, ID or passport number, or specific geolocation data) from fans and consumers (including job applicants), artists, podcast hosts and producers, business partners, clients, vendors, other applications (e.g., social networks), advertising networks and digital service providers. &nbsp;The Personal Information we collect about you will depend upon how you use our Sites or otherwise interact with us. In addition to the categories of data described above, we may collect and/or use additional types of information and will do so after providing notice to you and obtaining your consent to the extent such notice and consent is required by the CPRA.</p>



<p>We may use this information for any of the business purposes described above.&nbsp; We may also share this information with the following categories of third parties: Sony Music and affiliated companies, artists, podcast producers, independent artist and label clients, advertising networks, digital service providers and other business partners for such business purposes.</p>



<p>In addition to the sources and categories of third parties mentioned above, we also may share this information with law enforcement and professional service companies for the limited purposes of addressing our compliance and legal obligations and exercising our legal rights.</p>



<p><strong>California Consumer Rights</strong></p>



<p>Subject to certain exceptions, California residents have the following rights:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Access and portability.</strong>&nbsp; Upon a verifiable request, California residents can request information regarding what personal information we collect, use, disclose or sell and information about our data practices, including the right to request we provide you with the categories and/or specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, and the categories of sources of such personal information and the categories of external recipients to which such personal information is disclosed (but not the individual sources or recipients);<ul><li>Please note, the CPRA’s right to obtain copies does not grant a right to the whole of any document that contains personal information about you, but only to copies of “specific pieces” of such personal information;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>In order to provide specific pieces of information about you, we may require a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal information is the subject of the request.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Deletion.</strong>&nbsp; Request deletion of the personal information we maintain about you;
<ul>
<li>Please note that as part of the verification process, once you submit a request to delete, we may follow up and require you to confirm that you want your information deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Correction.</strong> Request correction of inaccurate personal information we maintain about you;</li>



<li><strong>“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal information”. </strong>Opt out of the “sale” or the “sharing” of your personal information to third parties for cross-contextual behavioural advertising (i.e. targeted advertising), whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may be required to retain some of your personal information, and certain personal information is strictly necessary in order for us to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy; and</li>



<li><strong>Profiling &amp; Automatic Decision-Making. &nbsp;</strong>The right to know and opt out of any form of profiling or automated processing of personal information undertaken to evaluate an individual’s personal aspects and make predictions regarding, for example, their economic situation, health, preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information</strong></p>



<p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties for money.&nbsp; However, Sony Music engages in online advertising practices (and certain analytics or similar activities) whereby we share personal information with other companies and service providers in compliance with the law in order to deliver more meaningful ads and other communications to consumers, and for other similar reasons provided in this Privacy Policy. These practices may be considered a “sale” or “share” for cross-context behavioural advertising as defined in the CPRA.</p>



<p>California residents have the right to opt-out of this information “sale” or “sharing” (as defined in the CPRA).&nbsp; If you wish to exercise this right, please complete the form <a href="https://www.sonymusic.com/ccpa-contact-form/">here</a> or call the following toll-free number: 1-833-380-0676.&nbsp; To the extent that you elect to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, they must select “An Authorized Representative” on the form.&nbsp; We will not share the personal information of California minors who are under the age of 16 with third parties for commercial purposes without affirmative consent, which can be provided at the point of data collection.</p>



<p>To disable sharing through cookies set by third parties that may be considered “sales” or “sharing” under the CPRA, please refer to the “Manage Cookies” link in the cookie banner of the applicable Site.</p>



<p>In addition, the Digital Advertising Alliance also offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CPRA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies.&nbsp; For more information, visit: <a href="https://www.privacyrights.info/">https://www.privacyrights.info/</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Profiling &amp; Automated Processing</strong></p>



<p>We may undertake limited profiling when you interact with our Sites or Community Forums, and when you sign up to receive marketing about Sony Music, our artists, podcasts or products. This may be considered a form of automated processing. It means we might combine the personal information you provide when registering, with information about your activity on our Site(s) and Community Forums, and information collected from other sources as described in this Privacy Policy above; such as your account activity on streaming sites and social media platforms when you connect to our Sites using your streaming or social media account credentials, or your recent transactions on our artist stores. We undertake this type of limited profiling so that we can: personalize marketing content you’ve requested; create more meaningful ads and other communications to consumers; measure our audience and enhance the Sony Music user experience; and for other similar reasons provided above in this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;For example, we might let you know about new releases you may like, or relevant artists’ shows in your city.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This profiling activity will not have a legal or similarly significant effect on consumers, and therefore we do not offer California residents the right to opt-out of such profiling at this time.</p>



<p><strong>Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure </strong><strong>of Sensitive Personal Information</strong></p>



<p>Under the CPRA Regulations, a business must only provide the Right to Limit the Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information when such use does not fall within the list of exceptions outlined in CPRA § 7027, subsection (l). Sony Music’s use and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information falls within this list of exceptions, and we therefore do not offer such opt-out right at this time.</p>



<p><strong>Exercising other California Consumer Rights</strong></p>



<p>If you are a California resident and wish to exercise any of these rights, please: (a) <a href="https://www.sonymusic.com/feedback/">contact us here</a> with the specific nature of your request, referencing “Your California Privacy Rights”; or (b) call the following toll-free number: 1-833-380-0676.&nbsp; When submitting your request, you must affirm that you are a California resident or an authorized representative for a California resident, and provide enough information for us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or their authorized representative. All requests should be properly labelled and contain all the necessary information so that we can understand, evaluate and respond to the request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authorized agents must be registered with the California Secretary of State, and the consumer must designate the authorized agent by providing the authorized agent with a valid power of attorney or written permission to act for the consumer.&nbsp; We will follow up with authorized agents to request this documentation.&nbsp; Such written permission must state the agent’s full legal name, the full legal name of the applicable consumer, and a clear description of the permission granted. Alternatively, an authorized agent may submit a copy of a power of attorney under Probate Code sections 4000-4465. The consumer’s identity, in addition to the authorized agent’s identity, will need to be independently verified for us to be able to fulfill your request. We may also ask the consumer to directly confirm with us that they provided the agent permission to submit the request. &nbsp;If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty or we do not receive adequate proof that you are authorized to act on the consumer’s behalf, we may deny the request.</p>



<p>In respect of Californian residents’ rights of access and portability, deletion and correction, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity based upon the information you provide, and you may be asked to provide additional proof of identification so that we can verify your identity and validate the request. &nbsp;If we cannot verify your identity to a sufficient level of certainty to respond to your request, we will let you know promptly and explain why we cannot verify your identity.&nbsp; Pursuant to the CPRA, we will not require you to verify your identity, beyond asking for the information necessary to complete your request, when you exercise your rights to opt out of the Sharing or Sale of your personal information or to limit the use &amp; disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information (if the same becomes applicable).</p>



<p>Submitting a request under the CPRA does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use any additional information you provide as part of your request to verify your identity. &nbsp;Please note that you are limited by law in the number of requests you may submit per year.&nbsp; We will not discriminate against you by offering you different pricing or products, or by providing you with a different level or quality of products, based solely upon you exercising your rights under the CPRA. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Retention</strong></p>



<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active and as needed to provide you services.&nbsp; We will use and retain your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 provides you the right to receive: (a) information identifying any third party(ies) to whom we may have disclosed, within the preceding calendar year, your personal information for that third party’s direct marketing purposes; and (b) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed.&nbsp; To obtain such information free of charge, please write to us at the address below, or submit your request <a href="https://www.sonymusic.com/feedback/">here</a>.
