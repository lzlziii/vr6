					<h3> European Economic Area </h3>
					<p>If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and protections under the law
						regarding the processing of your personal data.</p>
					<h4> Legal Basis for Processing </h4>
					<p>If you are in the EEA, when we process your personal data we will only do so in the following situations:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you.
								For example, we use personal data about you to accurately bill you, to process payments (through
								a third party payments processor) for your use of our Services, and to provide the Service you
								have requested.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data. For example, we may process your
								personal data to communicate with you about changes to our Services, to provide, secure, and
								improve our Services, and to track usage of our Services to better understand how they are being
								used. Additionally, we may use personal data about you to send you promotional communications
								and news about product updates</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>We have your consent to do so. For example, if we intend to change the way we process your
								personal data in a material way or process it for a new purpose, we will request your consent
								before doing so.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>We have a legal obligation to process your personal data. For example, we may need to retain
								certain personal data to comply with our recordkeeping and retention requirements or we may need
								to retain certain sales information to comply with applicable law.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4> Data Subject Requests </h4>
					<p>If you are in the EEA, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your
						personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also have the right to object to, or request
						that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights,
						privacy@normalvr.com. Alternatively, you may contact us as indicated below.</p>

						resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where you reside. For
						contact details of your local Data Protection Authority, please see: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm</a>
