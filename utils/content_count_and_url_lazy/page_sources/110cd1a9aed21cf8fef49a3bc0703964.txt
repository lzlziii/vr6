(“Evernever Games”) respects the privacy of its online visitors and users of its websites, products and services, including communication services, (collectively, the “Services”). We recognize the importance of protecting information collected from our users and have adopted this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we gather, use, process, store and disclose your information, including personal information, in conjunction with your access and use of our Services.</p><p>By using our Services, you confirm that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy. We will not share your personally identifiable information except as described herein.&nbsp;</p><p>1. &nbsp; TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p><p>We collect two basic types of information – personal information and anonymous information – and we may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information, aggregate information. Personal Information means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual’s first and last name, postal address, email address and/or telephone number. Anonymous Information means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual (including an individual’s computing device). Aggregate Information means information about groups or categories of individuals which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may share Aggregate and Anonymous Information with other parties without restriction.</p><p>We collect the following categories of information:</p><ul role="list"><li>Registration information you provide when you create an account, which may include personal data such as: your first name and surname, country of residence, date of birth, email address, username and password.</li><li>Transaction information you provide when you request information or purchase a product or service from us, whether on our sites or through our applications, including identification information, your date of birth, your postal and/or residential address, telephone number and payment information.

Please note that our sites and applications may offer chat, forums, community environments (including multiplayer gameplay) or other tools that do not have a restricted audience. If you provide Personal Information when you use any of these features, that Personal Information may be publicly posted and otherwise disclosed without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party. We do not require our users to include sensitive data (e.g., race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, sexual life or criminal record) in their account. If you choose to post any such data to your account or public forums on our Service, please understand that it is visible to others as noted above. We have no obligation to keep private any sensitive information or personally identifiable information that you have made available to other users or the public using these functions. Information sent either one-to-one or within a limited group using our message, chat, post or similar functionality, where we are permitted by law to collect this information.</li><li>Content, communications and other information you provide to us, view or engage with when you use our sites and applications, our applications on third-party sites or platforms (such as social networking sites) or link your profile from a third-party site or platform to your registered account.

We also record some of this information automatically when you use our Services.&nbsp; We also may receive some of this information from third parties.</p><ul role="list"><li>We collect the types of information as outlined in Section 1 and when you visit our sites or applications, when you register and manage your account, when you use our Services, when you purchase a product or services from us, when you post to public forums or chats, if you send us support inquiries, intellectual property claims or other claims, complaints or inquiries, when you participate in contests or promotions, or when we ask you for information for contractual or legal reasons.</li><li>We collect information through technology, such as cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons and pixel tags), including when you visit our sites and applications or use our applications on third-party sites or platforms. A cookie is a small string of data which often includes an anonymous unique identifier sent to your Internet browser from a website’s computers, which is stored on your computer’s hard drive and is used to customize your use of a product or online site, keep records of your access to an online site or product, or store information needed by you on a regular basis (e.g. password retention functionality).

Each browser is different, so consult the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how you change your cookie preferences. Please note that if you reject all cookies, you may not be able to use certain of our (or other companies’) web pages.</li><li>We participate in ad and/or affiliate networks operated by various third-party companies. These companies collect and may use certain anonymous information about your visits to our Service as a function of referring Internet traffic to our Service. We do not permit these companies to collect any Personal Information about you, however, these companies may collect your IP address. These companies may set and use cookies, web beacons, pixels and other technologies to collect anonymous information about your visits to our Service, and may otherwise aggregate, analyze and anonymize that data. We may permit these companies to collect information from site visitors about their online activities over time and across other websites. If you would like to learn more about these specialized advertising technologies, the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> offers useful information about Internet advertising companies, including <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">information about how to opt-out</a> of certain information collection. You can opt out of interest-based targeting provided by participating ad servers through the Digital Advertising Alliance (<a href="http://youradchoices.com/">http://youradchoices.com</a>).</li><li>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically. Local law may require that you authorize the third party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.</li></ul><p>Please keep in mind that when you provide information to us on a third-party site or platform (for example, through our applications), the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by this Privacy Policy and the information that the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our applications.</p><p>3. &nbsp; USE OF YOUR INFORMATION BY EVERNEVER GAMES</p><p>Evernever Games will be the data controller for your information.
