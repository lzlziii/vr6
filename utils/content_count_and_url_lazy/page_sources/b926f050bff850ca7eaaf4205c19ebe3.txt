<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to use StarMaker (including StarMaker Mobile and StarMaker VR application) &nbsp;(hereafter referred to as “<strong>StarMaker ”,“we” or “us</strong>”), and become a part of our creative community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This Privacy Policy only applies to you if you are NOT a resident in EEA, UK, Switzerland or US. If you are in any of these regions, please refer to StarMaker Privacy Policy (For Users in EEA, UK and Switzerland) or StarMaker Privacy Policy (For Users in US).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the operator of StarMaker, we respect your right to privacy and highly value the protection of your Personal Data. This StarMaker Privacy Policy (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) explains how we collect, process and protect your Personal Data when you use StarMaker and how you can exercise your rights to Personal Data protection. <strong>For information that demands your particular notice and that may have a significant impact on your rights and interests, we have highlighted it in bold font to draw your attention. If you do not agree with this policy, you should not </strong><strong>access or</strong><strong> use the Platform.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Personal Data” in this Privacy Policy refers any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject), including nickname, date of birth, email address, chat history, social account information, your profile photo/audio/video, audio recordings, video recordings, passwords, phone number, device type, log in IP address, log in time record, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>StarMaker has a diverse community of users in various ages. However, in order to protect the privacy and Personal Data of minors, we will obtain parental or legal guardian’s consent where the local laws in your country or region require before processing minors’ Personal Data. Please note, we will limit the types and scope of Personal Data collected from minors as much as possible and also limit the functions available to minors. </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor, please ensure that you have read this Privacy Policy and are responsible for your child's activities before allowing your child to create his or her own StarMaker account and use the application. You are suggested to pay close attention to your child’s use of StarMaker and to ensure that your child only uses the age-appropriate functions.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us using the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="st-privacy-0">1. What types of Personal Data do we collect and our purposes</h2>
<p>The scope of Personal Data we collect depends on the functions of StarMaker you use and how you use these functions. The purposes and types of Personal Data we collect are summarized in the below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A. The Personal Data you directly provide to us</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Registration and Login</u></strong>. If you choose to register for a StarMaker account by email or mobile phone number (if applicable), we may need to collect your basic profile information such as your user nickname, age, avatar, gender, email or mobile phone number. If you refuse to provide such Personal Data, you will not be able to complete the registration process and can only use very limited functions of StarMaker as a visitor. After you have logged in, you may also choose to add additional Personal Data to your personal profile page, such as your birthday, horoscope sign, relationship status, hometown, educational background, occupation, personal tags, etc. to show your personalized image. New users of StarMaker may also log in through a third-party platform account (please refer to Section 1.C below for more information).</p>
<p><strong><u>Creating UGC and Sharing</u></strong>. When you post any user-generated content (“<strong>UGC</strong>”) such as your musical performance or rhythm-based performance or singing composition or news feed (including any content in forms of audio, video, image, text, etc.) within StarMaker, we may need to collect the UGC you post, the time you post, location data, singing records, song list, etc. depending on the specific function you use. When you turn on the [beauty camera] function, we will process your facial image data in the video or live streaming to help you automatically present a better personal image. After you create and post your UGC, we will generate and process data related to your UGC, such the number of your followers and content views. <strong>Please note that some of our</strong> <strong>UGC creating and sharing functions are only available to non-minor users. In order to protect the safety and privacy of minors, we will process the user's facial recognition data during the use of respective functions to ensure that the user is not a minor. Such facial recognition data may constitute special categories of Personal Data (sensitive Personal Data). We will not process such data beyond that specific purpose and we will do our best to ensure the security of your data. </strong>In addition, in order to recommend songs suitable for you and optimize your user experience, we may extract facial image data and/or voice data from your UGC (such as video and/or audio clips) to help StarMaker know your approximate age and gender. Please be assured that we will delete relevant extracted data as soon as we have identified your approximate age and gender, and we will not use such data for other purposes.</p>
<p><strong><u>Identity Authentication</u></strong>. For special categories of users such as celebrities, media artists, and professional singers, we offer an identify authentication service so that the authenticated identity tag can be associated to your account and personal pages. You will need to contact our corporate staff to apply for identity authentication. Depending on the specific circumstances, we may require your photo, phone number and other identity data to complete authentication.</p>
<p><strong><u>Contact and Marketing</u></strong><strong>. </strong>We may use the contact information provided by you (e.g., email address) to conduct user survey or to send you information about products and services that may be of interest to you. Where required by applicable laws and regulations, we will obtain your consent before sending you marketing messages. If you are not interested in such information, you may refuse at any time during the communication, for example, by clicking on the unsubscribe/refuse option or sending us a reply to opt-out.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. The Personal Data provided by you or generated during your use of StarMaker </strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Content Viewing</u></strong>. Any user can view publicly available UGC within StarMaker and you do not need to register a StarMaker account or login to view such UGC, but it is necessary to login with an account of VR distribution platform when you use StarMaker VR.. Whether you are viewing after login or as a visitor, we may collect your browsing history so that you can record and further explore the content you have viewed.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Social Network and Interaction</u></strong>. In order to provide you with a better social network experience and to increase the number of views of your own UGC, we may ask you at login if you provide us with the access to your Contacts on your device so that we can find friends for you within StarMaker community; you may decline to provide us with this access and it will not affect your use of other functions of StarMaker. We may also recommend users that you may wish to follow based on data analysis, and you may decline or turn off our recommendations. If you wish to add friends manually, you may provide us with the user ID of your friend, your location data (by turning on the location access on your device), or a list of friends from a third-party social platforms (e.g., Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter) so that we can find or recommend other users for you. If you use the Creating Rooms function, we may collect the names and tags of the rooms you create. In addition, StarMaker also offers other social network features such as Partner Space, Friendship and Family, which enable you to interact with other users and enjoy StarMaker in your way.</p>
<p><strong><u>Chat and Message</u></strong>. When you use the IM Chat function, we may collect your text chat data and/or voice chat data, depending on the specific method you use.

<h2 class="st-privacy-4">5. How do we protect your Personal Data</h2>
<p><strong>To provide you with a privacy-friendly environment, StarMaker offers a variety of privacy protection features to limit the Personal Data that other users can see, such as: you can set your account to private status and hide your UGC content; you can conceal your friendship space to others; and if you are a VIP user, you can delete the view history after accessing other users’ content or space, and you can hide your followers and information about the people you follow from strangers.

<p><strong>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Data that we collect and process. The measures that we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your Personal Data.</strong> For example, we adopt encryption at rest to secure all user data (including database files and backups) and use security keys for data management.

We will also ensure the effective implementation of these technical measures through code review mechanisms. In addition, we periodically test the applications and systems for vulnerabilities and security issues, and take access control measures such as access tokens and multi-factor authentication to ensure information security.</p>
