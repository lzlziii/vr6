	<p>VR World built the MultiMeasure app as a Commercial app for both private and business use. This SERVICE is provided by VR World and is intended for use as is.</p>
	<p>Our Privacy Policy provides information about how we use your information. MultiMeasure is intended for use “as is” and is provided as a service of VR World. MultiMeasure agrees to and abides by the terms set forth by Meta for Developer Data Use, which can be found at <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/policy/data-use/" target="_blank">https://developer.oculus.com/policy/data-use/</a></p>
	<p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the use of information in relation to this policy.</p>
	<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
	<p><i>MultiMeasure does not collect or store any personal data.</i></p>
	<p>The reason we don't collect data for MultiMeasure is we choose not to. Should this change in the future, this privacy policy shall be updated and you will be notified after updating the app and decide then whether to keep using the application or not.</p>
	<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
	<p>We value your trust which is why we do not collect your personal information in this app.</p>
	<p>This app uses a function called "Passthrough" which enables you to see your real world environment in your headset. MultiMeasure isn't able to see or do anything with this information, such as record. Your real world environment is rendered in your headset and never given to the app itself. For more information, please see Meta's information on this: <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/">https://developer.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-with-passthrough/</a>.</p>
