                        tablet apps), and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed . This
                        includes information related to your past use of our Services, and information about you that is personally
                        identifiable, such as your name, address, email address, IP address, phone number and avatar
                        identity.</span></p>
                <p><span>This Privacy Policy, however, does not apply to the practices of companies that are
                        not affiliated with Innerworld.</span></p>
                <p><span>What Information Do We Collect?</span></p>
                <p><span>We generally act as the data controller of your information. We collect the following
                        types of information.</span></p>

                            “personal information,” or “personal data.” All these terms refer to information
                            that specifically relates to or identifies a particular individual. Personal information also includes
                            information that when linked to other information identifies a specific individual. When you register to
                            use our Services, we ask for a limited amount of personal information, such as your name, selected
                            username, and email address. When you sign into our Services, you are not anonymous to us. Innerworld
                            also collects information about your transactions with us, including information about your use of our

                            after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used
                            by your browser on subsequent visits to our Services. Consult your device's web browser

                <ul>
                    <li><span>We use the information that we collect to operate, maintain,

                <ul>

                            to detect network intrusions and protect you, ourselves or others from malware, fraud, unlawful uses or
                            other illegal activity, or (iii) compliance with various reporting obligations.</span></li>

                            particular, some states require us by law to record and report information regarding the abuse of

                            age, or persons who are in danger of committing suicide. If you convey such circumstances, and provide
                            information that could lead us to identify your name and location, we may have to record such
                            information and provide it to the appropriate authorities.</span></li>

                        through our Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to
                        receive notice of a security breach in writing.</span></p>
