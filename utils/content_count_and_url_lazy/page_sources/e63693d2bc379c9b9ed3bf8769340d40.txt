                (7/26/2023) Lepidotpera is now available on <a style="color:navy" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2491860/Lepidoptera/">Steam</a>! 
            </p>
            <p> (5/11/2023) Australia Update! We just completed our Cook Mountain Australia Level complete with two species of birdwing.  We also included an amazing new feature.  Now every butterfly you identify can be called up from your library and it will land in your hand on command. So now you can examine all your identified butterflies from every level, in any level, more closely, and you can even share them with a friend!</p>
             <p>01/10/23 Great News! Lepidoptera has recently been accepted to the Meta App Lab.
             We are also working on our own ecommerce site to provide secure payment and download for those who like to sideload their VR experience!</p>
            
            <p>Lepidoptera is a multiplayer social adventure where you and your friends can learn about butterflies from specific areas of the world. The first level is set in the Black Hills.  
            There you can take pictures while you find the twenty species of butterfly scattered throughout the level.  You can also rock climb.  The Orca VR social experience means you can connect
            to other users in many ways while always retaining the ability to filter interactions.  Be as social or as solitary as you wish, with the Orca VR Social Experience the metaverse is yours.  Five more levels are planned: Congo, Queensland, Amazon, Azerbaijan, and the Tatra Mountains.
