     <p id="u607-2">Privacy Policy</p>
     <p id="u607-3">&nbsp;</p>
     <p>At Spinview, privacy, data protection, and data security are central to what we do. The introduction of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on 25 May 2018 is an important milestone in raising the bar on transparency and how your data is stored and processed across all industries.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>We wanted to share our policies on how and what we control and process.&nbsp; Spinview’s responsibility depends on whether it acts as a controller or a processor of personal data.</p>
     <p>Information about us</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>We are Spinview UK Limited, (company number 10174165), and our registered office is at 52 High Street, Pinner, Middlesex, HA5 5PW United Kingdom.</p>
     <p>Our Data Protection Officer can be contacted by email at dpo@spinview.io or by writing to: DPO, Spinview UK Limited 10 Bloomsbury Way, Holborn, London WC1A 2SL.</p>
     <p>This policy explains how we collect, store and use your personal information and why we do this so please read it carefully. As mentioned above we can act as a data controller or a data processor depending on the particular circumstances which is explained in more detail below.</p>
     <p>Data Protection Law</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>For the purposes of this policy data protection law means: (i) unless and until it is no longer directly applicable in the UK, the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679) (GDPR) and any national implementing laws, regulations and secondary legislation, as amended or updated from time to time, in the UK; and then (ii) any subsequent, and successor, legislation to the GDPR or the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
     <p>We will comply with data protection law. Personal information we hold will be:</p>
     <p>Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.</p>
     <p>Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way that is incompatible with those purposes.</p>
     <p>Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes.</p>
     <p>Accurate and kept up to date.</p>
     <p>Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.</p>
     <p>Kept securely.</p>
     <p>What is personal data?</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Personal data or personal information refers to any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not refer to anonymous data. Anonymous data is information where any personal identifiers have been removed. There are “special categories” of more sensitive personal data which require a higher level of protection.</p>
     <p>Controlling your data</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>When we act as a data controller, Spinview decides on the purpose for holding personal data and how to process it.</p>
     <p>What we may be collecting from you:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>All personal information disclosed by you to us either consensually during registration or contractually</p>
     <p>Information that will help us contact you in the future like: name, company name, address, phone and email, this is because we believe there is a legitimate interest for both parties</p>
     <p>Some personal data may also be collected about you from the forms and surveys you complete, from records of our correspondence and phone calls.</p>
     <p>Specifically, we log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our services, including our sites, VR experiences, app and platform technology. We may collect:</p>
     <p>All personal information disclosed by you to us either consensually during registration or contractually such as your name, billing and delivery address, telephone number, email address, items ordered and payment details. We also store passwords for any accounts that are created</p>
     <p>Authentication cookie allowing you to refresh your browser without logging out of our systems</p>
     <p>Information that is not personally identifiable for example what browser, operating system and device you have used to access our content, details about the country, city and language you have used to access our services, information about how and when you have interacted with our services</p>
     <p>We collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage with messages in connection with our services</p>
     <p>Some personal data may also be collected about you from the forms and surveys you complete</p>
     <p>Information we collect about you or receive from other sources.</p>
     <p>We may also collect, and third-party providers may also collect, information regarding your visit to our Site.&nbsp; This may include where you are geographically, your browser and device type, the pages you viewed and duration of your visit and any search terms used.&nbsp; This information may be collected even if you do not register an account with us.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>How is it data stored?</p>
     <p>We store data digitally using our own secure platform and analytics databases which are securely hosted within the EU. We also store data via globally recognised secure third-party software system, this is an integrated part of our business processes and systems.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>What we do with your data?</p>
     <p>We use the information to make telephone contact and to email you information which we believe may be of legitimate interest to you.</p>
     <p>We also use your data to produce and share aggregated insights that do not identify you. For example we may use your data to publish demographics for a specific webhosted visualisation or to present results of a survey.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Who can access your data?</p>
     <p>We do not transfer your personal data to anyone for marketing purposes without your consent. However, it may be necessary for us to share your personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Our service providers and suppliers:</p>
     <p>In order to make certain services available to you, we may need to share your personal information with some of our service providers.</p>
     <p>We only allow our service providers to handle your personal data when we have confirmed that they apply appropriate data protection and security controls.&nbsp; We also impose contractual obligations on service providers relating to data protection and security, which mean they can only use your data to provide services to us and to you, and for no other purposes.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Other third parties:</p>
     <p>in processing orders we may send your details to and use information from credit reference and fraud prevention agencies;</p>
     <p>if we or our business are acquired by a third party when our customers’ personal data will be transferred to the buyer;</p>
     <p>If we have to disclose in order to comply with a legal obligation;</p>
     <p>in order to enforce or apply the terms of our contract with you; or</p>
     <p>to protect the rights, property, or safety of Spinview, our customers, or others.</p>
     <p>We will not disclose any confidential information, except to employees and/or professional advisors (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and development) who need to know it and who have agreed in writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise bound) to keep such information confidential.</p>
     <p>We will ensure that those people and entities: (a) use such confidential information only to exercise rights and fulfil obligations, and (b) keep such confidential information confidential. Spinview may also disclose confidential information when required by law after giving reasonable notice to the discloser, such notice to be sufficient to give the discloser the opportunity to seek confidential treatment, a protective order or similar remedies or relief prior to disclosure.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>How long will we keep your information?</p>
     <p>We will retain your personal information no longer than is necessary for the purpose we obtained it for thereby reducing the risk that it will become inaccurate, out of date or irrelevant.&nbsp; Information that is no longer needed will be securely deleted. Different retention periods apply for different types of data, however the longest we will normally hold any personal data is 6 years.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>What are the consequences of failing to provide personal information or withdrawing consent?</p>
     <p>If you fail to provide certain information when requested:</p>
     <p>We may not be able to fulfill your orders or perform other aspects of any contract we have entered into with you.</p>
     <p>We may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations</p>
     <p>You may not be able to participate in the interactive aspects of our site.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Informing us of changes</p>
     <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your relationship with us.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Change of purpose</p>
     <p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.&nbsp; Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>International transfers</p>
     <p>To deliver products and services to you, it may sometimes be necessary for us to share your personal information outside of the European Economic Area, usually when service providers are located outside the EEA or if you are based outside the EEA.&nbsp; These transfers are subject to special rules under data protection laws. If this happens, we will ensure that the transfer will be compliant with data protection law and your personal information will be kept secure.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>What are your rights?</p>
     <p>You have the right to:</p>
