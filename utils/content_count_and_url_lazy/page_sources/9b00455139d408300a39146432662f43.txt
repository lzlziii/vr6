    <p><strong>How iLLOGIKA Retains Your Information</strong>:  ILLOGIKA retains, uses and stores your information as long as you are playing our games or using our Services, and also for the period necessary to fulfill all the purposes described in this Privacy Policy (e.g., resolve disputes, answer regulatory or police requests) in compliance with the applicable laws of your country of residence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How iLLOGIKA Shares Your Information…</strong></p>

    <p><u>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><strong>with ILLOGIKA Entities</strong>:  In order to operate the Services, we may transfer your personal information to other ILLOGIKA studios or entities, subsidiaries, processors or third parties located anywhere in the world (see section 6 below).</p>

    <p><u>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><strong>with Third-Parties</strong>:  We use third-party services that have limited access to your information for specific purposes, including, but not limited to, administration, analytics, optimization, advertising, prize delivery, marketing assistance, customer service, and data analysis; such third-parties assist us with our operations and are authorized to use your information for such specific purposes only.</p>

    <p>If you decide, while using our Services, to use social sharing features on third-party social networks (e.g., Facebook’s  “Share” or “Like”), such use may cause us, and signify your consent to allow us, to collect, to share and to transfer your personal and non-personal information both to and from such third-party social networks; you should visit such third-party sites to find and to learn more about their information collection policies and practices.</p>

    <p><u>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><strong>with Authorities</strong>:  We reserve the right (i) to report to law enforcement agency activities that we, in good faith, believe to be illegal, (ii) to investigate and/or to take action to counter illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the Services, and (iii) to protect the property or safety of others.  Furthermore, we may disclose your information per any law or court order worldwide, provided such information relates to any actual or threatened harmful conduct; before doing so, we will consider applicable local laws, the nature of the order, and the legitimacy and proportionality of your information.</p>

    <p><u>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><strong>With Buyers</strong>:  If and when we opt to sell our company or any line of business, including the assets relating thereto, we may, in connection with such sale, share customer information, including your information, with potential and actual buyer(s).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>International Operations and Transfers of Your Information</strong>:  ILLOGIKA is headquartered in Canada. As part of our international operations, we may transfer your information to our affiliates (e.g., subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures, and other corporate entities under common ownership of iLLOGIKA) from time to time for our legitimate business purposes; we have taken measures to treat such information securely and lawfully, and to ensure that we adequately protect such information in the jurisdictions in which we process it.</p>

    <p><strong>Security and Confidentiality of Your Information</strong>:  We have implemented security measures to safeguard your information, including credit card information; such safeguards will help maintain data security and prevent unauthorized access to such information.  Since, however, transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network is never fully secure, despite such security measures and the other reasonable precautions we take to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use of, or access to, your information that is under our control.</p>

    <p>If there is a breach of security involving your personal information, including credit card information, from our Services, then we will (i) notify you of such breach in a timely manner per local regulations, and (ii) take commercially reasonable steps to rectify such breach.</p>

    <p>If you believe that we, or any of our third-parties, are using your personal information improperly, then please notify us immediately via email at <a href="mailto:dataprotectionsupport@illogika.com">dataprotectionsupport@illogika.com</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Children</strong>:  We consider anyone younger than 13 to be a child, unless there are more stringent regulations (e.g., lower age threshold) in effect in such child’s state of residence.  We encourage parents and guardians to teach their children about privacy and to make them aware of the fact that some people may find and misuse their personal information on the Internet or any wireless network; we believe children should never disclose their name, address, phone number, and/or any personal information without their parents’ or guardian’s permission.  Parents and/or guardians must exercise their child’s privacy rights (see section 9 below).</p>

    <p>If we believe that a child is using our Services, then we can (i) block such child from using the Services, (ii) block such child from providing information, and/or (iii) prevent such child from:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>displaying his/her real name or any other personal information in any game;</li>
      <li>accessing any game’s chat, leaderboard, forums, SNS (Facebook, Game Center, etc.);</li>
      <li>subscribing to our newsletters;</li>
      <li>using any other feature where users could appear under their real names.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <p>In addition, we will (i) not collect, and we will prevent our third-party associates from collecting, any child’s precise geolocation data, and (ii) display to them contextual advertising only (excluding any behavioral advertising).</p>

    <p>We will allow a child to take part in testing our games (e.g., playtests), subject to his/her parents’ or guardians’ authorization and/or physical presence (when a state or other location requires such physical presence during the playtest).</p>
  </li>
  <li>

    <p>If you have previously subscribed to our newsletter or consented to any direct marketing (each, a “Communication” and collectively, the “Communications”) and no longer wish to receive a Communication, then you can unsubscribe from, and we’ll stop sending you, such Communication by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link available in any of the Communications.</p>

    <p>If you are the parent or guardian of a child who is under 13 years of age (or under some other age as specified in applicable regulations in your location) and believe your child has provided us with personal information, then please inform us at this <a href="mailto:dataprotectionsupport@illogika.com">email</a> and we will no longer collect and use, and will erase, such information.</p>

    <p>Since iLLOGIKA needs to collect and to process certain information, whether by itself or via third-party associates, in order to provide the Services, please note that your actions, including your opting out of providing some or all of your information, may (i) affect game functionality, Services and features, and/or (ii) force iLLOGIKA to cease providing the Services to you.  As such, if and when you take the following action(s), we will reset or not be able to deliver your game or the Services:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>request limitations, or altogether object, to our processing of mandatory information;</li>
      <li>withdraw your consent for us to collect and to use your information;</li>
      <li>ask us to erase your information.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you withdraw your consent for us to collect and to use your information, or ask us to erase your information, then we will not use or process your information any longer, but we will store such information, including an anonymous version of such information, to answer regulatory and/or police requests, and to maintain the integrity of our data.</p>

    <p>If you contact us with a certain request, and we need to validate your identity, both to protect your confidentiality to satisfy such request, then we will ask you to submit a copy of an official document to prove your identity.  Thereafter, we will (i) work to respond to your request in a timely manner (e.g., one month), and (ii) destroy the copy of the official document proving your identity soon after we satisfy your request and close the issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
