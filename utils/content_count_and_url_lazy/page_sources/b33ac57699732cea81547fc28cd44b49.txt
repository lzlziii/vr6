                <p class="lead">Bleeding Kansas is a VR game for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.</p>
		<p class="lead">Bleeding Kansas was the name given to a series of brutal and turbulent encounters that occurred from 1854 to 1861 in the United States. The conflict involved armed battles between anti-slavery “Free-Staters” and pro-slavery “Border Ruffian”. The border war, Bleeding Kansas, was a crucial point that lead the road to the American Civil war. However, all this hostility didn’t happen over night. Years and years of rivalry between people who were against slavery and people who were pro-slavery provoked this bloodshed.
There are several events that lead to the violent confrontations in Kansas and the border towns in Missouri. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 admitted Missouri and Maine as slave states. That was a way that they intended to keep balance between “free land” and “slave soil”. It also forbade the extension of slavery north of the 36°30′ latitude. Thirty years later, the situation in the United States had changed. Five bills were passed by the United States Congress in order to defuse an ongoing political battle between slave and free states regarding the status of territories obtained during the Mexican-American War. Those five bills were together called the Compromise of 1850.
By allowing the people of New Mexico and Utah to decide by popular vote whether their states supported slavery or were against it, the Compromise of 1850 violated the Missouri Compromise. The major event, that preceded the Bleeding Kansas border war, happened on May 30, 1854. That was the day U.S. Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska act which allowed people residing in Kansas and Nebraska to choose for themselves whether or not to allow slavery within the borders of their state. The act also repealed the Missouri Compromise. This enraged anti-slavery activists and abolitionists such as John Brown. A confrontation between the two rival sides was unavoidable and certainly bound to happen.

While he was there, James interviewed slaves and collected material which he later wrote about.

                                <em>Some have described John Brown as stubborn, smug, and sometimes deceitful... But no matter what anyone says, he will always be known as a man of action. Brown was born during the period of the Haitian Revolution. At that time, he saw Haitian slaves revolting against the French. The revolution that he spectated played an obvious role in his view towards slavery. His parents had strong belief in the Bible, and a strong hatred of slavery. He was a family oriented man, and had 20 children. He was selfless towards people in need, and gave shelter and land to fugitive slaves. John Brown helped establish the League of Gileadites, an organization that worked to protect escaped slaves from slave catchers.
Although, he was never financially successful, he had one thing going for him: Faith.
He was a radical abolitionist who believed that God had selected him to lead slaves into freedom. If that required the use of force, well, that was God’s will too. Brown thought that slaves would rise up against their oppressors if properly armed. He assumed the revolt, once it begun, would spread throughout the South. 
People such as Abraham Lincoln called Brown “insane”, but Brown’s actions were one of great idealism and placed him in the company of the great liberators of mankind.</em>

                                <em>Harriet was an extraordinary woman whose deeds shall always be remembered. She was born as Araminta Ross, but later took on the name “Harriet” after her mother. Her surname Tubman came from her first husband, who she married in 1844. Harriet was born a slave, but managed to free herself from slavery when she fled to Pennsylvania - a free state. She was an abolitionist, activist, humanitarian, and a constant source of inspiration. After she freed herself from slavery, she would return to Maryland many times where she risked her life and freedom so that she could rescue both family members and other slaves. She made it her mission. She led hundreds to freedom in the North, and was known as the most famous “conductor” on the Underground Railroad. Harriet was also known for her nickname “Moses”, after the prophet Moses in the Bible who led his people to freedom. It is said that she never lost a single passenger during her expeditions. She suffered from headaches, seizures, and vivid dreams her whole life as a result of head trauma that she had experienced as a teenager. Due to her head injury, Harriet had powerful visions. She thought that this was God’s way to help guide her on many of her trips where she led others to freedom.
In 1858, Tubman met abolitionist John Brown. She agreed with his course of direct action, and supported his goals, even though she never advocated violence against white people. They had a mutual understanding of God, they both saw themselves as people on God’s mission to free the oppressed slaves. Brown called Harriet “General Tubman”, and he asked her to gather former slaves who would be willing to join his rebellion.
Harriet was a woman of many trades. She was an active proponent of women’s suffrage, and she worked for the Union Army as a cook, nurse, and a spy.
Harriet Tubman was a true American icon.

                                <em>The man that lost the presidential race against Abraham Lincoln. Stephen Douglas was an American politician and was popular for the nickname “Little Giant”. He might have been a short man, but he was indeed powerful. He had a brilliant mind and Stephen had dedicated his life to his country and politics. Stephen Douglas himself never owned a slave, and he developed the theory of popular sovereignty which meant that people would decide for themselves whether or not they would permit slavery within the borders of their territory. His theory later became the Kansas-Nebraska act.

                                <em>Dred Scott was an African American man who believed justice could give him and his family their freedom. He was born a slave, and had attempted to flee for his freedom. Unfortunately, his attempts were unsuccessful. He had a wife and two beautiful daughters who were his never ending source of strength and inspiration to keep fighting until they finally get what they deserve – freedom. Dred Scott is most known due to the Dred Scott vs. Sandford case, where he unsuccessfully tried to sue the United States of America for the freedom of him and his family. The case brought a lot of attention to the slavery issue that America was facing. Ironically, after the case, when his owners decided to free him, he didn’t have the chance to embrace and enjoy freedom as fully as he wanted to. He died of tuberculosis in 1858, surrounded by the people that he loved the most.

Henry Ward Beecher was also known for his luck with the ladies which resulted in an adultery scandal. Besides that, he was a well-known anti slavery activist since he had hatred towards slavery that was brewing inside of him for years. He was a man of God, and he believed that everyone had the right of freedom. Henry even purchased the freedom of several slaves and made sure that they had shelter and food. If Henry believed in something, then he did his best to be as helpful as he could be. He even raised money so that he could send Sharps rifles to abolitionists.

She grew up in Connecticut where she wasn’t really aware of slavery, but after her move to Cincinnati she had the opportunity to see the horrors of slavery since slavery was legal in Ohio. The more she became familiar with slavery, the more it appalled her. Writing was her way of bringing the issues of slavery to light, especially to people who weren’t acquainted with the hardship that slaves went through. Harriet obviously had a firm belief that her world could change the world.
