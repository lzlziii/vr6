<p><u>Our Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies</u></p>
<p>‍We protect your Personal Information through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies.</p>
<p>‍</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Limited retention</em>: We retain each category of Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Information collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Service if your account has been banned or your access to the Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Information, the purposes for which we process the Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Information if we stop operating the Game or feature through which the Personal Information was acquired.</li>
</ul>
<p>‍</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Purpose limitation</em>: We will use your Personal Information only for the Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Information to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>‍</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Security measures</em>: We use appropriate measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Information processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Notice does not guarantee the security of your Personal Information. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach.</li>
</ul>
<p>‍</p>
<p><u>Your Practices and Activities</u></p>

<h3>Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>​</strong></p>
<p>JOLLYCO™ is based in the United States and Moldova.&nbsp; We process and store information in the U.S. and other countries.

<p>​</p>
<p>If you are in the European Economic Area, we intend to provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA through a series of intercompany agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses authorized under EU law.

<h3>European Economic Area</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>​</strong></p>
<p>If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the processing of your personal data.</p>
<p>​</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>
<h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>​</strong></p>
<p>If you are in the EEA, when we process your personal data we will only do so in the following situations:</p>
<p>​</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to use your personal data to perform our responsibilities&nbsp;under our contract with you. For example, we use personal data&nbsp;about you to accurately bill you, to process payments (through a&nbsp;third-party payment processor) for your use of our Services, and&nbsp;to provide the Service you have requested.</li>
<li>We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data.&nbsp;For example, we may process your personal data to communicate&nbsp;with you about changes to our Services, to provide, secure, and&nbsp;improve our Services, and to track usage of our Services to better&nbsp;understand how they are being used. Additionally, we may use&nbsp;personal data about you to send you promotional communications&nbsp;and news about gaming updates</li>
<li>We have your consent to do so. For example, if we intend to&nbsp;change the way we process personal data that you have already&nbsp;provided to us, in a material way, we will request your consent&nbsp;before doing so. If you process your personal data based on&nbsp;consent, you have right to withdraw your consent at any time by&nbsp;emailing us at the point of contact listed at the end of this policy.</li>
<li>We have a legal obligation to process your personal data. For&nbsp;example, we may need to retain certain personal data to comply&nbsp;with our recordkeeping and retention requirements or we may&nbsp;need to retain certain sales information to comply with applicable&nbsp;law.</li>
</ul>
<p>​</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>
<h3>Data Subject Requests</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>​</strong></p>
<p>If you are in the EEA, you have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@jollyco.us">info@jollyco.us</a> and <a href="mailto:dev@jollyco.us">dev@jollyco.us</a></p>
<p>​</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We store the information we collect on you for as long as is necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected it, or for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations.</p>
