    <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>2. What is Personal Data and what do we collect?</strong></h2>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What is personal data?</h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where this Policy refers to ‘personal data’ it is referring to data about
        you from which you could be identified – such as your name, your date of birth, your contact details and even
        your IP address. Our privacy is important to us, so we limit the amount of personal data we gather, process and
        store about you to an absolute minimum.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By law we are obliged to process your personal data in certain ways and to
        ensure that you are given an appropriate amount of information about how they use it. You also have various
        rights to seek information from those organisations about how they are using your data, and to prevent them from
        processing it unlawfully. For more information about these rights, please see the ‘Your Rights’ section of this
        Policy.</p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Data we collect from you when you use our Services</strong></h3>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Part 1 - Analytics Data</em></h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Analytics” means data which is provided to us by our game via your device
        when you use one of Festa Tech LLC’s Services, which we combine with similar data from other gamers in order to
        improve our products and services, or to help us to understand more about people who play our games. All
        Analytics data is anonymized from the start and thus not Personal data. Also, we do NOT connect or correlate
        this data with any Personal Data you may chose to give to us. Analytics data is collected, processed and stored
        through Google Analytics or Game Analytics.</p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>What data do we collect for analytics?</em></h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may collect some or all of the data described below. However, please
        note that the actual data which we collect may differ depending on the platform on which you use our product,
        and on the particular product you use:</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The frequency and timing of purchases of Festa Tech LLC products,
                or
                the dates on which Festa Tech LLC products are first used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Information about your hardware configuration or specification
                (which may include manufacturer, CPU speed, memory, graphics card / processor and operating system).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Information about in-game events and how you used or purchased our
                products or services. For example, the data collected could include the following: (a) that completed a
                certain game stage after a certain amount of time; (b) which content you downloaded or removed; (c) if
                you used a certain tool during the game; or (d) that you acquired a particular DLC pack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may be able to adjust the privacy settings on your device to
                change the Analytics data which we can obtain. In particular you will always be able to opt out of
                providing Analytics data to us through our Games in the game settings.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>How we use this data.</em></h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We use Analytics data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To monitor how any products or services or features are operating.
                We do this in “real time” (sometimes known as “telemetry”) and we also look back over Analytics data for
                past events (sometimes known as “analytics”).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To improve our products and services, including by identifying
                problems or bugs and balancing servers, and better understanding the hardware configurations and
                specifications used by our customers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To understand the countries or geographic regions in which the
                users of our products and services are located.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Part 2 - Other Voluntary Provision of Data</em></h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is currently the only place where we collect personal data.&nbsp;</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where you voluntarily supply your personal data to us outside of the
        channels described above, for example where you; use one of our Websites or Services to upload or send personal
        data (by filling out a form to describe a fault or bug, subscribe to a publication or newsletter, take part in a
        survey, post a comment, or engage in similar activities in which you volunteer data about yourself) we may
        collect, store and use the personal data that you disclose to us.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The personal data we collect from you may include your title, name,
        address, e-mail address, Discord ID, Oculus ID, and phone number, but will depend on precisely what details you
        volunteer to us as you interact with the Website.</p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Part 3 - Automated Collection of Data</em></h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may use third party service providers to assist us with Analytics data
        for mobile apps and Websites only. These may include Google Analytics, Game Analytics, Facebook and Adroll. This
        does not affect the nature of data collected, or how it is used, as described above.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The following are examples of data we may collect:</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
        <li>

        use it to ensure that the Website works properly and that you are able to receive the full benefit of it.
        Second, we use the data to monitor online traffic and audience participation across the Website. We undertake
        both of these activities because we have a legitimate interest in doing so.</p>
    <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>3. How and why do we use/share your personal data</strong></h2>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sharing your personal data</h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In addition to the uses of your Personal Data described above we may share
        it, only when absolutely needed, in the following ways:</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">with the providers of platforms that we use to distribute our
                Services to you (such as web stores and the service networks of console providers); and</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">with analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the
                improvement and optimisation of this Website as described above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We will not share your personal data with third parties in order
                for that third party to provide direct marketing communications to you.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We may also disclose your personal data to third parties in the following
        events:</p>
    <ul data-rte-list="default">
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in
                order to comply with any legal obligation, or if we are asked to provide your details to a lawful
                authority in order to aid in the investigation of crime or disorder; and/or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">in order to enforce or apply our Services or Websites’ terms of
                use or terms and conditions; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our
                customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for
                the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our service providers provide us with a variety of administrative,
                statistical, and technical services. We will only provide service providers with the minimum amount of
                personal data they need to fulfil the services we request, and we stipulate that they protect this data
                and do not use it for any other purpose. We take these relationships seriously and oblige all of our
                data processors to sign contracts with us that clearly set out their commitment to respecting individual
                rights, and their commitments to assisting us to help you exercise your rights as a data subject.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>4. FOR HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</strong></h2>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We will hold your personal data on our systems only for as long as
        required to provide you with the services you have requested or to perform the purpose for which that data was
        collected.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see ‘Your
        Rights’ below for further information.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can
        no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this data
        indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
    <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>5. SECURITY</strong></h2>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Festa Tech LLC may store your personal data on secure servers either on
        our
        premises or in secure third party data centres.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If we ever give you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables
        you to access certain parts of this Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask
        you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
    <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>6. YOUR RIGHTS</strong></h2>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a data subject you have a number of rights in relation to your personal
        data. Below, we have described the various rights that you have, as well as how you can exercise them.</p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Right of Access</h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may, at any time, request access to the personal data that we hold
        which relates to you (you may have heard of this right being described as a “subject access request“).</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Please note that this right entitles you to receive a copy of the personal
        data that we hold about you in order to enable you to check that it is correct and to ensure that we are
        processing that personal data lawfully. It is not a right that allows you to request personal data about other
        people, or a right to request specific documents from us that do not relate to your personal data.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact
        details set out here and telling us that you are making a subject access request. You do not have to fill in a
        specific form to make this kind of request.</p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Right to Rectification and Erasure</h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may, at any time, request that we correct personal data that we hold
        about you which you believe is incorrect or inaccurate. You may also ask us to erase personal data if you do not
        believe that we need to continue retaining it (you may have heard of this right described as the “right to be
        forgotten”).</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Please note that we may ask you to verify any new data that you provide to
        us and may take our own steps to check that the new data you have supplied us with is right. Further, we are not
        always obliged to erase personal data when asked to do so; if for any reason we believe that we have a good
        legal reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to erase we will tell you what that reason is
        at the time we respond to your request.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact
        details set out here and telling us that you are making a request to have your personal data rectified or erased
        and on what basis you are making that request. If you want us to replace inaccurate data with new data, you
        should tell us what that new data is. You do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.
    </p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where we process your personal data on the basis of a legitimate interest
        (see the sections of this Policy which explain how and why we use your information) you are entitled to ask us
        to stop processing it in that way if you feel that our continuing to do so impacts on your fundamental rights
        and freedoms or if you feel that those legitimate interests are not valid.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You may also ask us to stop processing your personal data (a) if you
        dispute the accuracy of that personal data and want us verify that data’s accuracy; (b) where it has been
        established that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where we no longer need
        to process your personal data (and would otherwise dispose of it) but you wish for us to continue storing it in
        order to enable you to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Please note that if for any reason we believe that we have a good legal
        reason to continue processing personal data that you ask us to stop processing, we will tell you what that
        reason is, either at the time we first respond to your request or after we have had the opportunity to consider
        and investigate it.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can exercise this right at any time by writing to us using the contact
        details set out here and telling us that you are making a request to have us stop processing the relevant aspect
        of your personal data and describing which of the above conditions you believe is relevant to that request. You
        do not have to fill in a specific form to make this kind of request.</p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Right to stop receiving communications</h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where we send you e-mail marketing communications (or other regulated
        electronic messages) you have the right to opt-out at any time by writing to us at privacy@festatech.com and
        telling us which communications you would like us to stop sending you.</p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your Right to object to automated decision making and profiling</h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You have the right to be informed about the existence of any automated
        decision making and profiling of your personal data, and where appropriate, be provided with meaningful
        information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such
        processing that affects you.</p>
    <h3 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Exercising your rights</h3>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you write to us making a request to exercise your rights we are
        entitled to ask you to prove that you are who you say you are. We may ask you to provide copies of relevant ID
        documents to help us to verify your identity.</p>
    <p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It will help us to process your request if you clearly state which right
        you wish to exercise and, where relevant, why it is that you are exercising it. The clearer and more specific
        you can be, the faster and more efficiently we can deal with your request. If you do not provide us with
        sufficient information then we may delay actioning your request until you have provided us with additional
        information (and where this is the case we will tell you).</p>
