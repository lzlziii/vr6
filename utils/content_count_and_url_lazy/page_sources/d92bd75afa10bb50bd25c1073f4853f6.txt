						<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

						<h4>Introduction</h4>

						<p>This Privacy Policy sets out the manner in which <b>HYPER GAMEY</b> (“Company”, “We”, “Us”,
							“Our”) collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a
							“User”) of the <b>COPTER STRIKE VR</b> game (“Game”).</p>

						<h4>Data Collection</h4>

						<p>We collect the User’s username and User ID, both of which are obtained from the User’s Oculus
							account. The User’s username is used to display the User’s name during the Game and for
							multiplayer purposes, ensuring that each username is unique within a given room.</p>

						<h4>Data Storage</h4>

						<p>We do not store any data collected from the User. The User’s username and User ID are used
							only for the duration of the User’s session in the Game and are not retained after the
							session ends.</p>

						<h4>Data Access</h4>

						<p>No data is stored, so there is no need for authorized personnel of the Company to have access
							to the data.</p>

						<h4>Data Retention</h4>

						<p>No data is retained after the User’s session in the Game ends.</p>

						<h4>Data Deletion</h4>

						<p>No data is stored, so there is no need for the User to request deletion.</p>

						<h4>Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>

						<p>The Company may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any material changes are
							made to the Privacy Policy, the Company will notify Users by posting a notice on the
							Company’s website or within the Game.</p>
