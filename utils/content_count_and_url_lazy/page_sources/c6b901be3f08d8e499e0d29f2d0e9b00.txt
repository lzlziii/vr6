		<h2 id="about">How did John's Project start?</h2>
		<p>
			You don't know? Well, let me tell you a story.
			<br><br>
			In the beginning, there was gaming. 
			<br><br>
			One day, my father had the idea to teach me software development. But, at that time, we tried and failed. 
			Yet, that failure sparked an incredible idea, something that had never crossed my mind even in my wildest 
			dreams. Instead of just playing games, I could create them myself. Create worlds where every detail is 
			just as I imagine and dream, and other people can enter these worlds, maybe even meet other people there, 
			and have fun!
			<br><br>
			After realizing this, I've embarked on a solo research journey, perhaps the most important in my life. 
			The results of this journey forever altered my path.
			<br><br>
			This is how everything began. Gaming turned into game development, and software development came along. 
			Today I've finished school, and I'm trying to make a living from my hobby. This is my current project, 
			all my games and software are a part of it, my biggest project, John's Project.
