The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Consumer Rules”), with the following modifications:</p>
<p>1. Arbitration fees and costs shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, or if you send Devster LLC a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the administrative fees required to initiate an arbitration, Devster LLC may elect to pay all AAA administrative fees.</p>
<p>2. If the Dispute does not exceed $25,000, the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of written submissions.</p>
<p>3. The parties may bring any dispositive motion or motions during the course of the proceedings.</p>
<p>4. The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, which will include the findings and conclusions on which the decision is based. The arbitrator has the authority to issue any relief allowed by applicable law, but may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.</p>
<p>The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. You and Devster LLC may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p><strong>D. Limitations</strong></p>
<p>YOU AND DEVSTER LLC AGREE THAT DEVSTER LLC MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AS TO ALL DISPUTES. The arbitrator shall not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. If this paragraph D is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.</p>
<p><strong>E. Location</strong></p>
<p>Arbitration shall be initiated in the County of Collin, State of Texas, United States of America, and you and Devster LLC agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court, in order to compel arbitration, to stay the proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p><strong>F. Recovery</strong></p>
<p>If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against Devster LLC and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than Devster LLC’s last written settlement offer made before Devster LLC makes its final written submissions to the arbitrator, then Devster LLC will:</p>
<p>1. Pay you 150% of your arbitration award, up to $5,000 USD over and above your arbitration award; and</p>
<p>2. Reimburse the arbitration fees that you paid to the AAA.</p>
<p><strong>G. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</strong></p>
<p>DEVSTER LLC will not enforce material changes to this agreement to arbitrate, unless you expressly agree to the changes.</p>
<p><strong>H. Severability</strong></p>
<p>If any clause within this Section 15 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause set forth in paragraph D above) is found to be unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 15 and the remainder of this Section 15 will remain in full force and effect.</p>
