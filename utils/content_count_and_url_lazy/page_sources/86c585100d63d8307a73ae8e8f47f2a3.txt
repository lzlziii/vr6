<h2 id="content7">7. 5G COVET</h2>
<p>The 5G COVET app (“the App”) is an interactive educational application owned by New York University and Columbia
University and hosted on <a href="https://abelanavr.com">AbelanaVR.com</a>. The App aims to bridge the digital
and equity divide by featuring the
next generation of K-12 educational activities. The App leverages virtual reality (VR) and 5G technologies
aiming to increase student engagement and participation. Through the App, the students can learn fundamental
concepts in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The App is child-directed since students
are in control of the VR experience. The students can use the App in a closed classroom, educational lab setting
with access facilitated by the lab manager or teacher. The App environment includes real-world inspired,
simulated scenarios optionally used in conjunction with the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) teaching method.
</p>
<p>
What Information Do We Collect from Organizations?
</p>
<p>
We do not collect any information from organizations. Organizations may download and install the app on
workstations with VR headsets. To play the 5G COVET app, one must supply a classroom code obtained through the
Verizon VILS platform. Multiple students can be present in the same VR venue by using the classroom code on each
workstation.
</p>
<p>
What Personal Information Do We Collect from Children?
</p>
<p>
We do not collect any student personal information, identifiers, geolocation, or other data, either actively or
automatically. We delete any numerical data (not personal information) entered to calculate answers to knowledge
questions or vote on which response is correct at the end of the session. Furthermore, we do not save any
personal settings (e.g., choosing a learning experience based on grade level). There is no advertising in the
App, no links to external services, and no user-generated content creation or retention.

<h2 id="content8">8. LOOKING INSIDE CELLS</h2>
<p>
<b>Privacy Policy: Looking Inside</b>
</p>
<p>
The NYU CREATE Lab creates games that help improve people’s lives. To do that, we need to understand how
well our games do what they are designed to do: being fun and helping people. At the same time, it is
important for us to ensure that kids and families can enjoy our games without concerns about their
privacy and safety.
</p>
<p>
As a university research lab, we uphold strong privacy practices that often go beyond FERPA and COPPA
requirements. By simply playing our games you are not actively participating in our research and the data we
collect is limited. This brief document explains what kind of data is collected by “Looking Inside”. We also
explain what happens to the data, and what it is used for.
</p>
<p>
<b>WE DON’T COLLECT SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA</b>
</p>
<p>
This is an important issue for us. Our games never share any personal information with any party. In fact, the
game doesn’t even have access to any kind of personal data, or data that could be used to directly
identify players or device owners.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the game does not have access to: player name or nickname, player gender, device location,
device owner account, phone contacts, phone SMS or other apps contents.
</p>
<p>
<b>WE COLLECT GAMEPLAY DATA TO IMPROVE THE GAME</b>
</p>
<p>
The game collects limited data about player activities within the game. As an example, the data we collect
includes, but is not limited to, the following game-related indicators: screens the player visits, levels
the player has completed, and actions the player makes.
</p>
<p>
The collected data is processed only internally by ourselves (NYU CREATE Lab), in order to understand the
players’ experience in the game, and ultimately improve it.
</p>
<p>
All collected data is strictly anonymized: we never get to match playing behavior to player identities, and
that is because, as stated before, the game doesn’t collect any kind of personal data.
</p>
<p>
The collected data also includes the following technical information about the device used by the player:
brand, model, operating system and version, and the country where the player is located.
</p>
<p>
<b>WE USE TECHNOLOGY WHICH COLLECTS TECHNICAL DATA</b>
</p>
<p>
The game is built using Unreal Engine 4, a game engine that requires access to some technical information
about the player’s device in order to work properly: device manufacturer, hardware components, device and
network identifiers, user language, etc. The collected technical data is sent to Unreal and aggregated in
publicly-available statistics. The game has no control over how Unreal uses such information.
</p>
<p>
Please read <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/ja/eula/publishing">Unreal’s privacy policy</a> for details
about the data collected by Unreal.
</p>
<p>
<b>YOUR DATA, YOUR RIGHTS</b>
</p>
<p>
If you have any questions regarding your rights about data,
please e-mail <a href="mailto:create.lab@outlook.com">create.lab@outlook.com</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="content9">9. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
<p>
<i>
<b>In Short:</b> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Sites or Apps from outside United States,
please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and
by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED
WITH ANYONE?" above), in the United States, and other countries.
</p>
<p>
If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not have data protection or other
laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your
personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable law.
</p>
<p>
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework:
</p>
<p>
In particular, the Company complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.
Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the
European Union to the United States and has certified its compliance with it. As such, Company is committed to
subjecting all personal information received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the
Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield
Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.
</p>
<p>
Company is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives, under the Privacy Shield
Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.
</p>
<p>
With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Company
is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. FTC. In certain situations, we may be required to
disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national
security or law enforcement requirements.
</p>
<h2 id="content10">10. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>
<i>
<b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.
</i>
</p>
<p>
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or
other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for
longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
</p>
<p>
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
processing until deletion is possible.
</p>
<h2 id="content11">11. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
<p>
<i>
<b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and
technical security measures.
</i>
</p>
<p>
We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet
itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
