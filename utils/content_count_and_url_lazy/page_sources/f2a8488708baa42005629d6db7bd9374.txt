    <h1>Avontus Software Corporation Privacy Policy</h1>
</hgroup>
        Last updated May 10, 2013
        <p>Your privacy is a priority to us, and the aim of our Privacy Policy is to help you make informed decisions about how you interact with our products, services, and marketing communications. </p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that you may decide to provide to Avontus Software Corporation (“we” or “us”) in your use of our website or through our software applications (individually or collectively, our website and our software applications are referred to herein as the “Services”).  Please take a moment to read this document to learn about our information collection practices that may affect you as either a registered or non-registered user (each a “User”) of our Services.</p>
        <p>Your use of the Services and any personal information you provide through the Services remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time and without prior notice. When we change the Privacy Policy we will update the “Last Updated Date” above and post the modification on our website and possibly elsewhere within the Services. When we change the policy in a material way, we will provide Users with a notice of the modification by email. </p>
        
        <h3>Why We Collect Personal Information</h3>
We may collect information about you through your use of the Services to provide you with a superior and personally relevant user experience. The information we collect can be personal or non-personal in nature, and may be used alone or in the aggregate with that of other Users. Your Personal Information (defined below), for instance, may be used in some cases to recommend products of interest directly to you, and in other cases for market research purposes that support our efforts to deliver a more valuable service to our community of users. For example, we may use your Personal Information to contact you with announcements, newsletters and promotional materials related to our Services. In addition, we use Customer Information (defined below) as part of your use of our Services.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. (See “Changing or Removing Information” below for further information.) 

<h3>What Information We Collect </h3>
In the course of using the Services, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you; personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address and mailing address (individually or collectively, “Personal Information”). We collect your Personal Information in connection with your registration to use our Services. 
We also collect other information that you may provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your user experience (e.g., without limitation, zip code and user preferences) (“Non-Identifying Information”). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (e.g., combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (e.g., your viewing preferences). 
If you are an authorized customer of our software products, you may electronically submit data or information to our servers as part of your use of the Services (“Customer Data”).  We will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such Customer Data except as specifically provided herein, or as may be required by law. We may access Customer Data only for the purposes of providing our Services to you, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, at your request in connection with customer support matters or your use of the Services, or as may be required by law.
When you launch any of our Services from a mobile device, we may collect your device type, the unique device ID issued for your mobile device (“Device ID”) and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, if applicable. We use the Device ID to make it possible to authenticate and understand use of our Services. As part of your use of the Services, we collect and store the files you upload, download or access through the Services.
<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
As is standard practice on many websites, our website use “cookies” to help us study traffic patterns on our website and understand the effectiveness of our marketing communications. A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser. Other types of cookies exist, but the cookies we use in connection with our Services can only identify your browser and cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Cookies can reveal, for instance, which pages on our website are the most popular, how much time visitors are spending there, and how they are interacting with the content on these pages. You have the option to disable cookies by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to view or use all portions of website due to limited functionality. 
<h3>When We Disclose Your Information</h3>
<p><em>Within the Services</em>
<br>As a User you may create your own profile and transmit information through the Services.  Please remember that any communications you have via the Services, depending on, for example, the functionality of the Services, may reveal your screen name, and the content of your communications making this information available to others. We are not responsible for the activities of other Users or other third parties with whom you choose to provide your Personal Information or otherwise. 
</p>
<p><em>With Third Parties</em>
<br>We may share aggregated information that includes Non-Identifying Information with third party providers with whom we have a strategic relationship. The information shared with these third parties may be used to support user trend analyses and demographic profiling but will not contain your Personal Information. Some Third Party Publishers also act as service providers and vendors to us, so in those cases we will share your information as described below. 
</p>
<p><em>With our Service Providers and Vendors </em>
<br>Disclosure of your Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information may also occur where we employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services (e.g., without limitation, improvement of our Services’ features, user account authentication), to provide the Services on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are being used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. 
</p>
<p><em>Under Special Circumstances </em>
<br>At times, we may disclose information about you to law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of us or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity. 
</p>
<h3>Our Policy Toward Children</h3>
IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.
<p>We do not permit users under the age of 13 to create accounts with us.</p>
<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who uses the Services, then please contact us at support@avontus.com to have that child's information deleted.</p>
<h3>How We Protect Your Personal Information</h3>
We take your privacy very seriously and employ administrative, physical and electronic measures to safeguard your information from identity theft and unauthorized access. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited communication (e.g. via e-mail, telephone, mobile device). You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
<p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting through the Services in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>
<h3>Changing or Removing Information</h3> 
As a User, your may update or delete the Personal Information in your profile by emailing us at support@avontus.com to request that we delete/update your Personal Information from our database. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request. We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.
<p>Where you share information with other users through the communication channels of our Services, you generally cannot remove such communications. </p>
<h3>Links to Other Websites</h3> 
Our Services may contain links to other websites and online services. If you choose to click on an advertisement or another third party link, you may be directed to that third party’s website or service. The fact that we link to a third party website or service is not an endorsement or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services. These other websites or services may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or mobile devices, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites and services you use.
<h3>International Users</h3> 
If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we transfer Personal Information to and process it in the United States. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of Personal Information represents your agreement to that transfer. 
<h3>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy</h3>
In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
<h3>Contacting Us </h3>
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or information practices, please contact us at privacysupport@avontus.com.
