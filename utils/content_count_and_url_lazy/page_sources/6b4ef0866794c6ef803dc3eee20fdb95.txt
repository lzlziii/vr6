By using the Service and Applications, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.<br><br>This Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the MyDream Interactive Terms of Use. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the MyDream Interactive Terms of Use.</div><div class="paragraoh"><strong class="list-item">The information we collect on the Service and Applications:</strong></div><ul role="list" class="paragraoh"><li class="list-item paragraoh">User-provided Information. When you use the Service and Applications, you may provide and we may collect what is generally called “personally identifiable” information, or “personal information,” which is information that specifically identifies an individual. Examples of personal information include name, email address, mailing address, mobile phone number, and credit card or other billing information. Personal information also includes other information, such as date of birth, geographic area, or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual. You may provide us with personal information in various ways on the Service and Applications. For example, you provide us with personal information when you register for an account, use the Service and Applications, post User Content, make a purchase on the Service and Applications, interact with other users of the Service and Applications through communication or messaging features, or send us customer service-related requests.</li><li class="list-item paragraoh">“Cookies" Information. When you use the Service and Applications, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service and Applications. Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service and Applications, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service and Applications to their fullest potential.</li><li class="list-item paragraoh">“Automatically Collected" Information. When you use the Service and Applications, we may automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” We may also collect data from you using the Steam Web API. This “automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service and Applications, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service and Applications, the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service and Applications, and other information regarding your performance in and use of the Service and Applications. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users.</li><li class="list-item">Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons. We may also implement third-party content or advertising on the Service and Applications that may use clear gifs or other forms of web beacons, which allow the third-party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service and Applications. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may allow third parties to collect information about you through such third parties’ browser cookies, even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, and MyDream does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</li><li class="list-item paragraoh"><strong>Integrated Services.</strong> You may be given the option to access or register for the Service and Applications through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an “Integrated Service”), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide personal information or other information to us.
