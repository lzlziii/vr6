Terms of Service</p>
<p>Last updated October 1st, 2021</p>
<h2>1. LICENSE</h2>
<p>Welcome to use the services of Mekiwi Oy and VrKiwi.<br>
These terms (“Terms of Service” or “Terms”) govern the relationship between you, Mekiwi Oy (known also as Mekiwi Ltd.), a Finnish game company, and Mekiwi Ltd’s publishing label VrKiwi (hereinafter “VrKiwi” or “us” or “we”) regarding your use of VrKiwi’s games (the “Games”), and related services, which include VrKiwi branded websites (the “Websites”) and other games and online and mobile services and applications provided by VrKiwi (the Game, the Websites and other games and online and mobile services and applications developed and/or published by VrKiwi collectively, the “Service”). “VrKiwi” includes our affiliates (“Affiliates”), which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures, publishing labels and other corporate entities under common ownership.</p>
<h3>1.2. Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Use of the Service is also governed by VrKiwi’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference at the end of this document. Your privacy is important to us. We designed VrKiwi’s Privacy Policy to make important disclosures about how we collect and use your content and information and how you can use the Service to share such information with others. We encourage you to read the VrKiwi Privacy Policy carefully and use it to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and consent to the collection, use and storage of your information as outlined in VrKiwi’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>1.3. Updates to the Terms of Service and VrKiwi Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>VrKiwi reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service and its Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended Terms on or within the Service. You may also be given additional notice, such as an e-mail message or messaging within the Service, of any changes. You will be deemed to have accepted such changes by continuing to use the Service. Except as otherwise stated, all amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted. VrKiwi may also revise other policies, codes or rules at any time, and the new versions will be available at vr.mekiwi.org or in the Service. No amendment to the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy shall apply to any dispute of which VrKiwi had actual notice before the date of the amendment.</p>
<p>If at any point you do not agree to any portion of the then-current version of our Terms of Service, the VrKiwi Privacy Policy, or any other VrKiwi’s policy, rules or codes of conduct relating to your use of the Service, your license to use the Service shall immediately terminate and you must immediately stop using the Service.</p>
<p>To the extent the Terms of Service or VrKiwi Privacy Policy conflict with any other VrKiwi terms, policy, rules or codes of conduct, the terms contained in these Terms of Service and in the VrKiwi Privacy Policy shall govern.</p>
<h3>1.4. Grant of a Limited License to Use the Service</h3>
<p>Subject to your agreement and continuing compliance with these Terms of Service and any other relevant VrKiwi policies, VrKiwi grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable and limited license subject to the limitations in Sections 1.5-1.7 to access and use the Service using a VrKiwi supported equipment (such as HTC Vive or Oculus Rift), computer system, console or mobile device solely for your own non-commercial entertainment purposes. You agree not to use the Service for any other purpose.</p>
<p>You understand that while at times you may “earn” and with “real world” money to “buy” or “purchase” (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual coins, cash, tokens, or points, all for use in the Service; or (b) virtual in-game items (together with virtual currency, “Virtual Items”); these real world terms are only being used as shorthand. You do not in fact “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, you may purchase a limited license to use the Service, including software programs that occasionally manifest themselves as these items.<br>
Virtual Items are licensed to you on a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable basis and are intended solely for non-commercial use.</p>
<p>The purchase and sale of the limited license referred to in these Terms of Service is a completed transaction upon receipt of your direct payment or redemption of the Game. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your licensed copy of the Game does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license.</p>
<h3>1.5. Accessing the Service</h3>

<h3>9.5. No Waiver</h3>

<h3>9.7. Remedies</h3>
