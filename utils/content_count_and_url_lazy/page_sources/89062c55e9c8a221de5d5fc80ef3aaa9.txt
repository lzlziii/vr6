          <p>In some cases the personal data we collect from you might be processed outside the United Kingdom (“UK”) or European Economic Area (“EEA”). The countries in which your personal data is processed in may not have the same protections for your personal data that the UK or EEA do. However we are obliged to ensure that the personal data that is processed by us and our suppliers outside of the UK or EEA is protected in the same ways as it would be if it was processed within the UK or EEA. There are therefore certain safeguards in place when your data is processed outside of the UK or EEA.</p>
          <p>For example, whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we will ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.</li>
            <li>We may also use specific approved contracts with our service providers that are based in countries outside the EEA. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the EEA .</li>
            <li>Where we use service providers in the United States, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield scheme, which requires them to provide a similar level of protection of your personal data to what is required in the EEA.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>To find out more about how we safeguard your information as related to transfers contact us on <a href="mailto:EUPrivacy@vice.com">EUPrivacy@vice.com</a></p>

          <p>Note that the UK is still considered to be inside the EEA during its Brexit transition period, due to end 31 December 2020.</p>

The right of access </strong> <strong> – </strong>You have the right to obtain access to your information (if we’re processing it), and certain other information (similar to that provided in this privacy policy).

          <p><strong>3. The right to rectification </strong> <strong> – </strong>You’re entitled to have your information corrected if it’s inaccurate or incomplete. For more information or to request correction, please click <a href="//rebrand.ly/e41b0">here</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>4. The right to erasure </strong> <strong> – </strong>This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep using it. This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions. For more information or to request erasure, please click <a href="//rebrand.ly/e41b0">here</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>5. The right to restrict processing</strong> <strong> – </strong>You have rights to ‘block’ or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in future. For more information or to request restriction, please click <a href="//rebrand.ly/e41b0">here</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>6. The right to data portability</strong> <strong> – </strong>You have rights to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services.

          <p><strong>7. The right to object –</strong> You have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (which we do only with your consent). For more information or to object, please click <a href="//rebrand.ly/e41b0">here</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>8. The right to lodge a complaint – </strong>You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.</p>
          <p><strong>9. The right to withdraw consent – </strong>If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your personal data with your consent up to that point is unlawful). This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using your personal data for marketing purposes.</p>
          <p>We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or</li>
            <li> further copies of the same information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Alternatively, we may be entitled to refuse to act on the request.</p>
          <p>Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We’ll respond as soon as we can. Generally, this will be within one month from when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we’ll come back to you and let you know.</p>
