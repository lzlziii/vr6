We protect personal information using physical, technological and organizational safeguards. We regularly review our practices to ensure they align with reasonable industry practices appropriate to the level of sensitivity to safeguard personal information against loss or theft, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure.</p><p>However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure; as such, despite our safeguards and protocols, we cannot fully guarantee the security of your personal information and you should always exercise caution when disclosing personal information over the Internet.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Requests for access to and correction of personal information</h3><p>‍</p><p>Applicable privacy laws allow, to varying degrees, individuals the right to access or request the correction of errors or omissions in their personal information that is in our custody or under our control.

In our electronic communications with outside parties, we comply with the rules established by CASL and enforced by various Canadian authorities including the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. CASL regulates, and our policies generally apply to, each commercial electronic message (a “<strong>CEM</strong>”) that we send. A CEM is an electronic message sent to an electronic address that, among its purposes, encourages participation in a commercial activity.</p><p>In addition to adopting and updating this Policy, we undertake various transparency initiatives to ensure we comply with CASL, which include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Consent — we do not send you CEMs without your consent. This consent typically must be “express” (expressly acknowledged by you), but in certain circumstances can be “implied”. In other limited circumstances, consent is not required.&nbsp; We modified or adopted our sign-up, registration and consent forms in order to ensure that your consent is meaningful (i.e. informed and freely given) as required by CASL.&nbsp; When we collect your electronic contact information, you will know the exact purposes behind the collection.</li><li>Content — we adopted processes to ensure that our CEMs contain the following requirements prescribed under CASL, which will usually be in the footer of the CEM. We will:</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Identify ourselves as the party sending the CEM, and whether we are sending the message on our own behalf or on behalf of someone else;</li><li>Provide you with our contact information; and</li><li>Set out a clear, working unsubscribe mechanism or preference centre that is easy to use, automatic, and at no cost to you (other than your own cost of connecting to the Internet).</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Clarity — we ensured that each aspect of a CEM, including its header, content, or any links or URLs in the CEM) conveys the appropriate information, whether viewed individually or taken as a whole, so that you always know what you are clicking on.</li></ul><p>If you receive a CEM from us but believe that you should not have or no longer wish to receive CEMs, we will aim to respect your preferences in a timely manner once you update them through our unsubscribe mechanism. CASL requires us to process unsubscribe requests within 10 business days.&nbsp; If you have any questions or concerns about our unsubscribe options, you may contact us at the address indicated in Section 10 below.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Retention of your personal information</h3><p>‍</p><p>We generally keep personal information for only as long as it is needed to accomplish the purposes for which it was collected, or as otherwise needed to comply with applicable laws, protect our interests, or for authorized or legitimate purposes.&nbsp; When personal information is no longer necessary or relevant for the identified purposes, or is no longer required to be retained by applicable laws, we will take steps to have it deleted, destroyed, erased, aggregated or made anonymous. We use reasonable industry practices to ensure we have adequate controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to personal information.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h3>Updates or changes to this policy</h3><p>‍</p><p>This Policy was last updated on March 28, 2023. We will occasionally update this Policy and revise the "last updated" date appearing in this paragraph.&nbsp;</p><p>If we make any material changes you will receive a notice when you open our Service. Any change to this Policy will apply to existing information, as well as information collected onwards from the date that this Policy is posted or on the date as specified in the notification.

We will promptly investigate all complaints received, and if a complaint is justified, we will take the necessary steps to resolve the issue in question.<br></p><h3>request removal of all personal data</h3><p>To remove all traces of personal data from our games, services and servers.
