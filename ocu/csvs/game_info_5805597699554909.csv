Great physics, stylized well, and a good amount of content! However there are a fair amount of bugs. Main annoying thing is when you‚Äôre playing the COOP zombie mode it always crashes after round 6. Something that could be added is a lever for the collective. That way you can set it and leave it, also would feel much more realistic.","Took a chance on this game as i like flying Helicopters, come to think of it i am a cockpit VR kind of guy & üíô stick controls is my forte [check out my YT ü´° BlueBottles0] anyways... short and sweet of this quick review is Copter Strike looks sweet, fly's sweet & plays Sweet! Game modes for Days!. Priced right with a great deal of content for you to be happy with üí•üíØüí• trying to balance the review with both good & bad things, i cant! lol possibly needs bigger power units or upgrades, but as is right now. i am a Very happy i took a chance! üòÅüíô","Thank you developer for your fast response üôè all working now. Five stars from me ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Update: OMG! I found the Zombie mode in Co-op, so mutch fun lol!üòÇ Great achievement managing to get Copter Strike running on the Quest 2 . It will be interesting to see if update 51 will up the performance? Many thanks to the developer for making this game The controls feel great ( once mastered ) and there is a good sense of sim quality to flyings! ( Similar graphics & feel to Ultrawings) I couldn't find anyone playing online ( early days though ) maybe bots are needed Mr developer please ? I love low level flying at speed and once you make the cockpit fully transparent it's easy to land the helicopter in the courtyard of the square building! Looks like a lot of fun to be had in the future.",Super nice game only multiplayer is hard cuz there arent alot of people to play with bit still best game on my headset,"Heya, i need say that the game is very fun, it goes very smooth and is addictive! 100% worth buying it :)"
