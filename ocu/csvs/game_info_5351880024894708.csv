Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDyRtl9o1wY,"I was tired of aim trainers that are boring and ugly, this game is beutiful to the eye, has many scenarios, a great OST, and is very fast and dynamic. This is only a demo, but they keep updating it everyweek, and it's very good. I'm 26 and my nephew is 12, and we love playing it and trying to beat each other's score! I recommend it ^^",Just played your new demo üëç your doing great keep up the good work.,The scoreboard allows you to challenge your friends to see who makes the max score,"Really fun to play and try to beat your friends, the mini-games are very enjoyable because they are quick and intuitive. Waiting for the full version to come out!"
