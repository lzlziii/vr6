For me the game was just a room with a background of outer space and text telling me to join the discord. I have no idea how to get in the game and play. Devs, if you see this, please tell me how to get in the game. I still think this is a great game with amazing mods, chill community, and overall just spectacular. But i cant seem to join this game. -monke"
