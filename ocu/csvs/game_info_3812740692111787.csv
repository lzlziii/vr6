I’ll stick to a normal Rubik’s cube. It’s a waste of money",Like they could make the turning better,I gave it a two star because there’s nothing really to do besides solve it if you don’t know how waste of money also it’s hard to move the cube other than that still good game,Let me start off by saying that I’m an avid speed cuber. I love this app. It’s pretty cool despite its jank. My only critique would be that middle layer turns aren’t possible. Please find a way to implement them!,"It works great for what it does, and I'm sure I could get used to it, but one thing I would like that would be a bit hard to make is to allow anything but wrist turns in the hand tracking."
