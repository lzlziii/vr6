I downloaded the whole 15GB AND IT WAS PHENOMENAL. Thank you AmazeVR for making this. The best money spent on a digital content and I'm not even a fan of Megan (but I guess I am now)",Just gives us more heres my wallet!!!,Avoid. Real shame. Its not the full songs. And the camera keeps moving around making you feel sick. Nothing like a concert. Awful controls and weird mini games. Barely any content. And you cant refund even if it doesn't work !
