Been with the game since the early days of AppLab so it's been quite a journey and amazing to see how much it's been developed since inception. I still think it could do with a couple of tweaks here and there though. First piece of advice I have for the devs is please sort out the naming issue that happened on 24/25 Dec. The update ""merged"" the two applications but really just unlocked functionality in the demo app. This makes little sense to me as there was a full version of the game and an application icon for your home page which is now supposed to be ""Black Hole Pool Demo"". I think a lot of people (definitely including myself) don't want to see ""Demo"" there (especially if I PAID for it) and I can't imagine it's much work for the devs to change that. Next, I would like to move on to the pacing of the game modes. They are very slow. Back in the day, I would simply play practise mode and just practice all day long but with the introduction of the game modes, I like playing against people or the AI. However, I find the game to be toooo slow. AI & Opponent turns take too long and I would love to see the option for a timed mode where the AI & opponent can hurry up a little bit. It doesn't have to be standardised as people shouldn't be rushed but for those of us who'd want a quick game, I'd like to see the option so that turns move quicker. Lastly, I don't like the lobbying process of multiplayer at the moment. If I am playing against the AI or practising, it's super invasive to have someone just be hitting balls on the next table (with no option to turn that sound off) saying ""someone is waiting for a ranked match"". I'd like to see the option to only be matchmade with multiplayers IF you choose that game mode and to be left alone in peace if you choose not to. But aside from that, this game has the potential to be my fav. Edit: Devs heard my feedback and implemented it in a very slick way but sadly, the wristwatch controls dont work. Also, please put in a safeguard against people just NOT playing their turn, forcing you to quit (or waste your time if not quitting) and incur a loss. Tbh, this should already have been thought of beforehand. Something like a turn timer, extend it to 3 minutes to give ample choice for strategy but prevent people from wasting time or else they themselves forfeit. I already suspected this would be an issue but its happening MUCH sooner than I thought it would. Still, perfect mechanics and great experience. Hoping they perfect the experience in the coming weeks.","I was thrilled to see that OQ2 had a pool game. I had to go through App Labs to get it. It’s in BETA. However, it seems super awesome. Physics are on point. I sit in a chair and lean on my left leg with my elbow while playing… seems like you’re right there on the edge of the pool table that way. It’s definitely worth the money. Don’t be fooled by the “Beta” thing. It’s pretty awesome. I’ve had it for about 6 months, and I’ve seen the updates and changes. It is an awesome game. You won’t be disappointed, even if you’re hard to please or you may feel skeptical. Get it!","It's not 5 stars yet but it could definitely be there. I hope developers have plans to improve it further. 1) controls are clumsy at the moment... having cue glued to my hands feels weird, it would be better if it felt like spear from blade and sorcery, something that can be put down and picked up, or maybe ability to hold cue with just one hand and have the other hand for gestures in multiplayer I don't have much experience playing real pool, but for me it was mainly hanging out with friends and playing pool, it would be great to have more social features in the game. 2) being able to walk around the table freely in a form of better avatars, Nintendo style floating chest, hands and head is probably enough 3) having spectators in the game, 2 players might be playing but couple more might be in the game just to watch it and hang out It also feels better when everything is game is physical, cue should collide with table, placing ball should also be more natural... like placing with hand and maybe adjusting it with cue, something like that pool table in Half Life Alyx","Coming from a person who shoots billiards just about every day... this game is awesome. I was one of the first to try the beta versions which needed a lot of improvements which they have made updates to and it is now easily one of my favorite daily games to play on VR. For only having 270 players on the ranked leaderboards, you can find a match almost instantly or within 5 minutes of requesting one which is pretty cool, and the game is only growing more. In addition to being fun and allowing me to get my pool fix without going to the bar, this game has also helped me improve upon real-life masse/english shots. It's incredibly realistic. It's not perfect, but it has definitely helped me practice real life situations. Of course there is still room for improvements to make this game even better and build something extraordinary (such as new features, felt colors, rooms, avatars, etc), and I can't wait to see what they come up with. Pros/Tips - I tried playing standing up, and although it would make more sense, I find this to be one of the very few games playing sitting down. It is VR after all, if you want to shoot real pool, play on an actual table, but for VR I prefer to play this sitting down. - On the quest, there just isn't full body tracking, so you'll soon come to realize that you'll have to make shots with your hands above your face and in front of you to get accurate tracking and be able to adjust your power for shots accordingly. - If you try shooting behind your back (which only has like one power speed, full power), I found it helpful that when shooting, to move your body ""into"" to shot as you do it and you will not lose tracking as easily. You also have to do it quickly in one motion and not spend too much time fiddling with the back and forth power. Improvements/Feedback - Need voice chat - Oculus avatars - More pool halls - 2 v 2 - Different rules (scratch on 8 ball loses, call 8 pocket, need to shoot a solid first to be a solid off the break)","The last update breaks the game, makes you download the demo and does not load the purchased game, also does not let you access YouTube, the keyboard does not come out, a disaster. Update : Thanks to the developer for his quick response, now I will go to Discord to expose the problem, I am still the same, 2 applications, and the ""demo"" opens, although it has all the functionalities. This update that ""joins"" the 2 versions is not very intuitive. Thanks anyway"
