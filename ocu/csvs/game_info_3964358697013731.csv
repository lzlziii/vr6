Super cool concept. Only issue is I haven’t really been able to play the game yet because I can’t get past the training. Most of the training exercises seem impossible to pass and it gets frustrating because I just want to get to the actual game. Otherwise, the game itself looks really cool. I can’t wait to pass the training exercises and see more!"
