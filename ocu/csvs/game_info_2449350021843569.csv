Every class is satisfying to use, easy to pick up and hard to master. The raw physics are brilliant ('nuff said). The campaign's difficulty varies from pretty easy to a great challenge, each taking a suitable amount of time to work through. If you did work through the camoaign before reviewing, you'd also know that the cosmetics are NOT overpriced (the last tournament gets enough for almost the entire shop) and the AI themselves are actually pretty good and adaptable. The online is well balanced also, with no class destroying any others. The best thing about the game is the community though. Every one I've met has been fun, and more than happy to share advice if they are skilled. The developers are committed and listen to the players, and the support the community offers to them is great. This is my favourite game I have at the moment: definitely give it a try!","I love this game but the most fun thing is usually the multiplayer but when I get on I usually see 5-10 people playing but other than that, amazing great game (edit:this game has boosted it's players recently and I've loved this game more than any other vr game and I 100% recommend it to you)","This game is amazing, barely any nerfs needed. (Except samurai nerf it plz) With time, each and every class can be used to their full potential, making the combat intense between any two people. The fact that every class has a downside equal to the other classes makes the combat even more fair yet fun, the single player mode is just as hard, the ai of the enemies is very well made, and the weapon handling corresponds to the weapons well. One of my favorite things to do is deflecting waves of bullets from ranged attacks as ninja.",Whoever says this game is trash they don‚Äôt even know what they are talking about. great players great community great quality great everything! if you buy it you won‚Äôt play anything else like me. Short version buy this you won‚Äôt regret it :),"W game that actually requires skill, it has lots of classes and sandbox is really fun if you have friends to play with (you don't lol). You don't really see much 1v1 games often but this one shines like a star. I love Ironlights, good job. üëçüëçüòÅ"
