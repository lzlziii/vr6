Cajal's Dream,"Cajal's Dream features a flight through a forest of 150 computationally generated cortical neurons set to spherical sound. By emphasizing the aesthetics of realistic neuronal morphologies, Cajal’s Dream is an artistic, relaxing and an educational experience. The featured neurons were generated using the TREES toolbox in MATLAB (www.treestoolbox.org). Their morphologies follow optimal wiring considerations that are typical for neural architectures. Therefore, the artificial neurons closely resemble those of the mammalian cortex because general principles of neuronal arborization were implemented in the virtual growth process. This experience was previously exhibited in various forms as an art piece called Computational Cajal at e.g. the ZKM in Karlsruhe and the Centre Pompidou in Paris.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing","Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity, Educational, Relaxation/Meditation",English,1.0,MW Software,MW Software,http://www.mws.biz/,"Apr 7, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4976021995810085/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4976021995810085&r=1, https://www.mws.biz/CajalsDream/privacy.html",477.3 MB,✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨GOOD FOR ME GOOD FOR YOU✨✨✨✨✨✨✨,I like pretty particle VR experiences.
