Range Day VR,Range Day VR is an early access game and updated regularly with new content and fixes. Range Day VR is designed to give players a taste of what an actual gun range is like while letting players explore iconic realistic firearms without danger of shooting the family cat. Compete against other players in challenging timed events. Range Day VR features several authentic firearm models as we have obtained permission from the manufactures for use in game. We also have plenty of other fantasy and facsimile modern firearms to expand your sandbox destruction as well. More than one is always more fun. While Range Day VR will initially launch as a single player game to begin with it has always been our intention from the beginning of the games design to implement cross platform multiplayer experiences. -Multiple indoor and outdoor ranges in various day and night settings. -More than 40 weapons to shoot. More added frequently. subscribe to beta's at support@invidioustudios.com,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Arcade, Shooter, Simulation",English,1.42,Invidious Studios,Invidious Studios,https://invidiousstudios.com/range-day-vr,"Apr 1, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3628784440523542/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3628784440523542&r=1, https://invidiousstudios.com/oculus-privacy-policy",Terms of Service,2.98 GB,"I loaded this app up and was fairly blown away by what it is. Simply put, it‚Äôs a gun range simulation. Nothing more, nothing less. You pick your range, gun, ammo, and target and shoot till you‚Äôre tired. With ammo and range prices these days, this app is amazing. Perfect? Not really. Satisfying? Absolutely. Probably the most practical app on the Quest, and will be the reason why I am using my Quest more. This scratches that itch so much better than other gun range apps I have tried. Well done üëç BTW I have been a Quest user for years and just now came across it. It should not have been so difficult to find. What‚Äôs up with that?","The game is great when it comes to realism and gunplay, the only thing i don't like is the Teleport movement and how you cannot grab guns off of the wall",Extreme lack of settings so some things are not able to be changed but guns are decent. Edit: AFTER YOU USE A FEW GUNS AND FIRE A AUTOMATIC OR BURST WEAPON IT WILL LAG THE GAME ; I RECOMMEND THE OWNERS TO OPTIMIZE THE GAME AND FIX THIS HUGE BUG BUT FUN GAME. Has a lot of potential aswell. note: this lag only appears in small enclosed maps like in door ranges etc,"Ya.. It's not without its glitches, but it is worth.. All unlocked. Just 16 ranges and alot of firearms and scopes.. Just learn and practice.. Propping your forearm agenst the front of controller is better than double grip. (Emerssion thing I guess) I like the yellow dot scope.. Sound is grest... I hope there are more updates addons??? Thank you to everyone involved with Range Day VR and bringing it to the Quest..",just not good game
