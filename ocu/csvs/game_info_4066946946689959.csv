Bucknell Virtual Experience,"The Bucknell Virtual Experience transports you into an immersive world that lets you see what makes Bucknell unique — from our high-tech labs and learning spaces to our spacious facilities for athletics and recreation. As you explore, you can stop at any of the 10 interactive exhibits — each featuring a helpful audio introduction, stunning photos and never-before-seen 360-degree videos shot on campus. But these exhibits don’t float in an empty digital space. Look left, right, up and down to spot beautifully rendered details taken from real life. You’ll see downtown Lewisburg’s three-globe lampposts, clock and Campus Theatre. You’ll see the cherry trees from Malesardi Quad, the Rooke Science Center dome and the iconic clock tower atop Bertrand Library. Don’t just imagine yourself at Bucknell.
