I like the hand eye coordination challenge this game presents and that the levels are hard without being impossible. Would be cool to see public multiplayer matches in the future instead of just direct connect.","Except for Blacktop Hoops, all basketball shooting games in the AppLab — including this one — suffer from a poorly executed shooting mechanism that is far from realistic. This game is more frustrating than it is fun. Definitely not worth $15."
