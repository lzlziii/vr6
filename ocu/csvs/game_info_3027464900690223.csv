Volta,"Volta is a new way to experience music. Transport yourself into the mind of your favorite artist as they perform live in an audio-reactive world. In Volta, the bass of the kick drum transforms into a ripple spreading across a galactic landscape around you - every note of a synthesizer triggers a multi-colored ribbon streaking across a vapor wave Sonoran desert - your favorite artist surrounds you as crystal fragments that literally shatter around you as the sing louder and louder. In Volta, experience itself is an artist's canvas - dance, play, interact and create alongside them in their universe.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Music",English,0.6.46,Volta Audio,Volta Audio,https://volta-xr.com/,"Mar 30, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3027464900690223/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3027464900690223&r=1, https://www.volta-xr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Privacy-Policy_vMR_240321.pdf",204.6 MB,The new way and new attractivity for the virtual reality.,Can't wait to see how this app grows.
