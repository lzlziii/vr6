It really is a nice game, with having to work up strategies but playing with AI teammates sucks because you can’t communicate with them! P.S. NEEDS UPDATE SOON!

Fireballs, storms, ice walls, teleports AND MUCH MORE!!! In addition there are different powers offering several advantages. And different classes like healer, protector and attacker.
