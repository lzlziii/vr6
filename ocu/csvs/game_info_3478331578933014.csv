Labyrinth deLux - A Crusoe Quest,"In Labyrinth deLux - A Crusoe Quest you are space trucker Robin on your way back to planet Earth. By your side - your ever helpful virtual assistant Friday. When caught in a time-loop you happen to wake up in a temple-like space. The only way out of this cube and to the safety of your space truck is to (re)align the laser and point at mirrors, prisms and other reflective surfaces to open the doors and perhaps find answers to your questions or to a truth beyond your imagination.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Puzzle, Space/Universe",English,3.5.0,K5 Factory GmbH,K5 Factory GmbH,https://labyrinthdelux.com/,"Mar 2, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3478331578933014/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3478331578933014&r=1, https://k5mediagroup.com/terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy-ldl/",345.4 MB,"I just bought the full version and it goes way beyond the demo. I'm only a few rooms past the demo and already my brain hurts. It's easy to get lost. I love the Escher feel of up is everywhere at once. Great game, great puzzles and I like the retro graphics. And thank you for keeping the price low. I often pass on great games because of the cost. (Now, where was that door again?)","First impressions review here: https://youtu.be/GxWHHOwxJnE There's something very satisfying about moving those heavy mirrors around to create a chain of light to escape each room, and the chatter between yourself and F.R.I.D.A.Y is always entertaining!","Great and engaging story, especially the banter between Robin and Friday is quite amusing. The puzzles are hard enough for a casual playthrough and the perspective changes aren't as disorienting as I first expected. The visual style is also quite unique for VR and I love it.",Engaging story and immersive environments with challenging puzzles. Great puzzler that I have included in my top 10 app lab list: https://youtu.be/8ZG7KHOOan8,"Lasers, mirrors and prisms, you can do some pretty cool things with them. I really have a lot of fun with this game. And I love the characters in the story. They give the game a unique touch."
