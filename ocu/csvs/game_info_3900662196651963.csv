Sin Breaker Rig,"Sin Breaker Rig (SBR) is a VR first-person bullet-hell shooter. Player becomes Kanon, an ace pilot in the SBR rescue team, ready to explore this machine-dominated world. Perform badass, anime-inspired moves to obliterate your foes. We utilize the latest hand-tracking technology, therefore all actions are done without the need of a controller. One can simply push the arm forward to release a fireball, or snap the fingers to trigger an arcanic flame that seeks nearby enemies. We also introduce a new way to move across vast terrain. By using one's own body to induce movement, the player feels more immersed and less prone to VR sickness. You can now easily strafe to dodge incoming missiles, while firing with both hands at different directions.",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Hand Tracking,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Shooting","English, Chinese (Taiwan)",1.0,Art Zero,Art Zero,https://www.facebook.com/SBRxVR,"Nov 16, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3900662196651963/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3900662196651963&r=1, https://madturtle84.github.io/sbr.static/privacy",1.22 GB,The learning curve of vr is like boom this is cool‚Ä¶ then you keep playing and stumble upon games like this and actually realize this is the type of intuitive gameplay you envisioned having access to as a child and it‚Äôs finally come to reality‚Ä¶ thanks so much for creating this game I looked at it and I bought it hesitating can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds for this release üïäÔ∏èüî•üî•üî•,"I really hope your working on this game still, it looks very amazing, I was literally thinking VR needed a game like this and a stumbled upon it. I would love for this to be finished one day ‚Ä¶.only complaint is the left hand is facing backwards but honestly I‚Äôm willing to wait",amazing game,"It features excellent movement and experience, fully utilizing the hand recognition capabilities. It's a game that Quest players must purchase, and it's definitely worth it.","25% off referral code at the bottom in my YouTube link I really like the game and how good the handtracking feels.....this is definitely the best movement system for handtracking but definitely needs some work and make it a little less sensitive or at least have sensitivity options in the menu.... i love the movement and how you can dodge stuff with your intense speed like your in a anime like dbz, personally I do boxing dodge movements to dodge projectiles and it makes me feel so cool doing it. the game is a bit much for the price and it being short but still alot of fun...I hope you guys expand on the game and add more playable characters and custom hands like different gloves and cybernetic hands....would be cool to have different elements like air and electricity, would be sick to throw lightnings bolts and strikes or air pushing and tornadoes.. if you guys need a beta tester for the game to help improve on it i would love to, I have tested for a few different vr games over the last few years while I dont 100% agree with the price (now in this early state) either way I would still recommend getting it beacuse of how cool and unique it feels and its the only fast paced handtracking anime fighting game in existence at the moment https://youtu.be/NAZTrb97ay8"
