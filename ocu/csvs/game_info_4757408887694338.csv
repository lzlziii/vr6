Get this game. This game is absolutely amazing and the people in game most are so nice to help you figure things out. It’s really like a small family. Get this game . Don’t even hesitate because this should be a 50 dollar game with a subscription that’s how much it has to offer . 10 stars for this game no less .,"I've played a lot of multiplayer vr games and I have to say that this is one of the best ones out there. I first started with a trail because I was sceptical but don't let the pictures in the store page fool you. This game has extremely deep mechanics and concepts. The magic system is unlike any I've ever seen in a video game and the questing will have you scratching your head craving for answers. It's like a combination of rust, dayz and world of warcraft with its own unique elements. The mixture of rpg progression and open world pvp combat really creates a long lasting experience. Some members of the community are really helpful and friendly while others just want to pvp and kill people. There is some rivalry in the player base as hostile people can attack you on sight but the game allows you to join a private server if you want to play alone or only with your friends. My experience with PvP so far has ranged from being a low level victim to defending my newly made friends from evil bandits. The PvP is very skill based and I've seen one player take on multiple enemies and win. But beware, a lot of people will be salty if you kill them and THEY WILL HUNT YOU DOWN. It's a very entertaining game and I would rate it much higher if I could!","As a kid I played Rune scape, I loved the multiplayer magic and battle aspects about it. Ever since they came out with Virtual reality headsets I’ve wanted Rune scape as a game I’ve tried both Township tale and Zenith and nether of them can compete against this game. I love this game and hope to see it grow more.","arguably one of the best games on quest at the moment, takes a bit to get into, and learning your first spell is quite a chore. the game becomes significantly better once you get to level 40 and unlock all of the spells."
