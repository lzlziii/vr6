There making it easier for you to fit the blocks in. There also trying to add mor colters blocks! This game is great I highly recommend! Update, 22/AUG/10. Came back to this game, nothing changed since the last update. That was a while ago. The maker of this game seemed like he had big plans for this game, but sadly nothing ever came. This might of been because really nobody really plays this game. But it lacks content. 7.5 out of ten. Still you should Buy it.",The concept is simple and actually brilliant. but the developers seem to have stopped all development on it.,"The app is very good and works great. However, it would be nice if it supported video captions/subtitles.","Watching and sharing YOUTUBE video or build some thing with blocks with your friend on a virtual table, I'd want to say it's a interesting idea!","I just bought the game, it’s already amazing lol"
