I find this game to be fun, challenging and very rewarding! Also, Korean. If you like games based on time management, rewards, food and drink, this game is for you!","Adorable game! Pros: + Funny plot and awesome characters + Amazing atmosphere + Fantastic combination of mechanics + It is both challenging and calming + Simple but cozy graphic design + Upgrades Cons: - It takes a while to set the hight and your position inside the shop during sitting playing. I recommend it to everyone, one of my fav VR games so far","So fun. It gets so challenging and quite frantic, it feels a lot like actual food service, with less of the nitty gritty. I actually love these fish cakes in real life and highly recommend them!"
