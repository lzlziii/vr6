UPDATE: Absolutely loving the new update for Paradiddle on Meta Quest 2! ü•Å The devs really listened to the community and fixed all the issues. The tracking is spot-on, and the sound quality is just mind-blowing. It's like having a drum set in your living room, but without annoying the neighbors. If you're into drumming or just want a fun way to let off some steam, this game is a must-try. 10/10, would recommend! üåü","Since I loaded Paradiddle (after discovering it by searching for a drumming app on Quest2 on the inet) and getting into it, all other apps I bought before this have lost their shine. What a blast!! The visuals, the feel, the sound, the response, the customizing options, the note highway with levels going from Easy to Expert, the lessons - I‚Äôm having SO MUCH fun playing to songs I imported to the app that meanwhile I believe Paradiddle is the only really good reason to have bought a Quest2 headset! I‚Äôm sort of an advanced beginner at drumming and trust this is not only fun, but it‚Äôs actually taking me further. I haven‚Äôt yet explored all capabilities, but if there is something I wonder about, they have good documentation (for example a detailed guide on how to set up pedals), and the user community on Discord is very active and helpful. Thanks to all this, I‚Äôm having a super experience and can recommend this app 100%.",Really loved discovering this game. It‚Äôs actually teaching me how to play drums and is really fun in the process!,"Love this app. I can't drum very well but love bashing through the tunes. Easy, medium mode plenty for me at the moment but who knows. I do wish it had a trainer mode (not lessons) where you could mark out a section and play it on repeat until you master it, maybe 50% or 75% speed. So.. thanks to the programmer, great job and thanks to those who have made additional songs available, if I work out how to do it I'll add in some 60s stuff, kinks, Beatles, stones ...etc. which are more my era. Update: Still playing after a couple of months and can now play quite a few songs on expert mode. I've also made a few song trainers, using a music score editor, to learn the actual drum parts on some of my favourite songs including ""All right now - Free"" and ""Zombie - The Cranberries"" which have been great to master syncing my foot and hands together. One thing I've noticed, and I think it's a problem with my room lighting, is that my drumsticks sometimes go haywire particularly on some faster stuff. If anyone else is creating songs.. do you know if you can either Mark the hi hat note on the note highway to show it's meant to be played open.. or Force the sound to play open regardless of whether the hi hat foot pedal is pressed or released?"
