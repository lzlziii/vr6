This game is easily playable for new players and i downloaded this game three weeks ago and I’ve already put a record on my distance and nobody in my family can beat it not even me, but the thing is you hit home runs so easily, I barely have to swing for a home run and i am right handed,the graphics are insane, and the game runs well but if you don’t have the best internet connection, as you lose connection to the server, you lose your bats, but overall this game is recommended to any baseball fans out there."
