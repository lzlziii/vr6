A CHAINSAW? A YO-YO? Is that a SHARK ON A FREAKIN‚Äô STICK? ‚óè Want to just chill in your armchair? That‚Äôs OK! Switch to CHILL difficulty and take it easy, couch potato. ‚óè Want an extra challenge? Just switch the game difficulty to OVERDRIVE! (Nice knowing you BTW) ‚óè But you‚Äôre not done yet... Go back and fly challenging side missions to unlock an entire SQUADRON of diverse pilots. ‚óè Shooty Skies Overdrive is cross-buy enabled for Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Arcade, Shooting","English, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Venezuela)",1.10.85270,Mighty Games Group,Mighty Games Group,https://shootyskiesoverdrive.com/,"Jul 2, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2632963266829659/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2632963266829659&r=1, https://shootyskiesoverdrive.com/privacy/index.html",Terms of Service,1.58 GB,"Idk what this genre is but u hold a little aerial fighter and move it with your hand like a toy, dodging and shooting enemies. Gets very challenging, flow state almost feels like a kind of Tai chi. Very cool. If you like yuki play this game and if you like this play yuki.","Visit linktr,ee/gaving7095 for 25 % off many Oculus titles üòÄ This is a fun shooter which gets you moving about, fairly priced. I only don‚Äôt give it 5 stars because, to me, it was limited lifespan & not much incentive to replay.",Epic,"Games awesome, it's like a VR Space Invaders or 1945. Really don't have many complaints, it's challenging enough that you won't just easily run through it first attempt, but easy enough that it isn't frustrating. However, it's really lacking on levels, a few good hours into the game and you will just be replaying the same thing over and over.","Love this game. So much fun. The graphics are funny and the gameplay is very challenging, even on the easiest level. Don‚Äôt hesitate. Get this!"
