Floor Plan 2,"*** Now includes Backside Story, a massive expansion with 2+ hours of all-new puzzle gameplay! *** Floor Plan 2 is a comedy adventure inspired by escape rooms, packed with more puzzles than you can fit in an elevator. On your first day of work, the boss sends you on an errand to retrieve a lost treasure that will turn the company's fortunes around. And good news: it's somewhere in the building! Just use the elevator down the hall. Oh, and by the way, each floor is a gateway to another world, nobody speaks your language, and time and space are fluid. OK good luck! Features: • Use your elevator to solve mind-bending puzzles in a series of connected escape rooms • Step out onto each floor, explore, and meet bizarre characters • Revisit completed puzzles to find new, remixed challenges waiting for you • Now with 6+ hours of hand-crafted, charming-as-heck gameplay • Built exclusively for VR, and designed to be comfortable for everyone Developed with love by Turbo Button in Los Angeles.

I love the comedic characters and the perfect challenge and fun combination of the puzzles. And all for a good price. Definitely a buy 👍 25 off: bit(dot)ly/OculusDisc Replace the (dot) with a period And please like the post it really helps!!!,"This game has been my favorite since it came out in 2021.. ever since I finished it I was waiting for the next one and it’s finally here! I just finished the new one and it exceeded all of my expectations and it’s a spectacular extension, one thing I would change is if you drop something it should spawn back in the elevator and not just stay on the floor. I know it makes the game more realistic, but sometimes I don’t notice that I dropped it instead of putting it in my pouch and then when I need it I have to search all the floors and rooms to find it. PLEASE MAKE MORE!!! Maybe even a multiplayer so you can play with friends and family? Thank you for creating such a great game! Keep it up!","After playing this game, it needs like more things to do like if all the characters from the last elevator is that we came through and then more red fluffy’s and then yeah, and then like if somebody were to try to take over puzzle words, and all that that be a lot more And it’s like if there were only one, I feel like there should be like eight levels, and then like all the characters trying to work together plz do🙏🏽","No coupon, a real review with only total adoration of Floor Plan 2. Can't believe I hadn't reviewed this game, it's one of my absolute favorites. So much so last week, when I was in a bout of game ennui, someone asked ""well, what would you WANT to play?"" And I said ""Floor Plan 2. But I can't. Because I finished it."" And TWO DAYS LATER, we got the update. I take it as a personal miracle. This is the brightest, least creepy puzzle game you will find. Adorable characters, great, colorful environments, terrific sense of humor (if occasionally juvenile), challenging puzzles and wild imagination make it one of the most fun games I've played on any platform. I can't recommend it enough. My only issue is an aside to the developers. After doing the overtime in the original two elevators, I wasn't able to go collect the Harries in the third location for some reason. Whether me or a glitch, I hope that's ironed out. That's minor and after you finish the game after the game. Just a wonderful, wonderful game and experience. Makes me happy to think about it.",It’s a great game and I recommend it to anyone. There is an issue that I have it’s in the (edit->)west tower: I can not get the shoe because the boat is on the other side and I cannot get it therefore I can not complete the game (also edit..) I still have an issue because the fisherman is on the other side of the crocodile and he won’t fall on the croc so I think there should be a way to refill the lake to bring him over
