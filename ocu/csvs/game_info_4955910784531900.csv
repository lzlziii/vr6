Vasoo Be Together,"Vasoo is an entertainment focused, social virtual space that is completely immersive and interactive. We have different realistic and charming worlds inside our application where small groups of friends and family can hang out together and engage in a wide range of fun activities. Choose from a list of 3D avatars to represent yourself in the different worlds and use them to move around, interact with in-game objects, and mirror other in-person actions. Enjoy our beautiful immersive 3D environments and talk to your friends seamlessly in real time as if they are right next to you.

The graphics are really nice and the environments are different and refreshing from the other VR apps I've tried. I love that we can stream 360 video content in here including YouTube videos and watch them together with people. You can also download and login the app through a mobile device and hangout in the metaverse with friends who don't own a VR set, which makes this app way cooler.","Please add more content and environments, including a movie cinema."
