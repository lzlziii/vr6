This game has incredible potential but the controls need a complete rework ..vehicles need weight .. Otherwise great graphics great feel of speed & the UI is obviously a work in progress Please change the control system & add a feeling of weight to the vehicle & you would have a fantastic game on your hands Cheers Update No way to exit or restart a game 🤷🏽‍♂️ Been playing a few weeks now & while the control method is very difficult to get the hang of ..once you do it's fantastic & I stand corrected Think of it as controlling a fighter jet & set the controller on your knee as a base ...it will take a while (2 weeks for me lol) but it's worth it The U.I needs completing but all in good time no doubt Great game Cheers 5 stars 😁 Update .. Refinery level is absolutely insane ... Not for VR amateurs .. This game is just getting better & better ..the graphics ..the speed ..the twists & turns ..just incredible 😁👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Update 11/08/2023 just noticed my vehicle is breaking for me ???? How can I turn that off ..never had that before ?? Otherwise getting better & better Cheers,"I really hope the devs will add some of these 1. Single player racing option 2. For the map with the thunder and dark clouds add a rain effect on the windows. 3. A map where you're underwater 4. (One of my favorites) you should add an echo effect when you're under things like in a tunnel or a cave. 5. Different ship designs instead of colors only 6. Add achievements, like getting first place on every map, doing a certain number of barrel rolls, reaching a certain speed, winning a certain number of races, and so on. 7. A map where you're in the forest and have a shortcut where you can go through a waterfall into a cave, but have a sign that has shortcut so people know 8. For your ship you can add accessories on top of your ship like a trophy. 9.add a subway station map.","The graphics are just HORRIBLE! The controllers are MADDENING! But I have to recommend this to anyone looking for a thrill. Because it’s thrilling when you know what you’re doing. I knew what I was doing for the first few stages. Once you have a flow going it’s outrageously fun. However my flow stopped significantly early on and I didn’t have it in me to master the controls, which by the way make sense for sure. Don’t blame the developers because I think mastering the control mechanics is what this game is all about. Really weird levels with random subjects. They look terrible. If you want to give this a go, use this link below. I only give honest reviews.

Omega Pilot is definitely one of my favorite VR games, and easily the best racing game on Quest! The motion controls may be weird at first, but are in my opinion one of the most intuitive and rewarding control schemes. Also i am really fond of the new endurance mode. Perfect for Youtube-Gameplay! ;) The only complaint i have at the moment is that the 5 new tracks are a little uninspired and the invisible walls feel really weird and restictive. Melange in particular is a mess. There is no clear direction in the design of the track and you constantly crash into an invisible wall which just feels like being there. IDK it just feels rushed to me. But still this game brought me hours of fun on Steam and i hope for even more hours here on Quest 2! Cheers!","Omega pilot is awesome!! It's the closest thing to wipeout 2097 I've ever experienced in VR. The controls are a bit confusing at first, but once you get used to them I have to say that driving is enormously satisfying. The sense of speed and physics are spectacular. You compete with the ghosts of other players in the general leaderboard, among other things, based on your times, ghosts of your level are placed and as you improve, you find opponents who have done better times. Lots of tracks, customizable gloves and liveries to unlock. Standalone graphics are great. Unfortunately (unless I have not yet discovered otherwise) there is only one type of ship, which can be tuned through interactive commands in the cockpit. Looking forward to more content via update or dlc. If you like the genre I highly recommend you buy it."
