There‚Äôs only one bad thing about this game and that‚Äôs when you go search for tapes because after a minute the atmosphere is killed and it gets annoying. But the Ôøºhumor alone makes it up ten fold and not to mention a lot of what you do affects later parts of the story. And it‚Äôs this has been the only vr game I‚Äôve wanted more of after the story.,"Wow. This game is excellent thus far! I‚Äôve only played about 2 hours of it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely creepy and a little scary, but I‚Äôm also a huge wimp with even mild horror or suspense. The puzzles are easy, and I only lost Miss Jazzical because I was lazy, lol. Graphics fit the genre perfectly- retro 80s with a hint of erie detail. Characters- 9.5/10 Voice acting- 10/10 Storytelling- 9/10 Design- 10/10 Gameplay-8.5/10 (likely just a personal issue) (Personal) fear factor- 7/10 (Average person) fear factor- 4/10 I definitely recommend buying this game!","Killer Frequency is an extremely amazing game that makes you truly feel all the tension and suspense that all you lovers of Slasher Films are dying for. I often don‚Äôt write reviews for games I play as I usually like to simply play the game, say to myself ‚Äúthat game was pretty good‚Äù, and then move on with my day. That being said there are a select few that I feel deserve to have great things said about them and this game has just been added to that list. Two of my favorite kinds of games are horror and puzzle games. Killer Frequency perfectly captures both of those aspects and, where I have seen many other games fail, neither topic overpowers the other. There is the exact right amount of fear and puzzle solving to make an amazing game. A great thing about this game is the replay-ability. Throughout the game, you as the player have to try to guide callers through life or death scenarios which, as you may have guessed, could end up in them getting killed. The thing about this is, you can‚Äôt simply return to a puzzle or part of the game. If someone dies, they are dead, and you don‚Äôt get another chance to save them or solve that puzzle unless you play through the game a second time. This also means that if there is a puzzle you are struggling with, you can technically continue the game without solving it, though it could end up taking a person‚Äôs life. The story of this game is also very well thought out and polished. Through calling different people in the game, you slowly start piecing together the killers motives and backstory. You may see tiny clues that, although you don‚Äôt realize it, are crucial in understanding what really happened in the past. These tiny clues start causing some gears to turn in your head and make some theories. Though none of this will be completely confirmed by the game until the very end. The way the story is laid out in terms of progression caused large parts of the story to be pieced together, but they are all in different fragments until the very last moment of the game. This causes all of the suspense to build to one ‚ÄúWOAH‚Äù moment. Truly it is crazy how well this game was put together. All in all this is now one of my favorite VR games and I will definitely be coming back to play it multiple times more. And hopefully (due to the epilogue) there will be a second game. If there is, be assured I will be one of the first in line to get it!","I have only one grip with the game but I‚Äôll get to that at the end, everything else though has been fun and great and enjoyable. Story is the kinda cliche fun you get in the old 80s-90s horror flick vibe which is perfectly since that‚Äôs what the game is going for, although the twist did get me and surprised me a lil. The fact that almost if not literally everything is interactable and can be grabbed, touched or picked up and used is also fun to just mess around with stuff while characters speak, won‚Äôt lie got sidetracked at times and lost track of what was said lol Everything about the game is great, however my one, big issue I had wasn‚Äôt even of the gameplay or the story itself, but the settings to play. There‚Äôs no smooth turn, and with janky drifting sticks atm it‚Äôs hard to play and move around when I‚Äôm constantly turning left or right without moving an inch, of course I can just use my own body but I mostly play sitting down being I have a short ceiling and fear whacking my hands up against it. All I‚Äôm curious about if any tweaks or updates will allow the option of smooth turning for those who like that option. Other than that this game is a 5/5."
