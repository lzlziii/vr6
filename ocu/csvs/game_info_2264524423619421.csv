I find it to be meditative and immensely satisfying. ü•∞ But for me, as the puzzles get harder I become increasingly frustrated ‚Äî to the point that I actually requested a refund! But I had enjoyed the easy puzzles SO MUCH that I couldn't get the game out of my head, and a few weeks later I bought the game again! What I do now is play until I get frustrated, then skip the rest of the puzzles on that level and move on to another level. But it would be nicer if I never had to get frustrated at all. Developers: Is there some way you could allow us to only see puzzles at our preferred level of difficulty? For example, add a setting to toggle the display of Easy | Medium | Hard puzzles. That way someone like me could limit the selection to easy puzzles and just enjoy breezing through them without frustration.","It‚Äôs a wonderful VR puzzle game. It‚Äôs a great game if you don‚Äôt want to stand up, and just sit back and relax. I can‚Äôt wait for Quest 3 to come out with its full Color pass through. I really hope they will update this game along with Q3‚Äôs full color pass through!",Very relaxing with good puzzles.,First thing I play when I get on. Only weird thing is that sometimes I have to stand to grab things that would otherwise be under me. That‚Äôs the only complaint.,The 5 star reviews are all true! Fantastic puzzle game. Thanks developers‚Ä¶we‚Äôll done!‚ù§Ô∏è
