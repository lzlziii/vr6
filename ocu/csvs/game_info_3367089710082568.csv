Star-Stuff,"Invite your friends to meet you in space! Star-Stuff is an immersive experience created to remind immersants of their fundamental connection to humanity and the Universe. This VR artwork brings two random immersants together remotely to give a new perspective on themselves, humanity, and the Universe. Floating in space, your hands are transformed into a myriad of constellations while stars emanate from your heart, orbiting your body in a mesmerizing cosmic dance. Moving and playing with the stars, you form a galaxy unique to you and your movement. Time seems to stand still as eons flash by in this meditative experience. Another person joins the experience, flickering into view in the form of another constellation. The gravitational effects of your bodies guide the stars, forming a collaborative and dynamic sculpture in space as you play and dance together. In Star-Stuff, looking to the stars allows us to see deeper inward, to be a way for the Universe to know itself.",3+,"Multiplayer, Single User","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity, Social, Space/Universe",English,2022.10,John Desnoyers-Stewart,John Desnoyers-Stewart,http://ispace.iat.sfu.ca/project/star-stuff/,"Jan 24, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3367089710082568/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3367089710082568&r=1, http://ispace.iat.sfu.ca/projects/star-stuff-privacy-policy/",171.0 MB,âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨BODYðŸ’«ðŸŒˆMINDâœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨,What you see is what you get here. Pretty cool little app that allows you to move little bits of light (stars) around by moving your hands. There's a bunch of ways in which the devs could branch off and add to or modify this app. I wish I were imaginative and creative enough to come up with some helpful suggestions.,"nice to show to people who doesn't know Vr experience. A little bit limited to experiment, but ok, it's cool :)","This is a hard one to describe. Basically, you float in space surrounded by stars and have a subtle affect on their movement with your hands. I would not call this a game, I would call it a meditative experience. The music is soothing and the experience very relaxing. I use a few apps on Quest 2 for meditation and have now added this for times when I want no guidance but would like to focus on my own thoughts without distraction. Itâ€™s free and does not take up much space, so indulge your curiosity and give it a look.","I loved to be among the stars and play with them! there are so many things you can do, so many points of view! the avatar is also comfortable and fun! can't wait to play with other users"
