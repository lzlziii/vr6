I‚Äôve been eyeballing this game for about 2 years now and finally said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do it!‚Äù And I‚Äôve been kicking my self for not getting it earlier. There seems to be a drifting effect when letting go of the acceleration on turns. Especially if you max out the sensitivity which is what I do cause these vehicles are FAST! And the drifting is awesome! Controls are amazing. U get about 4 schemes but my favorite is tilting the right hand. Music is cool as hell and levels are cool and futuristic. Especially the city ones. I REALLY hope developers are working on a sequel and I have written to them on Twitter about wanting to make music or collab with them. This is EASILY Fzero or wipeout. I HIGHLY recommend the devs create more immersive worlds on the next one. City buildings. Jungles. Etc. The cyber look is cool but it gets old. Which is why I love the city levels. Great job! Get it! And at $7 as of this writing and even at the full price of $10. It‚Äôs well worth it!,"Want to start off with I was very worried when I first paid for it but quickly faded once I got going, I have just started playing but it is a lot of fun and totally not for everyone, some times it feels like I can't roll the controller far enough to turn or slow down enough to turn or something but only some turns and some tracks but totally awesome game , really impressed me","I hesitated buying this... Though it was on my wishlist for a while now. Having nearly 100 games in my library, I wanted a racer. But out of so many games, I had one regret purchase, one failure out of so many was a VR racer. But after playing this game, my faith was restored. The game play, the graphics, the music, and the level of engagement are all well met. Love this game! It brought joy back to my VR experience.","Neat graphics but thats it Poor controls Terrible made tracks with arrow sign blocks HOGGING THE TRACK THAT YOU CAN DRIVE INTO! WHY ARE THERE OBJECTS ON THE TRACK? AND WHY IS THE TRACK BROKEN UP IN PIECES WITH FAKE GAPS THAT KILL YOUR INSANELY DUMB POINTLESS BATTERY, WHEN ITS DRAINED, YOU DIE BUT RESPAWN. WTF","This is a really great game. Love the whole thing really. The speed, the handling, the graphics and the concept. It‚Äôs a good rush for only a few of your pennies üëç Buy it!!!"
