Yupitergrad,"Yupitergrad is the plunger-driven kosmonaut game where you can swing through space station with style all in cell-shaded graphics. Can you believe that grappling hooks is the definitive way of locomotion in place like this? It's one of a kind experience, where VR platformer meets puzzles in a single player campaign, thrills in Time Attack mode and freedom in Gymnasion Mode. * Indiana Jones-like navigation where you use grappling hooks and boosters? It's like a jam and peanut butter combination * Campaign with over 50 levels, wacky plot and a dose of slavic humour and dad jokes; * Time Attack mode where you swing through 50 arcade levels and with leaderboards; * Gymnasion mode - a place where you can swing and train crazy stunts; * Long list of energetic and atmospheric tracks; * Unique dieselpunk-in-space vibe; * 120hz support on Oculus Quest 2. [To start Gymnasion, use the console in the space capsule (the same place where you can start Time Attack Mode) or use on-hand menu]",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Arcade",English,2.6.1,Gamedust,Gamedust,https://gamedust.co/,"Jan 28, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3622969487764448/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3622969487764448&r=1, https://gamedust.co/privacy-policy",1.37 GB,"I love the game and will get the second game, but i feel like the campaign is a little too short, i hope this won’t be an issue in the sequel! An update: i love the second game and it fixes all the issues except one, the yellow gun has no indication that you need it or where is is, otherwise i love the game!","One of my first and favourite games on Quest 2. Love the graphics, feel of gameplay, level design, story, voice acting, humour. The campaign is short but sweet and does a great job introducing the locomotion mechanics. It feels really immersive like being inside a colourful platform game. After two + years I finally completed all time trials! The recent twisted ones were awesome even though they often made me quit out of frustration! Can’t wait for the upcoming sequel.","Just played through even though I played the 2nd one. This one is also so much fun! Lots of extra stuff to do as well outside the campaign. Worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot): b i t , l y / y g r a d 1",The game has great mechanics but the levels appear to have been redesigned with a layer iteration and there is a door which will never open. The game is essentially unplayable at that point. 5stars to 1star real quick. For devs looking to fix this. The level in question starts at 21:30 in this quest walkthrough video: https://youtu.be/UQpToggG8gQ 21:30 - level with altered maps Change: exit from the first buzz saw chamber is a different larger door leading to overhead passages ending in a door that never opens. Using: Quest-1,"Swinging through the cartoon art style of this futuristic soviet space station was a joy. The humour was on point, the swinging felt great, and whilst the game is short it’s paced nicely. I finished it in one play through before heading on to the sequel."
