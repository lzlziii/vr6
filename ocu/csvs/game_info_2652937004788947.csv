Guns'n'Stories: Bulletproof VR,"Guns’n’Stories: Bulletproof is a dynamic VR western shooter that fully immerses players into the ambiance of weird Wild West. Stepping the tangled storyline, you will encounter many intimidating but comical enemies and fight Big Bosses. You will have to shoot aptly and a lot using both hands as well as to use various covers and move actively, avoiding bullets of enemies. You will visit many beautiful locations and will be able to try a big arsenal of weapons under the rhythm of the heavy music, jokes, and cynical humor! Unforgettably vivid cocktail from emotions, in which we’ve added everything to make a player fall out of reality for a while to receive exactly these bright and fresh emotions we’ve only experienced when were kids. Maximally comfortable and user-friendly. You will never feel sick or discomfort during the game. However, you will need a good physical shape to play on the high level of complexity.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Shooting","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish (Spain)","1.0
