There are 8 levels that you work through but when finished you can start the 8 levels over and each time making it a little different and a little harder. I'd like to see this game improved by allowing your character to move and not just stand in one place. Also, there are levels that do not get harder as you play them over a second to the fifth time, which is disheartening. The difficulty from level one to eight really isn't much of a change and then when you start the levels over again, these new levels should be even more difficult than before. The bad guy of level 8 (worth $5000) is probably the easiest of all the levels to clear. It should be the most difficult.","included in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-5q5Zx7n3E A short quick draw western game that aims for a more fun experience opposed to a challenging one. You can clear the stages quickly but since you can keep replaying through the game over and over again the pricetag didn't bother me. If you enjoy the quick draw feature in games like red dead redemption your going to get a kick out of this, and it does mix it up with a mine cart level among others.","This is absolutely worth the price of entry and more. I’ll admit I’m biased since this was one of my faves on the Oculus Go as well, but it’s a blast to play on Quest. It’s a very simple and short game. You play as a bounty killer and go up against a variety of bad guys on a handful of different maps. You earn money for completion of each stage and lose money for “doctors fees” if you die. There are a couple (only a couple) upgrades you can spend money on, and a new game + that changes the maps up a bit (different order, bad guy placement, etc). Once you’ve seen the few maps, you’ve really seen it all - but the simple joy of being a quickdraw gunslinger in the Wild West is pretty dang fun. My only complaint is that there isn’t more! I’d love to see other weapons, upgrades, etc to spend your money on. There isn’t any movement either - you’re completely still except for your hands (which hold your two six shooters). More maps would be cool too. But what’s present in the experience currently is more than worth the couple bucks it cost! Highly recommend if you’re looking to be a gunslinger.",Excellent Quick draw game. Must have for Western fans. Yes the game is very short but for the price you can't complain...hope for new level updates later down the road....,"I love the side swing reload, straight to the point bang bang first. Cant wait for update ,great pick up"
