The Ragmans,"Any way is good to win a battle - attack enemies with swords, axes, shields, hammers, bare hands and firearms. They may be poor warriors, but thanks to their numerical superiority they can surprise. As you gain battle experience, you'll get access to more weapons, such as a large sword, bow, crossbow, revolver, shotgun, machine gun or large-caliber sniper rifle. In addition to the adventure mode, the game also features a custom map editor where you can create your own dream battle scenario.",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Arcade, Fighting",English,0.9,Zen Apps Studio,Seba,https://szlufik.pl/theragmans,"Jun 2, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6305464276159490/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6305464276159490&r=1, https://szlufik.pl/theragmans/PrivacyPolicy/",281.1 MB,Just played through the whole available content in one sitting. It may be short but the entire time I had a smile on my face. Charging in with your boys into combat feels so good. The adventure mode is cleverly set up so that it doesn't skip a step and has some cool mechanics I wasn't prepared for. Overall this game is great. If you add more content you will see the inside of my wallet that's for sure. Also big side ask. But next game be like this but revolutionary line battles. (Thus game rn rocks for what it is though. Thank you!,"28-06-23 New level editor update From a fancy editor, it has been upgraded to a more advanced editor where you can finally make levels at different heights, with the addition of enemy spawn zones and breakable castle doors. It is a major improvement that helps hours of fun. Editor no fail nowüç∫ Rating, deserves half of the fourth star. It is already recommended and ""replayable"" (editor).üëè 05-06-23 First launching day From the trailers it seems attractive, with the potential to create battles for you... but the reality is very short missions, very few missions and a failed editor. Played and finished with 1 hour‚Ä¶. I need 20 levels more!! Maybe a infinite-Ramdom map mode where playing one map and other without to click ‚Äúnext ‚Äú and without change weapons for all them can be nice too. The editor fail, several objects load at different height. If I want to do a battle of archers from towers I can't, because it forces the editor to put ""my doll"" at a low level, and it doesn't allow the editor to place it on a tower to start on it. There are bugs with some pieces that when trying to carry them, the wrists turn on their own and do not let that piece rotate. I suggest being able to place the pieces with buttons and pointer as well and not only manually, so perhaps it would be more precise. The pieces should emit a color that confirms that they are playing well or hooking well with another piece, because sometimes you think it's okay but when loading the map it fails and you lose them... Any discord to share this(solved -added at answer downüëè? If the content improves or the editor is fixed, I update the evaluation.",I just played the whole game yesterday and i loved every second of it. And I was so sad when it was over so i just played de full game two more times. This game is absolutely amazing all it needs is more levels. Please dont leave this game alone and continue to develop it!
