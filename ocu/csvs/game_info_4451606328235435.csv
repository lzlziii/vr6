But trust me it's worth it, even after just a few minutes you will quickly learn and you will have a lot of fun. In the beginning the levels are easy and become difficult as they increase. The last few levels might seem tough at first but trust me, making a mistake to retry a level is incredibly satisfying. The interaction with your friends is both chaotic but also manageable, and as you go through the levels together you will become more and more coordinated. I've been using virtual reality for a long time now, and have tried many games. Usually the nice ones are cheap while there are some really nice ones that cost too much. When I downloaded this game I didn't expect much since it's free, but I was incredibly surprised! The game is great fun if you find someone to play it with, and it doesn't matter that you everyone doesn't have a headset! This idea is simply brilliant, I have never tried a game done so well for FREE. Of course maybe it has some flaws, like that a level may not last long and you have to play a little to become good, but you can't ask for everything. I hope they add new content soon, I would also be willing to pay for it if necessary, but I really want this game to grow. Definitely worth a try."
