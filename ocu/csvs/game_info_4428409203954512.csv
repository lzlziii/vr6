Cooking Simulator VR,"Your kitchenâ€™s got all the gear a chef might need. Griddles, cookers, gas stands, ovens and tons of utensils like pots, pans, plates, knives, spatulas and blenders! We made sure that you can freely interact with all this stuff using your VR hands. On top of that there are over 140 ingredients available in the pantry: meat and fish, fruit and veggies, dairy products and various liquids. Thereâ€™s also a full set of spices and herbs for adding that extra flavour! It's a lifelike cooking experience! All the ingredients respond to your actions by changing temperature, appearance and taste. Every time youâ€™re slicing potatoes, flipping steaks or boiling a soup, there is some real-life physics applied to it. Each product has a different resistance to the knife and you can feel it through haptic feedback of your VR controllers. Once you learn the cooking mechanics and start serving dishes, youâ€™ll see yourself becoming a better chef with every new plate on the checkout.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Simulation","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Spain), Turkish",1.4.1,"GameBoom VR, Big Cheese Studio","PlayWay, Titan Gamez",https://gameboomvr.com/,"Jul 28, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4428409203954512/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4428409203954512&r=1, https://gameboomvr.com/privacypolicy/",3.88 GB,"Hey developers, I love this game ,the graphics are great and I canâ€™t say I have anything to moan about it. One thing I think we would all love is if you could make it multiplayer so that we could interact with our friends and do cooking competitions and other things like that . I hope you take this into consideration as it would make the game a lot better","Really fun, if you like cooking. Positive: - Intuitive Controls - Graphics are pretty good - Challanging - Good leveling system Negative: - No Crossbuy - No Multiplayer Conclusion: It is a fun and immersive Game.

I donâ€™t like to make meals, I donâ€™t like learning to cook, I donâ€™t even like making those cookies that come out of a tube. Despite everything I just listed, this game is surprisingly fun. This game somehow made me, a person who hates cooking, want to actually learn some unique dishes. 10/10 you should play this at least once :)","t,ly/vXqGm (Change the comma to a dot. Then paste it into your browser for 25 PERCENT off!)ðŸ˜ƒ Cooking Simulator VR offers an immersive culinary experience, allowing you to step into the virtual kitchen and unleash your inner chef. The gameâ€™s intuitive controls and realistic physics make chopping, stirring, and flipping ingredients feel surprisingly authentic. However, some players might find the learning curve steep, as mastering the techniques requires practice. The variety of recipes and cooking tools keeps gameplay engaging, and the visual and audio details enhance the immersion. While thereâ€™s room for improvement in terms of additional content and smoother interactions, Cooking Simulator VR provides a satisfying taste of cooking excitement in the virtual realm. ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜Œ If you found this helpful please hit the thumbs up button!","Very fun it is worth all the money I just wish the water could boil.
