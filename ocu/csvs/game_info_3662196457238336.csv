I have a particular interest in the brain, and I have found that so far, even though it's wonderful I can pick parts of the brain out and turn them around, some bit are missing. For example, there is no substantia nigra pars compacta, you can't break open regions of the thalamus, etc. The level of detail isn't as good as I'd like, even though it is pretty amazing. But I can't identify the smaller areas other than the pituitary, etc. Having said all that it's great for basic anatomy. I'd just love to see a deeper level of detail.",I wanted to sell my oculus but with this app I won’t do it :-) Very realistic and nicely done. A real help in med edu. I’ll purchase it.,"Its a nice app, but lacks some serious features. The human anatomy is way more complicated and detailed then here. Add the features from the App ""Visible Body"" and then we are talking. Ah yes and add german language. Then i would consider a sub for a year for like 40 Euros.",I’m in school and was given this app to help learn anatomy. I even chose the professional license thinking that there would be a more in depth learning experience.. please tell me why there’s no difference between the $30 sub and the $100+ sub? I’m not happy,"I get that it’s still in development, but no one wants to pay a subscription for something like this. It was glitchy for me, so I wouldn’t part with a penny until it’s a complete product. No way will I be paying a subscription, so you’ve already lost one customer. And other reviewers say the same."
