The Drop Off,"The Drop Off is a virtual reality simulation in which players catch capsules into similarly colored canisters. By missing a capsule, or using the incorrect canister, the contents of the capsule are deposited into two tanks with various creatures inside.

Points are calculated at the end of the game based on the number of capsules placed in the correct canisters, which are then safely placed in a deposit box.
