And whenever you feel you‚Äôre ready to come back to developing this game please try and make a Miles Morales power-set with Invisibility and Venom powers To all the people who read this, Please like this post so he will get better and try to make a Miles Morales power-set",Npcs: Bad- Ok- Good- Best- ‚úÖ Out of this world- Physics: Bad- Ok- Good- Best- ‚úÖ Out of this world- Maps: Bad- Ok- Good- Best- Out of this world- ‚úÖ Graphics: Bad- Ok- Good- ‚úÖ Best- Out of this world- Stuff to do: Bad- Ok- Good- Best- Out of this world- ‚úÖ Overall I would give the game a 9.5/10. I love it üòÉ.,"So the game is good itself don‚Äôt get me wrong, but after a while it just gets a little boring especially when it comes to the NPCs, like if it would be possible, there should be mods either in game where it‚Äôs automatic or just people making mods for the game and we have to install them manually, and also for the human regular NPCs, instead of just standing there, they should walk around and if we attack them, then they should try to fight back (even though it would be pointless) but I feel like that would give the game the spark that it craves, because like I said yes, the game is really good, but after a while it gets a little boring.. so I don‚Äôt know if everything that I suggested would be possible to do especially since the Oculus Headset doesn‚Äôt have that much capabilities unless you use a computer.."
