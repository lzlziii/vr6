High Desert Eclipse,"The entire scenic horizon becomes sunrise and sunset during the High Desert Eclipse. From your remote majestic hilltop, see the rapidly encroaching shadow of the Moon turn day into twilight. The heavens and earth had to move to capture and bring you this 360 documentary short film from its unique vantage point! Experience the 2017 great American total solar eclipse like no other, in 4k 360 video. Feature spans through 2 minutes each of pre-, full, and post-totality from its remote location in the Oregon desert. The “once-in-a-lifetime” experience that users at VR events and film festivals love. Brings back fond memories for anyone fortunate enough to have seen a full eclipse in their lifetime and a rare chance to see one for those unable to travel.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","360 Experience (non-game), Documentary & History, Travel",English,1.0.0.35,L.

This is my first VR experience with my own Oculus device (though I've experienced much high-end VR as a professional in the space) , and I appreciated the natural environment and documentation of an eclipse along with the mellow music. I look forward to seeing what's next for this studio.","This was the mystical experience I did NOT have when viewing this eclipse from my yard! I love the setting with all its colors and layers and textures. The music was just right for the journey to penumbra which I have never witnessed like this before, it gave me chills of the best kind. What a powerful example of the potential of 360 video to capture the world in an immersive, inclusive-feeling way. Spectacular camera work and editing. Agreed with the description, it makes me want to do this in person asap. Highly Recommend for All Ages.","Good: it's a neat video of a phenomenon very few people get to see, and conveys a part of that experience effectively. I was lucky enough to view the same eclipse from a spot that couldn't have been too far from this ridge, and recognized the all-around sunset and amazed people milling about that characterized my experience. The soundtrack was nice, and I appreciated the effort to make it spatial as opposed to just stereo. Needs work: There is no field-recorded sound or - of course - any of the physical chill of a full solar eclipse, but good luck getting that in VR! It is just a short 2D, 360 video that would work just as well on YouTube 360. The resolution is not particularly good and the crazy contrast and color of this event is difficult for any camera to replicate. So I wish there was more to the app. Just think how amazing it would be to have a google-earth bird's eye view of the event that you could push and pull back and forth in time and watch the shadow of the sun move across the landscape! Or a mini solar system model showing the sun Earth and moon in alignment! But this is literally just the video. Rating mostly to encourage the developers to keep going.","Having just “missed” the totality by a few miles back in 2017, this was a pretty cool way to finally see it! Yes, it is 2017 technology so not as crisp an image as you would get today, but the immersive sights, sounds and the high desert setting are awesome.","A once-in-a-lifetime experience that can be enjoyed by everyone - great example of why VR is a fantastic communicator. It's also really chilled, relaxing and profound to watch the skies darken and sun disappear into an inky circle in the sky. Viewed on Quest 2."
