Change the radius of the Ai area… what I mean by that’s is allow the ai to move past the blue line like the player can. I’ve had to sit for 2 minutes waiting for the puck to cross the red line so I can strike it. Otherwise good job",To the Devs … did you guys Abandon this project is the best air hockey on VR … it have some minor glitches like when trying to invite people to play the table glitches out and the puck glitches out but overall fantastic realism I hope you guys are still working on it it would be a shame to let this one go￼,"Great graphics. Should be multiplayer, and sold in the real quest store after that is done. Also add YouTube for music.","This felt exactly like air hockey. Well done. Had to walk into the table slightly to reach the puck but that was no problem as still behind the goal There are speakers in the corner of the room but no music playing, this game would be much enhanced by the ability to put some music on. Also couldn't exit had to reset my device to get out","This brought back many happy memories of my youth. Solid hand tracking, realistic game play. A must for Air Hockey fans. Good job Dev looking forward to more updates! Cons: It would be nice to have an option to change the scenery and/ or AI players. A bit more heptic feedback in the controllers. For some reason the AI player isn't themed, it just a solid white character with a headset on. Please fix/update"
