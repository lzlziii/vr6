I like spawning browser windows then “attaching” them to my walls. (Without Guardian, this would be a cool app to turn every room of a house into its own physical website location, too.) HOWEVER, this app has a really annoying glitch which makes it almost unusable. If I wait around ten minutes, most windows break. I mean, they turn completely white (with their address bar and keyboard still visible), but I can't see the webpages anymore, even if I use the address bar to change pages. Even cloning a window doesn't fix the glitch, so I have to exit then open the app again to use the browser for ten more minutes before it happens again. If this wasn't an issue, I would recommend this app, but in its current state, I cannot. This glitch NEEDS to be fixed. (If it helps, i use a Meta Quest 2.) Also, Reality Browser could use more settings. Most are just privacy-related things that I don't care about…","I can't close windows, is there a tutorial, or a button configuration, just goes right into app. Pushing buttons grabs, and opens windows, but how do I close one? What do all my buttons do? Also a shame there is no hand tracking to just type on these keyboards instead on click on every letter",I used it and it was evident that the performance is really slow (compared with Firefox vr and consider that that application had no updates anymore),"As it is easy for us to change the direction of the window, it will be useful if we can change the aspect ratio, or switch between horizon view and vertial view. And the surrouding view is also an essential founction.","This is great, being able to spawn any number of browser screens around you really makes it possible to work and live in the headset. I wish we could resize the window aspects though, a big tall portrait screen would be useful. Drops a star for the issue with windows going white, and only fix is to exit and restart the app. I understand this is quest2 resources, but would be better to have a restart button on each browser, or optionally suspend a browser when you it loses focus. But overall, this is exactly what browsing on a headset should be !"
