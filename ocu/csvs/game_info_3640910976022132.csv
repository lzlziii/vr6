But the interactions, systems, accuracy and overall experience with the app is amazing. You can see that it's been made with passion towards a very realistic VR use case.","This is so well put together for exploring your inner rock star. I can't tell you how much fun it is to see and feel the music you can create. I've got no real musical talent and can't keep a beat. I'm using the tempo switch to fix my timing, and I sound like a legit drummer.. Insane!!! Give some money to this team when they get the full version out so they can take this even further. I've got a few suggestions that may be incredible features to add or maybe not. 1. Saving custom studios with everything setup and with the looper files still, there would be a game changer. It would also be cool to be able to share them. 2. Adding your own sound clips to any of the instruments. I was thinking of short clips from the mic that could enhance a custom experience. 3. After setting up an instrument it would be nice to be able to close the info box down to a tab so you don't accidentally grab the whole thing while your playing. 4. Some way to toggle off the pointer laser. 5. If you get bored and want to experiment with hand tracking to add a more immersive experience, that would be cool ( I know that this probably won't work perfect and may not be worth your time) Please Do Not listen to the people who don't want to be able to layer the drum pads. I love being able to create multiple layers of sound. If they don't want accidental hits they can space them out in anyway they want. Lastly I just want to say Thank you for all your hard work and creative ideas on this. It is incredible and I'm sure it's going to inspire many people to play music.",I'm excited for the official game to come out! There are so many things you can do with this.,Such an awesome vr music world!!! This is the future of music!! I can't wait for new features!,"It singlehandedly gave me the inspiration to go and learn how to create music. It's been almost 8 months now since the beginning of my journey and I still can't get enough. Vitruoso has some great therapeutic qualities for me, as I can just spill out all of my problems into music without feeling like I'm being handicapped by my lack of experience"
