Elven Assassin,"Is there anything more epic than slaying hordes of orcs and dragons with a bow in Virtual Reality? When nothing comes to your mind, then you probably should try this. If you thought: ""Of course, slaying them with my friends online in co-op mode!"" then this is a matter of destiny. BECOME AN ELVEN ASSASSIN. Take a bow and kill hundreds of enemies that want to get into the elven town and destroy it. As an elven assassin, you will make spectacular shots like long-distance headshots. PIECE OF CAKE, THEN? Not really. The Orcs are running fast, they break into houses to hide from your arrows, and when they get furious, their massive axe is thrown to splash your head into pieces. ASSASSIN UNITED. Up to four assassins may unite to defend the town. Communicate using voice chat, but watch your language.

More than 4 players in a co-op game. Ideally 6-10 on larger boards. Yes, we have up to ten people who really want to play together. 2. A fix for re-centering your character. Last update before the new PvP map found this to no longer be an option. People are getting stuck next to walls and injuring themselves. More boards :-) We love this game and want other friends to join.",It's another archery game. It's got a fun tower defense mode to it as well as a different selection of levels. It's fun to meet people but all the gameplay consists of is shooting your bow over and over and over again. Gets real repetitive real fast and the novelty only lasts for about an hour,Me personally I love archery so this was a great game to play and I love this game but my only criticism about it is the bow placement it is so crooked and not where my hand is in real life at all so that messes me up a bit but other than that I love this ga.e,I like the game play and the multi-player is cool. The graphics are smooth and there are lots of level ups. But I have fun just shooting arrows at orcs.,I thought that this would be a great game for me but then I changed my mind after I saw this game but this is great for people that like td/tower defense games this is not for me the graphics are good and gameplay to but I do not like it in my opinion and wanted to refund it but when I got this game I did not know how to do refunds ï¿¼over all 4/10 for me
