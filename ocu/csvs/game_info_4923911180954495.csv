Once Upon a Sea - Shimon Shukron - The Last Man Standing,"For 50 years, Shimon Shukron worked as a beach ranger at Ein Gedi Beach and lived in a hut at the foot of the sea. Following the appearance of a huge sinkhole and the closure of the busy Route 90, the beach was also closed, and overnight Shimon's home became a ghost area.
