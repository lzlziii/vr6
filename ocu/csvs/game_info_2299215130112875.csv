You don’t really engage in fights, there can’t be strategy as it’s too busy all the time and you end up just randomly sliding around with the swords in your hands, which makes you almost invincible and all the other weapons and stuff useless.","I have played the HTC Vive version before and I can definitely say it’s very different. The fun is still there, but a few options I liked are not. I miss big hand mode and the original maps (lab, cemetery, the one similar to warehouse, and all of the room clearing maps). If only those were added. Now, onto what I like about the Untethered version. 1. New enemies 2. New weapons 3. No tethers 4. Graphics look decent (like htc vive) 5. I can still have fun 6. I can do a flip Yeah that’s about it. Fun game, great company, go purchase it. Also, I would gladly pay for a DLC of the original Sairento maps.","25 🪙💰🪙💰🪙💰 % off ⬇️ ricardoaos.bio.link The best game, the number one 💪 This game is one of the best virtual reality experiences.

However, it somehow got pretty repetitive and I just drifted away. Maybe multiplayer is where it's at, but I basically found a rifle-sword combination and felt unstoppable. It's a bit underrated which is why I'm going 5 stars."
