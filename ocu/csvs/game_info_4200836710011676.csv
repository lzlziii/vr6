This is my new favorite horror game. Itâ€™s so funny. This game had me laughing so much. It got me twice though for someone who doesnâ€™t scare easily. I love puzzle games and I love horror games. Perfect! Enter if you dare. Not for the weak. ðŸ˜‚,"A Great little horror game I'm impressed as made me jump etc quite a few times which will be the new ""try this game out on my headset guys!"" at the next house party .... Should create a good laugh watching them poo themselves..","Not bad, but it has some illogical puzzles, the menu can only be interacted with the right hand, the doors interactions could be improved. As a PC game it would be fine, but needs more polishing for VR controls.",Cursed night well it made me curse a few times so can only play when no kids about but I play seated and now I'm stuck as I can't pick 1 item up so will have to start again and play standing but dare I go back in the house if you're after the scariest game then this is it and at this price. Message for development I started game again this time standing I was too tall any chance you could add seated mode cause for some strange reason I want back in that house
