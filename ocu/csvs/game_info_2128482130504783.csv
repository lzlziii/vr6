Dreadhalls,"Experience a new kind of immersive horror in Dreadhalls! You are trapped deep inside a massive dungeon. Explore it, survive it, and find a way to escape. Your only weapons will be stealth, your own courage, and a faint light. Inspired by the survival horror and roguelike genres, Dreadhalls has been terrorizing people ever since its debut at the 2013 Oculus + Indiecade VR Jam. Dreadhalls is an intense and scary experience, not for the faint of heart.

Out of all the horror games to play, this one is definitely ðŸ‘Œ ðŸ’¯. -Atmosphere fantastic -graphics needs work -But you can keep replaying it since the maps always change, very nice touch. -The creatures are great, and the fact you have to survive and cannot defend yourself is terrifying. - When you watch videos your like"" that s#!% is not scarry"", then you put the head set on, and it's like ""f@*& this is scary s#!%"".","Don't get me wrong, this is a great game. However, it hasn't aged very well. The controls are VERY different to your average VR title. The jump scares are cheesey and there isn't much content to this game. However there are rather tense moments when you're being chased and run out of stamina. All and all, this is an ancient horror game that I would probably play for 2 hours, get bored, then play for 5 minutes and get bored again.","This is great, cheap and a great experience!!! In my first game I had to take off the glasses, it was scary! :-) Highly recommended. Please developers keep it updated! Thanks!",My pants are wet â€” 10/10,"I like the concept of the game but it does have its downfalls. Starting off with the good stuff: - I love exploring the levels, looking at the map to make my next decision and holding the lantern which cools down after a while (and needs topping up) - Some of the rooms are well designed - The creatures are scary - There are some good jump scares - I love that each enemy has its own strength and weakness - The concept of the game is interesting - I love getting lost in a scary place Now for the bad: - When you die, the game tells you how to get past each of the enemy (come on atleast give me a chance to work it out)! It's supposed to be a scary game, I don't want my hand held! - The faces don't have enough to say, and mostly say the same thing (waste of coins collected) - There are points in the game I started to get a bit bored - Make the game longer, I was devasted that I completed it in around 2 hrs (telling players how to get past the enemy doesn't help!) - The graphics aren't great (but expected for the game price) - not enough interaction with surrounding objects - some rooms have just been made for the sake of extending the game, put more attention / effort into them. Every room should be unique."
