INVOIDERS Galactic Defender,"Year 4527, humanity conquered the stars. The science allowed us to exploit the mysterious black matter also known as the VOID. Thanks to this energy, man developed inter-dimensional portals, weapons, spaceships, holocoms, even vacuums ! Unfortunately this energy overexploited by our industry shows signs of instability lately. The portals seem to operate on their own without request. Shadows are coming out the VOID… The Invoiders. You are an intergalactic prisoner sent to the front line on the battlefield to push them back. Let’s say that it’s your way of paying off your debt. Good luck… ---------------------- Grab your weapons and defend the colonies from the invoiders. Buy Turrets and upgrade them ! Show your skills with different type of weapons ! It's your strategy against the invoiders. Can you defeat all them ?",7+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Shooting, Strategy",English,3,AIKO STUDIOS,Aiko Creative Studio,https://invoiders.com/,"May 25, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3807370422692379/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3807370422692379&r=1, https://aiko-creative.fr/permalink-uid/page-8",1.84 GB,!,When I first got this game hopes were high but some key aspects in a TD game are important to me. 1. The game had good graphics and has cool gameplay but I think of this as an all skill game. You may think a tower defense game should have a sense of progression but the only upgrades available are the towers in game and the weapon skins that do nothing and are purely cosmetic. 2. New enemies are important to get a challenge but the devs just took the easy way out and keep putting more of the same enemies and making them stronger no variation of costumes or anything just the same enemies. 3. The devs are always important and I looked around and haven’t found any sign of activity from them. They have not updated the game as well as responded to a review. It makes me think that they are currently working on another project. Overall has potential but think before buying.,"Invoiders is quite fun, and I like the graphics. It has such a clean sci-fi look to it. The ""den"" area where you explore before you enter the mission is also really beautifully done, with lots of details ... to look at. This isn't like Vacation Simulator where you can touch everything. But there's lots to see, and the black hole through the window is gorgeous. The actual game is very enjoyable for a quick pick-up and play game, but that's because I love tower defense games. I also really enjoy helping out by teleporting all over the map and shooting the enemies. It's quite satisfying and it's nice you can upgrade the towers but to this day I can't figure out what the different ""types"" are supposed to be. Overall I enjoy the game, and though it's rather limited, it's beautiful to look at and the gameplay is fun. Sometimes that's enough.","Wow. I just spend the last 30 mins playing this game! I saw this on Side Quest but I was even more happy to see it was on App Lab which made downloading and getting updates easier. First, the graphics of this game is PHENOMENAL! The game play reminds me of Elevn Assassin but better. I got that games months go and ended up returning it. I'm still getting used to shooting the arrow but I saw in the trailer being able to fly and shoot? Where does that happen. How can I do that? Also, will this be multiplayer???? It has to be. That would make this game even better. I spend the last 30 mins playing by myself and failed two rounds. I know there's the upgrades and those are cool. But it would still be nice having someone else to play with. A few tweaks the little creatures make these weird screaming noises. I wish I could have turned it down or off. After awhile it was starting to get annoying! Also, when pointing things on the menu I had to hold me hand/controller at a weird angle to click what I wanted. At certain parts my arrow also seemed a bit off. Besides that, this game seems like it has a lot of promise. I'm looking forward to updates and this game getting better! Update. After playing more. Still love the game. Another addition that would be cool would be to have mini missions of some sort. That would add to the challenge of the game like you get stars if you kill a certain amount of creatures and that can go towards getting more upgrades.",Impressions Video with Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9CA-st64Ok My Initial Impressions: A surprisingly good Tower Defense game in VR with crashland style vibes.
