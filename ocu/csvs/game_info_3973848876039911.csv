How many floors you dominate, more close you going to be a King Of Hell You need to use hand movements to cast magic, your abilities and memory define casting speed and your success. This is not easy! But I believe in your abilities!",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Adventure, Horror",English,0.1.3.3,Mimic.Land,Mimic.Land,https://mimic.land/,"Jul 16, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3973848876039911/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3973848876039911&r=1, https://mimic.land/king-of-hell-privacy-policy/",444.3 MB,"There is a book that tells you how to do things like cast spells and place towers. But it could do with a playable tutorial the book could tell you how to start the level. But other than that great game. ---------------------------------------------------- Now let's talk about glitches I found when I use controllers the hands are weird. ---------------------------------------------------- Overall, the game is pretty good 5/5 I would like to see more updates. ---------------------------------------------------- I would pay 5 maybe 10 bucks if the bugs were fixed. Update added tutorial.","I have been looking for a game with magic and hand tracking for a long time. This looks cool, sadly I do not know how to do anything because the gestures are very wanky and there is no tutorial. I understand this is just a prototype and am excited for some updates update: tutorial has been added, now I know how to play the actual game. The gestures work well and learning how to cast the spells is fun. For 1$ I totally recommend the game.",Personally I think this game is garbage I understand making games for vr is difficult but câ€™mon you guys are gamers yourself get it together.,"The preview video of this game looks fun. It seems to be some kind of tower defense game. I've been able to construct some towers and teleport, but it's difficult to figure out the controls or to do anything consistently. It's a work in progress, so I'm happy to see where it goes.","Looks fantastic, I also need some kind of tutorial. Excited to see this app come to life."
