Here they are : - I had lot of trouble with icecream. Difficult to pick it, sometimes it restart, lot of time lost and Im still not sure of how to do to avoid this difficulties - people are complaining it takes too much time though I'm waiting for the machine to do the job and didn't loose any time ?? - everything is far, I have to teleport for every single thing - color of caramel and chocolate are not always so clear (besides the picture of what they want and what they finally get are not same) - when I cut things, there are always parts falling on the floor... Because of all this things, I hesitate to buy it Not sure the definitive version has resolve all this ? ================================== Pour échanger vos expériences et vos avis: 👉 metaquest*forumactif*com 👈 Pour les promos quest : 👉 webnetka*com 👈",The game is good I like it it feels like you are cooking,This is a fun game I will buy the full game,The game is really good Even my mother Loves this Game The demo is really fun to play please make it to clean tables Add delivery car's
