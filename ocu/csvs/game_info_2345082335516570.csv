Acron: Attack of the Squirrels!,"WARNING: This is a highly addictive VR game and must be played with at least one other person who joins the game on a mobile device. The required mobile game for iOS and Android is free. The golden acorns are under attack! It‚Äôs up to you and your friends to protect them or steal them - depending if you take on the role of an extraordinarily protective tree or as one of several crafty yet thieving squirrels - in the hit cross-platform party game, Acron: Attack of the Squirrels!, from Resolution Games. A game that‚Äôs at its best when played as a couch party game together with a group of friends, Acron: Attack of the Squirrels! is both competitive and cooperative in nature for players across VR and mobile devices. In this hilariously fun experience, one player in VR takes on the role of a large, ancient tree that is the sole protector of the golden acorns. Meanwhile, one to eight frenemies can then grab their iOS and Android devices to become rebel squirrels - who can be customized with 12 unique skins! - that'll do anything to steal the golden acorns using an arsenal of unique abilities across eight different maps.",7+,Multiplayer,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Social","English, English (US), English (Australia), English (Canada), English (South Africa), English (UK), Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Taiwan), French (Belgium), French (Canada), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Venezuela)",1.16.217110-release,Resolution Games,Resolution Games,https://www.resolutiongames.com/acron,"Aug 29, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2345082335516570/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2345082335516570&r=1, https://www.resolutiongames.com/privacy",Terms of Service,281.5 MB,"Bought for work lunchtime fun and has brought exactly that! Brought out a very competitive side of some of the people. The squirrels have gotten very good after playing a few rounds which has caused most of the games to go the squirrels way. Suggestions 1. Acorns should return to the tree faster 2. Homing weapon to pin point squirrels further back 3. Better warning system if an acorn has been picked up 4. Goop should be stickier With these changes, we feel the Tree would stand a better chance!",This is genuinely a great game. I love the characters and the maps. Easily the best party game on quest.

You can play single player against AI controlled squirrels, but the real fun begins when you play with friends. An awesome part is that your friends don't even need to be in the same house as you! Heck, you can find strangers online to play if you want! In-person is best though. I don't know why they spelled acorns wrong for the title. It never explains!
