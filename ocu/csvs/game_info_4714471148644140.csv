Great game, doesn't have Demeo's multiplayer killer feature but the story is good. As many others have pointed out, the hand tracking is annoying but you can play it with controllers as well, so no big deal. It does insist that you use hand tracking when you first start it but never again.","5 stars for game design, 1 star for requiring hand tracking to be on to launch the game. (Hand tracking in-game is not actually required.)","So I LOVE Demeo, but I‚Äôm not too social online, and I get kicked out a million times when trying to join people‚Äôs games. This game is just for a single player, following a full campaign and it‚Äôs done so well!!! The attic where you play is super cozy and has a window in front of you that is scratched and dirty but is clear enough to show you a comforting golden hour orange above a forest. I can‚Äôt get enough of that. It‚Äôs ridiculously comforting to me and the game gets a star just for that!! The board game in front of you is interactive in such a way that it literally builds up in front of you as it changes the scenery and moves across oceans. Of course like in Demeo there are cards and all is turn based. The graphics are mediocre and more grainy than other games, but like other great games the graphics aren‚Äôt the most important thing. You have a mechanical looking bird guiding you and narrating the adventure with different voices. It‚Äôs so good. The lady that‚Äôs doing the voiceover is fantastic and I wish she could tell me a bedtime story every night. I absolutely love this game, but heads up that the first real level you play is too challenging for being one of the first ones. Especially since the levels after are much easier.

And being solo player a nice game to chill too. Although a multi player turn based story driven game will have all the dnd people excited. Good job. No fancy write ups. It's a good fun game. Story driven simple combat and skill checks. If you looking for a dnd style table top game get this. It dosent take long to finish but you can do things differently the next time you play it. It's literally dnd without rolling the dice constantly. You power up your ""scoundrels"" and go. There's a few choices along the way too (I'm not sure if it changes the story to much I'll find out soon on the 2nd play through. Have fun. Thank you.","I wasn't sure if I'd like this type of game as it's so different from everything I normally play...but the reviews were so good and I love a story based game. So I took a chance and OMG I am sooooo glad I did. This game is absolutely delightful. I love everything about it...except for the dice rolling because I keep rolling blanks and ones, lol. I haven't enjoyed a Quest 2 game like this in ages. I actually ran down my battery and had to plug the headset in to keep playing, which I don't normally do. I became very attached to my little gang of ruffians and love the bird too. The ship and the ocean and the ports are adorable and it kind of reminds me of the popup books I loved as a kid, except so much more. I had to force myself to stop playing after almost 3 hours because the back of my head hurt from the headset strap. If it weren't for that, I'd still be playing, lol. Thank you dev's for such a wonderful game!"
