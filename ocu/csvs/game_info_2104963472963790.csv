Fire your bullets in time to the beat of dozens of songs and ‚Äúpistol whip‚Äù enemies in close proximity. In addition, various options can be specified, so you can enjoy the same song in various ways. This game is quite old, but it is still constantly being updated. It's really good that users who have purchased it once can enjoy the newly updated content every time. Because they update for free without paying DLC even once. Was this helpful?

The next day my legs and glutes were screaming and I wondered what happened happened, and I remembered all the dodging and squats I had done the night before. Surprise! You just did a workout while shooting 1000 bad guys last night! üòÇü§£üòÇ Totally great game and the music is awesome.","Wow. What is happening to my ""older"" body? Playing this game for a week, two hours a day and not realising I have lost 7 pounds! And I am having so much fun! Love the music, love the fact you can modify the game for us older folks that do not want to die at the first head shot. I keep playing until I realise it's been 2 hours and I am covered in sweat. I BEG the developers to please keep adding more. I am more than willing to pay for any extras. I can work out at home and feel so darn good about myself. Even my mood has changed at work knowing I have this game coming up when I get home. Freaking LOVE IT! UPDATE: A few weeks playing now. Well I can hardly move my legs after dodging bullets all night. I have challenged myself for ""hard"" mode and boy oh boy, you will feel it the next day. I keep losing weight BUT my calves feel tighter. I sleep better at night after a 2 hour workout. I did have to take a hot bath the other night, didnt realise I had 212 minutes played. Gosh I am addicted to this game! I check every single day, sometimes more than 5 times to see if there is a new update.","I‚Äôm 43. I never could have cared less about video games. People sitting on the couch, when they could have been living their lives with friends. I got this headset as a gift. I got this pistol whip. Ho-Lee f$&k Unbelievable The music tracks are hot and re-listenable The game play with all these options . So, so fun It‚Äôs so fun, so energetic. So re-playable. This IS what I‚Äôd been waiting for as a time killer. But didn‚Äôt know it. 5 stars all the way around. I babbled on like a teenager to the guys at work like a gossip queen. A couple fellas picked it up and none of us can get over the fun factor. Young, old , whatever , get it. If you don‚Äôt find this as fun as it gets in your own living room, I want YOUR living room. Download the future.","At first I was put off by the moving floor, thought it would be an issue, since I'm prone to motion sickness.. but nah. The game's so much fun. Like, ridiculously good fun. Great selection of tunes Unique looking levels Unique styling Such a good workout Nice mix of levels and level types (e.g. 2 pistols, sci fi guns) Really easy to dial in a difficulty setting that suits you. Just feels great to play."
