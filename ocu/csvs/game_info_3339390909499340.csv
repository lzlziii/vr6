Modulia Studio,Modulia Studio is a VR MIDI controller. It allows you to wirelessly control any MIDI-compatible software and has an especially deep integration with Ableton Live™ 10 & 11. It also features a standalone mode with embedded sounds. Build your custom studio using the 11 different modules: - Session (controls the session view of Live™) - Circular Keyboard (a beautiful 360° keyboard) - Scale Keyboard (a versatile scaled keyboard) - Expressive Keyboard (a MIDI-MPE keyboard for expressive performances) - Remote (remotely triggers multiple notes and visual effects at once) - Pads (a 4x4 pads grid) - Cube Mixer (a 3D mixing space) - Cylinder Mixer (a cylindrical 3D mixing space) - Knobs (4 configurable knobs) - Sliders (4 configurable sliders) - FX (visual effects) Download Modulia Desktop for MacOS and Windows to connect Modulia Studio to your MIDI software: www.modulia-studio.com/get-modulia-studio/#desktop ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Ableton® and Live™ are trademarks of Ableton AG.,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,Creativity & Design,English,1.0.5,Thérémix Tech,Thérémix Tech,https://www.modulia-studio.com/,"Jun 14, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3339390909499340/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3339390909499340&r=1, https://www.modulia-studio.com/privacy-policy/",1.40 GB,"After buying and exploring Modulia Studio, and trying to get it to function with Ableton Live Light for an extended time with a technician, the program would Not work as I expected; except I can use the Standalone and Midi functions but Not able to record or create tracks. You should have better luck if you purchase the additional Ableton Live which is 100$+.","This is an awesome concept and although its not perfect I found it to be useful too for music production and mixing. I have studio monitors so using the headset monitor would be useless and wouldn't help with the imaging so i hope the developers just keep making it more practical. Personally, I would like to see the ability to use hands versus the controller so chords can be played. and the ability to mask out qwerty keyboard and even a computer monitor so going back and forth with the daw is more practical. Overall, i think its super cool.",This app is so cool! It is missing passthrough and hand tracking. When that is implemented it will get 5 stars. It could also be so nice with multiuser and co-location multiuser.,"Do not buy if you want audio in your headset. I was having problems getting audio to work in the headset while connected to Ableton Live or other DAW. After multiple emails with Modulia Studio they informed me that audio can not be sent to the headset. You must use your studio monitors, or headphones connected to your computer. Using Modulia studio without a DAW is boring and no recording or loop options . It was a waist of time and money. If the devs figure out how to support the vr headset speakers I may try again. To bad I was exited to start mixing and recording in VR."
