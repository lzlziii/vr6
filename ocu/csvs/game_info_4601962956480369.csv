Thanks",I liked the game and the play and all of it. But the producers wanted me to pay for more multiplayer time. I was really enjoying playing with the kids on this game but because the producers wanted me to pay for multiplayer I thought it was ridiculous. TLDR I enjoy the game but I don't want to pay for it.,"Doesn't load past initial screen with game logo. Reinstalled, restarted headset and still the same result. Figured it's because full version was already released and this one was maybe deactivated. Then why would it still be available for download? Also i saw a review from 1 day ago, so apparently it's working for some. Wanted to check this version to see if i wanna buy full game, but i guess that's not gonna happen.",how do i get the full version to work,"I have a crap internet connection. Not the developer's fault or problem. Like most of my game selections, I selected this, in part, because the description says ""Internet connection not required"" BUT, the game will not load because it ""Failed to connect to server!"", check your internet connection and try again. Misrepresenting the product is the developer's fault, and if they have a problem with this one star review, too bad. This game ""Failed to connect with player."""
