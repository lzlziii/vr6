Agent Simulation Demo,"Agent Simulation is an action, simulation, and strategy game in which each player shows their targeting skills and agility against enemies in a virtual environment. At the end of each mission, you will collect medals and earn various certificates with these medals. At the end of the game, these certificates will prove your strength as an agent and help you to receive your agent license. In each level of the ‘Agent Simulation’, you will be evaluated according to your targeting skills. Before the limited time provided ends, you must kill all your enemies. Every successful head shot will get you more points! Sometimes you will be asked to complete the missions in such a limited time, you have to be fast and agile! There will be three options offered in each level and those options will constantly change! For example, double bullets, double damage, slowing time down, blocking bullets or extra life, etc. You can strategize using any of these options! Fight to be the best!",16+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Shooter, Strategy",English,1.18,Studio Gamebit,Studio Gamebit,http://studiogamebit.com/,"Aug 26, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4386944648041964/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4386944648041964&r=1, http://studiogamebit.com/privacy-policy/",176.3 MB,"Secret Agent Training, that continually gets harder as you go up in assignments. The thing that makes this game different from other first-person shooters is that YOU have to physically move around inside your guardian to avoid the bullets being shot at you! I really have enjoyed this game for over a year, it would be great to see a finished version to buy. I read the poor ratings given, most were from a year or more ago and seemed like they were just little children who aren't very good at playing games and whined about it in their ratings. Ignore the ignorant.","This is pure gold. Please don’t change anything, just add more levels. It’s genius, I feel like james bond. The replayability is incredible, the difficulty’s and the different ways to play levels. It does NOT get boring, I spend hours replaying this game. I also love the AI face telling you stuff, it’s not too much, but it’s also not so little you don’t get it. Perfectly done Can’t wait for the full game.",This is quite hard and demanding game when the enemy shot u you got to move out of the way in real world lol please be careful!! The want to do a forward roll to evade your enemy’s bullets is hard to resist so maybe play in your garden at night? I have uploaded my first experience to you tube ( my channel) can not wait for release of this and will buy in good work. Would like to see multiplayer and Thumb stick movement or real layout movements option and what else u devs can do … good work out application.,"If your looking for a game to play after super hot this is it, it's like playing the matrix film the best part is falling down a skyscraper with agents jumping off the building trying to kill you, plus the slow motion is brilliant. FULL GAME PLEASE! Did I say this is FREE!","Honestly it was really enjoyable I loved every second of it , but I broke my back at the matrix mission haha . I'm Really looking forward to the full game."
