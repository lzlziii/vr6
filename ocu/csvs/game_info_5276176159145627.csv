Suggestions, can we have the pass through function in the gameplay if possible, able to see the floor surface of the court while playing the game, because able to see the real floor surface while you are running after the ball is much better safety to play in this type of recket game in VR if possible. Check out these games first person vr tennis , court time tennis, and badminton battle, all allowed pass through game play to see the floor surface of the court. ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüôèüôèüôè Please build the pass through options into this great game if possible. Yes, I do recommend this game for everyone to enjoy. Thank you.",I want to like it more but it simple rules of pickleball are not observed such as a serve hitting in the kitchen area not marked as out. When playing with robots they may hit on the same side it's kind of disconcerting. I do like the practice areas. Just wish there was some more types.,"There are a lot of of bugs being worked out but it‚Äôs still pretty cool. Things I like: being able to play pickleball with people from all over in the comfort of my own home. Knowing that I‚Äôm supporting new app development with a sport that I love. Join the discord group to find matches- I understand that sometimes they even do tournaments with real prizes. Things that need a lot of work: Ball physics, offline play, being able to do a live match with others online without friending and with ease, the fact that your partner AI is always a worse player than those opposing you are all frustrating at times. I‚Äôve hit the ball super hard to have it not cross the net at times and others a small hit sends it soaring. Also, needs to have height adjustment feature working with the accessibility options on the oculus for wheelchair and seated play for those with disabilities. But, they are aware and working on all those things. I look forward to seeing this game grow.","Playin Pickleball is amazing! If you like pickleball at all, you'll love this game. You can: * Play singles vs an AI bot or a real person * Play doubles with AI bots, real people, or a combination * Practice serving * Hit against a ball machine * Watch and cheer on your friends love matches Control: * Auto-teleport - the game positions you close to take the hit * Auto-Run - similar to auto teleport except movement is more natural and gradual * Manual Run - use your controller joystick or manually walk/run around the court. Paddles: * Variation of paddle shapes to select * Currently two Gearbox paddles to choose from I recommend joining the game's discord channel. There is an active and daily play group that coordinates playing. You can randomly find people online as well. Do not use the single or ranked matchmaking yet, the player base is still growing and not ready for it. Come join us and it will be. Again, if you're a pickleball fan, you will not regret this purchase. I was the gold medalist in the singles tournament sponsored by Gearbox Pickleball! This game dev and Gearbox flew me to California to watch the Newport Beach Doubles Shootout in April 2023. Both Playin Games and Gearbox were incredible throughout the whole process and I'm grateful for the tournament. It was truly an incredible experience. Get this game. Buy a Gearbox paddle. Have some fun!","I've been playing real life Pickleball for the past two years, and it's been a great way for me to stay active and have fun with friends of all ages, including my parents who are seniors. Playin Pickleball is a game that captures the essence of the sport and its wonderful community. As someone who plays at a 3.5 level in real life, I've tried all the different VR pickleball games available, and I can say with confidence that Playin Pickleball is the best one out there. It's well-designed and user-friendly, with multiplayer, single-player, and practice modes, as well as a nice big interface for configuring your options. Even my dad, who is a self-described technophobe, became comfortable with the game quickly and now plays with his friends all the time. One of the things that really sets Playin Pickleball apart is the amazing community on Discord. They have daily drop-ins organized by other players, tournaments for all skills levels, and friendly people who have become my friends through my interactions with them. It's a great place to connect with other players and get tips on how to improve your game. Overall, Playin Pickleball is an excellent VR pickleball game that I highly recommend to anyone who loves the sport or wants to give it a try. It's the perfect way to enjoy Pickleball from the comfort of your own home."
