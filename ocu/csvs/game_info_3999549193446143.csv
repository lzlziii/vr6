District M,"District M is a VR skater that combines the addictive loop of a rhythm VR game with the madness of a 3rd-person platformer in a stylized festive world. Our first demo of 2 levels got a lot of love so here’s a new one with 8 test levels that you’ll love even more. The game is in development and will launch with 30 levels of increasing difficulty, multiplayer mayhem, gesture-based tricks, magical environments and so much more. If you have any feedback/suggestions or face any issue, please ping us on Discord. We really want to build a great game and we can’t do it without your support. Do join our discord to meet other players, our devs and playtest more of the game till we roll out.

Very excited for the full release Most original game on the quest, there's elements of olli olli 2 and subway surfers here but there's nothing else like it on quest. This is going to be a beautiful game to escape into. Wonder if they'll add in tricks?","BGM is top notch,Graphics are funky & modern. Yes it is too short for now but hope developers will add more levels as it is just the beginning. Gameplay if you wanna see how it looks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3hNt_hz9Cw",District M is a sweet new rhythm game that is has some cool beats to groove to. You get to control a rollerblade character while keeping sync with the music! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmrP0jrfAPw,"The controls don't move your character enough to the side, not very intuitive. One handed mode made it playable. You can jump from easy level tracks to the hard mode tracks and the camera will follow you down, allowing you to complete hard mode tracks. Easy and hard level difficulties should be separated more clearly, preventing this.","I think the music tracks in this game are great, and the levels that accompany them make it even better! I definitely recommend you try out this game for yourself."
