It's cute and fun. I love looking for the hidden items in each scene. BUT... It does have several bugs/glitches that need fixed. I've had to restart scene 10 five times and just shut out of it knowing I had to restart it again. Please please look into scene 10. Usually glitches a big, but I can restart once and do it again just fine, but not with this one. The magnet keeps getting stuck in the ground where you can't get it pulled up even with making it respawn. The ghost sheet disappeared from my hand once and the truck was gone so never respawned (2nd time it did respawn on the magnet). Then just now when I shut it off, the wind up knob on the back of the piano was glitches and was several feet behind the piano. Tried making it work glitches out, but wouldn't. I tried throwing the piano many times but always respawned still buggy. Please fix this. The game has great potential, just needs a bit of fixing. Thank you.",Put oculus address first /Perrtti/2366136696841248,"To begin simply, I had downloaded this game because I felt like it would feel cozy and warm, I definitely wasn’t disappointed with my choice. I felt like a little kid trying to solve puzzles while talking to Louis and sometimes just bumping his tiny fist <3 The music, graphics were amazing and overall story just made me cry so hard at the end. It took me days to finish the game because I wanted to fully enjoy this beautiful game. SPOILER, I also related to Louis’s story because I was once a kid who had a sick mom just like he did, and it healed my inner child knowing that Louis could have a happy ending with his mom :,) I wish I could have had a good ending with my mom just like Louis did.. Definitely some good tears at the end but it was worth it, I am proud of you Louis! And thank you for all developers and everyone who had made this game for the emotional yet beautiful journey :,)","An adorable game with a beautiful, unique art style.","I enjoyed the game and the tasks. The environment, atmosphere, music, characters are all great. You can interact with many things. Well designed game. It's worth buying on sale."
