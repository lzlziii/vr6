Unfortunate it's not documented where they supposed to go. The directory is root level called ue4game. Songs directory is under that. Once you figure that out the gameplay is brilliant but it's plagued by neglect and is barely supported so there are small problems like being inside the floor when you start the game. Nothing game breaking though The last update fixed most of the biggest problems.,Can I ask what is the problem I downloaded demo version of this fab game but then last night I decided to buy the game its self but it Start the game up what csn I do Other than that it's a fab game when I can get it going,"Help, my app still works not correctly. How can i understand that app is updated to 065 version???...upd. Sorry, I found trouble. I made AV Sync with ""+"". When it ""-"" minus it is good, but what setting is best???","The free play mode sounds and plays great and got my hopes up, but when I actually tried to play a song in arcade mode, it all fell apart. Hitting drums often makes no sound at all, the game just lowers the song's volume anytime you miss a note. This creates a very fake and unsatisfying feeling. I don't want to just play pretend air drums to a fixed track. I hope the Devs change arcade mode to work like free play, so you hear every beat, even if it's the wrong drum or timed wrong, because free play shows this game has potential to be very good. But for me this game is unplayable in its current state and not at all enjoyable.","The bugs listed below existed since day 1 of d/ling this game, but I chose to give it some time since its a sidequest app. Now I just think its unfair to charge money for an app that's not even being maintained. I'd understand if these were rare/complicated bugs, but these are COMMON/GAME-BREAKING bugs that doesnt seem to be getting ANY attention at all Bugs: -The game does not save any scores and recommends the tutorial every single time I open the app as if I am a new player -setting values are not updated dynamically(ex: drumstick tilt does not update until starting a song, then coming back to the menu) -After playing around 3-5 songs, the game has to be restarted because none of the menu items are clickable. This happens every time without fail -The song ""Broken by Ghosts of August"" is bugged. When youre playing correctly, it plays the lower volume track that should playing when you mess up, and plays the louder volume track when you actually mess up or stop playing(opposite of every other song) I do play the drums IRL and honestly think this game actually does have a lot of potential and I am definitely looking forward to what this game becomes. I do understand the bugs fixes and other improvements arent being implemented because the developer(s) might be too busy or preoccupied to work on it, but they should definitely NOT be charging a dime for this game in its current state. As fun as it can be while the game works, you will be left more frustrated than satisfied after playing *Note* There another issue with a song where some hits do not register, even when hit perfectly. I don't remember exactly which song it was at the moment, I just don't want to turn on my quest just to check the song title."
