It’s a fun way to learn but I couldn’t figure out how to get pronunciations to play so it made getting the right pronunciation to move on hard. I also had a problem with how slow the thumbstick turning on smooth turning was. I have almost no nausea issues with turning in vr with thumbsticks but turning in game was unbearable. I play sitting down mainly so this makes playing the game difficult.,I tried the demo and it is fantastic. I can't wait for the whole thing to come out. It can be improved by letting the user slow down a word to hear it better.,"Its pretty much an educational animal crossing in virtual reality! The devs have been nothing short of nice, and the comunity is great. Though i was promised a cat wich has yet to been added. Other than that 10/10","Really excited to see this game grow, VR language learning has a lot of potential. The vibe of the game is really fun and relaxing too!"
