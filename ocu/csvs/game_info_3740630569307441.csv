Use your skill, protect yourself with masks, take the right treatments, confine yourself, avoid super-contaminators etc ...

It's pretty basic, stand in one spot and attempt to irradicate the virus. I like the idea of it taking place in different locations, but needs to have every level be a new location. Not London, on the street, then London in a hospital. More locations are needed. It would be nice to have an avatar body (doctor or nurse) with arms and hands making the moves to destroy the virus. Very repetitive and needs to be a little more difficult as you go on and on.",Video review and gameplay here: https://youtu.be/UyoPWngk38E
