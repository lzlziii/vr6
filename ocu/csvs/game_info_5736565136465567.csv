Air Drums,"Looking for a way to rock out without waking the neighbors? Look no further than Air Drums! This free game drops you into a cool 70s garage in space, with drumsticks attached to your hands and no instructions to hold you back. While the hand tracking may not be perfect for drumming to songs, it's still incredibly fun to smash around and play with for short bursts of time. Plus, our high-quality environment and physics-based drums will make you feel like you're actually in a real garage band. To use the hi hat and kick drum, simply open your hand and trigger the gesture in each hand. And for the ultimate in realism, you can even hold actual drumsticks while you play!",3+,Single User,Hand Tracking,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,Music & Rhythm,English,0.38,Caleb Geizer,LostError Studios,https://calebgeizer.au/,"Apr 19, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5736565136465567/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5736565136465567&r=1, https://jasiah.dev/privacy/",254.6 MB,"This game is really neat and has a lot of potential!

It does need a few tweaks though, which is completely understandable since it’s in early development. I’d recommend making the drums and cymbals a bit less wobbly and more responsive to be more like real drums. You could also space out the drums a bit more so you can still have the same responsiveness but don’t hit drums you don’t want to while playing. It would also be neat if you increased the volume of the drums when they’re hit harder, not a requirement but it would be cool. Other than that, this game is amazing! The atmosphere and design are phenomenal and I can’t wait to see more from this game. Cheers!","ok, i know that instruments in VR will always never be as amazing as actual instruments, let alone the drums but this game is on another level. The hand tracking is really bad and won’t always sound when hit against a drum like the snare for example and yes yes, i know it’s still being developed coz it’s in app lab but still bro…"
