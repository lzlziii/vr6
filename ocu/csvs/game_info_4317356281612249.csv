I read the post about the beta ￼cosmetic on the 1st of June Thursday which is the day I am typing this, and I was kinda mad because I missed it and I was wondering if there is any way I can get this?","This (surprisingly not paid) game was one of the first games I saw, Once seeing the trailer it looked super fun and couldn't wait to try it out. The graphics are phenomenal, and the creativity and the sheer amount of fun I had playing this sadly short demo. If the full game is paid, which it might be, I'll happily purchase it as long as it has an affordable price tag, Some say it’s just another gorilla tag rip-off, the thing is it uses its creative locomotion in the style it should be, a platformer. This is everything I like and I know in my head, this game and the future full version of it will be supernatural and most likely ‘better’ than Gorilla Tag itself. Great job amusing all players. The only downside is its shortness but it’s a demo so good job developers, hope to see you on May 1st 2023. 95/100","I grew up on Mario, Sonic, Crash and many more. Imagine playing Donkey Kong in VR. That is what this game is close to bringing. It is its own thing so I don’t want to give false expectations but the nostalgia is there. This will go down as the best platformer in VR. I don’t play Gorilla Tag because of the squeakers. This will have a full single player experience. This team just raised the bar for VR!!","I played this game back when the beta first came out and I loved it I never played the multiplayer in the beta when it came out cause at the time because I didn’t play the game as much but seeing how far this game came now knowing it’s fully coming out. Not only that but……FOR FREE? But really good job devs u did a great job, can’t wait to see more of what’s next in No More Rainbows.",I love the game its awesome I have the beta but I thought I could play the new version. sadly I can't because I don't have the 20 bucks needed I thought I wouldn't have to purchase it again as a beta player.
