Bite the Bullet,"Bite the Bullet is an virtual reality action/strategy game where YOU command troops alongside them on the battlefield! Build and defense your basecamp, summon units to fight directly from the battlefield, and wipe your opponent from the map! Spawn self-sufficient soldiers, tanks, helicopter gunships and bombers, all from your wrist! Your troops will mercilessly hunt the enemy, but will need reinforcements to triumph! You can even pick up a weapon yourself in a crisis to pitch in! As the number of basecamps you control grow, your choices in what buildings to construct directly influences the type of army you can field! Just don't forget to build defensive turrets, against both ground threats and those from the sky!",12+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Shooter, Strategy",English,0.0.4,CBL Industries,CBL Industries,https://sites.google.com/view/bite-the-bullet/home,"Sep 16, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5357467881033264/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5357467881033264&r=1, https://sites.google.com/view/bite-the-bullet/home",262.8 MB,"I just love this game, its different.ðŸ«¢","The game is a little clunky and buggy but itâ€™s very fun to play, I particularly take issue with the fact that thereâ€™s only teleport movement The units are also somewhat unbalanced, tanks are the Meta for sure as their fairly cheap, deal a lot of damage and take a lot of punishment, they make most other units obsolete. The issue with the tanks could likely be solved by making the cooldown on infantry shorter so you can spawn more of them as they get cut down rapidly Iâ€™d also like to see more unit types and more complex ways to control them as currently they only attack the closest enemy Overall the game is very enjoyable for a free app lab game despite its flaws, and if the devs keep updating it it could be quite fun","This is a very good game,this game has potential for greatness,it could be pvp or npc playing,a cool down period should help get more men on the field, it should have some kind of intel collecting so you can get more cash for equipment,you could also make the layout longer to explore more,the infantry should be allowed to patrol or attack,which would make you more cautious of buying troops just to get shot down,overall this is a gem if it could get better support!"
