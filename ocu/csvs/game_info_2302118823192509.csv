The fact that this game had 0 DLCs and not a second game hurt me. The story was good, long game play, good sounds, mechanics. This game did something that not many can do and it had it all minus the NPCs can be dumb lol but it was so fun. If there was a game exactly like this but on land, same mechanics and all, I‚Äôd love it.",Genuinely a good game. I love the stealth and weapons. And all for a good price. Definitely a buy üëç 25 0/0 off: bit(dot)ly/OculusDisc Replace (dot) with a period Please like the post it really helps!!!,"This game is outstanding with its gameplay and graphics!! It‚Äôs extremely underrated and no one ever talks about it. It feels extremely tactical and I‚Äôd LOVE to see a second one. I 100% recommend this game if you‚Äôre new to quest, or if your highly experienced. I love this game when my headset is low and I can just sit down with my headset plugged in riding a kayak completing stealth missions.","One of the most polished, pretty, full narrative games on the quest. Great stealth and kayaking action! Absolutely worth full price. Or get it 25 prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot and case matters): b i t , l y / P C O p s",This game is phenomenal! It is well balanced and easy to get used to. I love the fact that you play the entire game seated in your stealthy kayak. The NPC‚Äôs are legit. Weapon selection is locked but still elegant.
