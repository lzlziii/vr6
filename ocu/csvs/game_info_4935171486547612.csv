VR Mummy Girl,"A mummy girl who has been asleep deep inside a pyramid for more than 1000 years wakes up. She doesn’t know what era is it is, who she is, or the reason she's there. She keeps walking, trying to find the exit. Swing your arms down to stretch the bandage, grab the gimmick with the bandage and jump.
