ZOSU Castle Morgue Escape,"VR ZOSU Castle Morgue Escape - You awaken in a dark and scary abandoned castle that was being used as morgue. It is dark but fortunately you have a flashlight, you must find your way out through a series of simple puzzles and mechanics. - This is a casual and somewhat spooky escape-room/area type of game - Mostly search and explore with a few cryptic clues to help you along - Casually playing it should not take more than 60 minutes - Escape the castle quickly for a highscore - The last completed round score and highest all time scores are saved - Many mysteries, skeletons, and castle areas await you! - Some events are slightly randomized for replay ability - 3 game modes: 1) standard in the dark with extra visual hints every few minutes 2) hard in the dark with no extra timed hints 3) explore in the light with no puzzles or scoring",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Exploration, Horror, Puzzle",English,1.156,ZOSU,ZOSU Studios LLC,http://www.zosustudios.com/,"Sep 1, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4962461380529381/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4962461380529381&r=1, https://zosustudios.wixsite.com/website/about",Terms of Service,914.2 MB,Graphics are okay. Wander first 2 - 3 rooms pulling levers and never got any further when the levelers I found did nothing. Gave up. Hint system told me to pull them then nothing happened. Bugged. Can’t progress.,This escape game’s graphics were such that it was a bit scary and immersive but there is nothing terrifying in it and overall a unique and interesting puzzle experience once. Very good at the current price as well. Very satisfying once I finally completed and escaped the castle and dungeon,I like horror games. I recommend this app.,Kinda like the mRNA COVID vaccination
