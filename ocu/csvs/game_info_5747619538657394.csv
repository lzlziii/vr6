Airport Ground Handling Simulator VR,"This is an Early Access of a consumer version of the professional VR training software developed by AVIAR and used by the biggest airports and ground handlers to train their ground staff on an everyday basis. And finally, it is available to the public. In this VR simulation, your role is a ground crew member and you will perform different tasks during an aircraft turnaround process at the airport. This is a unique first-hand experience with the highest realism, insane details, and a very serious approach. AVIAR presents the Starter Pack of the first 5 scenarios - each scenario works in training and exam modes. Starter Pack includes the following scenarios: Pre-Arrival Ramp Checks, Aircraft Marshalling, Ground Support Equipment Connections, Aircraft Cargo Doors Operations, and Pre-Departure Checks - all in various weather and lighting conditions with random issues and hazardous events. Many other scenarios will follow soon and will be available to Starter Pack owners. Always wanted to know what is exactly going on around the planes on the ground? Don‚Äôt ask.

Simply copy and paste it into the internet address bar. I get a $5 store credit from you using my link so it's a win for both of us! If you end up using my link thanks a lot! üëçüèª This game is super fun. Well, it isn't really a game. If you are looking for scoreboards, points, and dynamic action this ""game"" is definitely not for you. This ""game"" is for aviation enthusiasts who would like to join the aviation industry in the future. It's very realistic and hard. The graphics are amazing and they made me feel like I was actually standing next to a real airplane. As an aviation enthusiast, I gotta recommend this ""game"" but only if you like airplanes and you are patient. Great ""game""! If this was helpful please press the like üëçüèª button I would really appreciate that :3","As an aviation enthusiast this game is amazing to me. It allows avgeeks like me to get up close to some amazing aircraft. Some things are not as I like but obviously I can't have everything to suit me. Some of the things I would change/add follow in order of how much I would like them in the game: 1) a wider variety of aircraft (I know that there are 100s of aircraft flying the sky but a few more would be nicer) 2) one thing I would change is the the aircraft marshalling, for me I find the fire left engine signal quite hard to achieve so I would give all signals a bit of wiggle room as humans who are not robots or real ground handlers will find it hard to do these signals. 3) different scenarios 4) a full run through from pre arrival checks to departure. But overall I think this game is amazing for avgeeks","I have been waiting a couple years for this game to be properly released but it just lacks content, I wish you have a free mode where you load bags or even all of the scenarios in one to make it really realistic as that would be cool. I feel like now it is a bit of a money grab but other them that I enjoy it. (Game has not been updated for a long time)",Want to save 25 use this link below bio link/z7xnrbhh Remove space and put (.),I‚Äôve work in aviation for years now and this app is the best thus far I can use to show someone some basic things that are done on the daily. Really want to see the push back module be available.
