UNBINARY,"""Strikingly gorgeous VR puzzle game"" - UploadVR Solve the challenges proposed by an artificial intelligence, unlock the 3 robot masks of this reality, and switch between them using your high-tech bracelet. Wear the yellow mask to be strong and able to carry large crates, climb walls and bridges by hanging from your hands, or switch to the green mask if you want to gain privileges and fire lasers at hidden targets to unlock doors, or even, hack the AI system with the purple mask and change the rules of the game, but beware, your job is to make sure this AI is ready to rule the planet and not screw it up. UNBINARY is an excellent game for anyone just starting out in virtual reality or looking to impress someone with its 100% hand-painted cartoon-style graphics. 3 MASKS THAT OFFER DIFFERENT ABILITIES 22 DIFFERENT SCENARIOS IN A DEEP STORY 100% HAND-PAINTED IN VIRTUAL REALITY",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain)",1.1,Ludact,Ludact,https://unbinary.com/,"Feb 17, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4281519998581593/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4281519998581593&r=1, https://unbinary.com/privacy-policy/",1.26 GB,"Don't sleep on this challenging (but not frustrating) puzzler, in an original and colorful world b i t , l y / u n b i n a r y","Just finished the game, and was happy I played it! It has some neat mechanics that build as you go, adding new functions and abilities. I'm not the best at puzzle games, and it took me about 4 hours, but I only needed to look at a walkthrough once to figure out how to advance (and that was only because there was a glitch toward the end where the platform a robot was on didn't stay lowered after I threw the switch in the other room, and I thought it did something else). The interactions with the robots were fun, especially when they gripe at you and shove you backwards if you get too close. The story was all right. I couldn't fault the AI for being the way it was, since it was trained by humans, after all, so understandably could apply a code of morality to what are essentially machines working in a factory. One could argue that by helping the AI in its quest, you are corrupting the machines. I was viewing the situation differently than the AI did: robots doing their jobs until broken, robots rightly rejecting other kinds of robots that were in the wrong area, removing batteries from robots as a neutral mechanical act rather than an act of violence. But it's still interesting to know the AI's point of view in the story. It's funny that it wasn't considered sexual harassment when a robot would become enamored of you and invade your personal space as a stalker XD. I loved the animation style and the music was pretty good. Sometimes I need to turn music off, but this music added to the overall environment. At times, the movement was clunky, like when trying to grab things to climb. It helps to make sure you hear the grab sound before trying to move up. A few times I was worried about not being able to reach things, since, at 5'5"", some distances were a stretch. But not too many problems in the game itself. Anyway, I recommend this unique VR game for a relaxing puzzle with no rush or real danger, even if the AI tries to hurry you along.","This game is really good it’s a must play! I only found once glitch that made the game unplayable and I have no footage on YouTube or anything else… BUT STILL AWESOME! I got the game on the day of his game rating and I really like it! It’s very cool, the funniest part is when your wearing that one mask and the robots just chase you around","This is a great game! But I feel like this story isn’t quite done yet. There are things about this world that hasn’t really been explained, maybe these mysteries will be explained in a sequel or possibly prequel. Who knows? Anyway this is a great game and I hope we get more stuff like this!","A nice and solid puzzle game. The special thing is definitely the graphic style and the story of Unbinary with the AI. I enjoyed the puzzles with the different masks, but they are not particularly challenging. With the different masks, you have different abilities like shooting or climbing. Overall, the game can be played in a relaxed manner, and there is no rush or stress. All in all, it's not outstanding, but it's solid and good with beautiful graphics - I enjoyed the game, it was fun."
