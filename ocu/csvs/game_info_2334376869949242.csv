I got the Oculus Quest as a gift. I e tried a few of the standard golf and ping pong games and even a a couple of shooter games but not really into them, until I ran across this game. In Death: Unchained is a highly immersive experience. It‚Äôs more than just fighting monsters. It‚Äôs beautiful art work, brilliant game design with excellent response to controls and precision aiming. It forces you to think strategies and learn from mistakes. Each time you enter a level, the set up and types of opponents faced, including the set up of the environments changes just enough that it‚Äôs a differ t challenge every time. I‚Äôve found myself going on YouTube channels to learn from others how to improve and get better at strategizing. I absolutely love this game. I only wish it allowed multiple player so I could play with my sons.","I currently own well over 150 Quest games. If you are considering purchasing this (or others on Quest) click on my pic and then ‚Äúchat‚Äù to DM me as I can help with the cost of the game. (See the end of my review for more help). I bought this with good intentions to learn how to play VR with a bow & arrow - I am used to games that use the more efficient, or so I thought, use of a gun! I kept seeing how high the ratings were and thought I would finally give it a try and how happy I am that I did. I play this literally every day. The bow and arrow mechanics are simply superb. This is not a game you learn in an hour ‚Äì you really need to practice - but the rewards are huge. There is a huge community of players, all sorts of help on YouTube to master the techniques and beat the bosses and season challenges that run for a short period of time where everyone tries to be top of the leader board. Once the challenge is complete and the winner gets to proudly see their rankings they clear everyone‚Äôs totals and you battle it out in the next challenge. In addition to the season challenges there is the full ‚Äúrun‚Äù through different areas of the game ‚Äì each area is distinctly different and challenging. Believe me, hearing the thud of a dead on headshot is marvellous. This game is addictive, you constantly want to strive to beat your score and those of your friends. Give it a try and be fully prepared to keep coming back time after time after time! I hope you enjoyed my review ‚Äì considering clicking the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù button! All my links can also be found on l i n k t r . e e / b l i s s 2 1 2 1 (just remove all the spaces).",Probably one of the best games for VR. This game is addictive and will have you wanting to come back to try and work your way up the leaderboards. Just wish my arms didn‚Äôt tire so easily so I could play more üòÇ Love how the bow feels and it‚Äôs so satisfying when you manage a head shot. Buy it now! üñ§,"Bought this awhile ago,have played it a few times , haven't really got into it,as I have so many other games,trying to complete them,one by one,lol. But ,what I have played,is absolutely amazing and the best physics in bow and arrow I used or played on any game,gets pretty intense. Will update more ,once I get started on it. Here's 25 percent Off to help you decide,you won't regret it. Just add the beginning part.. /Greekspartan121/2334376869949242/?utm_source=2 Thank you & enjoy...",This is a game I keep coming back to again and again. I have been playing for almost 2 years and I continue to play this game as others fall by the proverbial wayside. It has engaging combat and enough difference in each level that you will always feel like you are playing a different game. In death unchained is one of the best.
