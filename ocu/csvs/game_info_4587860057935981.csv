Mixed Reality Wild Animal Escape,"Mixed Reality Wild Animal Escape can be played in any type of building including single or multistory! The player must set up their play space using the game's built in features to enhance their experience. We want to give the player creative freedom to create an action game and place props around their environment. Some animals can be summoned in player defined spawn points and other animals appear in completely random locations around your house/play space. IMPORTANT, before playing, make sure you read the instructions on how to set up your play space. Your experience will depend on how well you set up your play space. Please Note, this app is still very experimental. Optimized For Quest 2 (Best Performance) Similar Set Up Tutorial: Search your browser for Hauntify MR Setup Tutorial.

(if u can could you also make the oculus room setup a way to map your home? it would be easyer to do)",Wow - very intense game. I like this as similar to Hauntify. Nice Job!
