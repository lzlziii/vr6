Just my opinion. I Play this game for hours and hours with friends. I mean I don't kno how much realer things can get here folks ... graphics are scary good. If your a real shooter this for you also save some money and go to l i n k t r . ee slash mr12gage330 also check out other games. Just make sure you leave no spaces In the link,"This game is exactly like R6. The only difference is that their is no choice of different operators, which I don't expect to come to, but it would be an amazing aspect of the game. The graphics look amazing. I sometimes forget I'm on the oculas at some point. The players are also very nice. When I was new to the game, they didn't get mad at me when I made a mistake. Instead, they gave me pointers and tips. Overall, this is a 5 star for me.","This game is insane. It is by far the best competitive shooter on the quest. Everything is just perfect, whether that be the gun control, community, maps, and more. This game is perfect. Buy it now. However, there are three huge problems. The first one is the content. This game only has five maps, with one of them being a team death match map only. Also, there is no shop or even in game progression (I do want to note that they are planning on adding this soon). I know that a lot of people see this as a major plus, however I LOVE this game and would love nothing more than to show my love of this game to other players and the devs themselves with my hard earned money. Another huge problem is the servers. This has gotten better with each new update but it is still annoying. The servers can be slow and will shut down and packet loss can still be an issue. If you have below average internet than the slow ping will cause your shots to not count. This isn’t a problem but should still be considered. The last and final problem is the cheating. A lot of cheating can be seen and it does ruin the game somewhat. But, in the end the game just continues to get better and better. Even though this game has some problems, it is still easily the best on the quest. Every part is masterfully designed and you can tell that triangle factory is at the top of their craft. I wish I could talk about every single Praise I have for this game but listing them would be like writing a book. This game is almost perfect and is getting closer to perfection with each and every update. You NEED this game. Also, one last note, the maps are literally endlessly playable and they never get boring… HOW DID YOU GUYS DO THAT!! It makes no sense. But yeah, just get this game.","Best FPS Vr game out there I would highly recommend. But you might be put up against sweats as time goes on you will get better. If someone’s being toxic report them and moderators will moderate this game best game ever good mechanics, graphics, teamwork, and strategies. If you want link text me and say Breachers and I will send you a link only if u trust me tho.","No cap, the best vr shooter rn. I love r6 and I enjoy this even more. Buy if u can its definitely worth it. Not everyone likes the graphics, but I love them. Not too detailed but detailed enough, perfect for holding angles with cover but never op. I use a Protube Vr stock and it works perfectly. Would recommend, worth the money"
