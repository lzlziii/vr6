Out of the Shadows,"Welcome potential assassins! Armed with your weapons you must complete your objectives completely undetected in order to succeed. Sneak, climb, evade your enemy, or kill at your own risk. Use a variety of weapons including daggers, axes, shields and hidden blades to stab, slash and trip up your enemies. Some weapons are provided, others you'll have to find, steal or kill for. Enemy awareness is heightened as the difficulty level rises! Hide the bodies. Out of the Shadows is a stealth based assassin game currently in early access. There are 3 unique maps with various difficulties, each one has it's own challenges and objectives. There are currently 2 modes: Objective (Complete objectives as quickly as possible) and Overkill (Kill everything as quickly as possible). Not a stealth fan? Run, jump & climb around the maps without any reaction from enemies in Sandbox mode!

The stealth is nearly perfect and the physics are definitely above average with minimal jank. This game also has plenty of content and replayability considering the price tag. I believe it took me 4 - 5 hours to beat all 3 levels and I still haven't fully explored the maps. Despite how amazing the game already is, there are some things that I'd like to see changed: 1. Add a maximum capacity to the arrow quiver. The arrow quiver on your right shoulder currently has unlimited arrows which makes speeding through levels way too easy(I didn't realize the quiver existed until the third level and I had previously been picking up one arrow at a time and had way more fun). Once I discovered it I stopped thinking about how to approach an enemy and just straight up killed them without tactically thinking. Maybe even adding durability to the arrows as well where the arrow will break after 2 - 3 uses. I just feel that the bow is way too useful and needs to be limited and used as a last resort to get out of a situation. I think a 3 - 5 arrow cap would work really well. 2. Adding ways to distract the enemies like throwing an object in a certain direction to draw their attention. 3. This change might be kinda a long shot and isn't as important as my other suggestions, but maybe instead of failing the mission as soon as you're spotted, the enemy will try and attack you, and if you get killed, then you fail the mission. Like I said, this is the least realistic change I'd like to see, but even without it, the game is still awesome and deserving of 5 stars.","Game is very good, smooth and has a great selection of enemies. This is by far the best game you want if you are looking for a stealthy/assassin game ðŸ˜Š",This little gem is something I would say alot of people who play Vr have been waiting/asking for. Give time patience and fair reviews to help construct an build towards an amazing Vr game. Keep it up a long way to go so keep on going and don't stop so far it's nailed little things other games miss but yet still a bit o tweaking and work to do. Love it !,Love it so much this game is so fun and makes my dreams come true (not what I mean like i love assassins and all that) but this game rocks,This game is brilliant the way you have to be on your tippy toes at all time is outstanding I love the way you can stab people and hide there body's it's like creed I 100% recommend this game and it's only 5 pound I was gonna gift it to my friends but I have no moneyðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
