Presence,"Imagine a playful, meditative-like space where you can connect with your innermost self. A space where you can lose yourself and find yourself all in the same session. Imagine a series of experiences set in surreal environments that are designed to combine emotions like anticipation, serenity, and amazement and then rewarding you with a flow state filled with feelings of mastery, achievement, immersion and creativity. This is Presence.

This app started off kind of interesting and then five minutes later it was over. Huh? No option to continue on, taking in the minimal sights and sounds? Just 5 minutes of new age “guidance” and I’m thrust back into the world? I’ve found far better experiences on the Quest than to recommend this. Sure, it was free, but so are others that offer way more for the storage space. Unless I’m just missing it somehow. That’s possible. But if so, it’s certainly not clear to me how to find it. I have at least 5 other free apps that do what this does and way more. Maybe they’ll add to it. No idea.","Love everything about this app. It's simple and stops everything in time to have 5minutes to myself being present. I do this eveynight before my mediations. Question, had an experience. Although I do it every night all the way to the end the stones exploded and things were in destruction. It kind of thru me off. What was that? Is there more to playing with my avatar? I can't seem to get to a menu to choose any additional practices. Is there a trick to this? Or is that the point? Is there more to this and I'm missing it? I'm happy with it as it is, but is there more? UPDATE: 3 years later... I have found that I love this short app. I usually use Presence first to get into the VR state of mind, I throw my spinning ball of light in the air and then use my arms to make it swirl and dance in the sky. Sometimes I aim for the moons, but most of the time its a 5 minute play time for me. I use my VR to meditate mostly so I use Presence as a sort of warm up. I stopped questioning it and learned to enjoy it! I can't wait to see what they do with this app. Maybe have different terrains of where you can play? Wherever it ends up going, I absolutely love this app!","But still, a very cool and VR specific one. No yoga mantras, just some weird narration and floating hands, and it ends in a couple minutes. Not bad.","Is Black Widow teaching me Dragon Ball Z? Will I meditate into a KUNG FU MASTER? Probably not. What sounds like Scarlett Johansson in desperate need of a microphone wind screen (and a few shots of espresso) teaches me to visualize myself and/or my soul as a bird with a broken wing. I sing a little Beetles tunes, and try to channel my soul into a shoryuken attack. It fails pretty bad, but hey, it's short and it's free. Watch my gameplay at the link below.
