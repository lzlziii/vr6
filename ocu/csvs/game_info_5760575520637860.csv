VRPuzlle,"Put together 3D puzzles in a beautiful and spacious surrounding. Be rewarded with a piece of art in your hands and in your own personal gallery. Choose a comfortable level of difficulty from easy, medium or hard to relax, meditate and concentrate.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Puzzle",English,0.1,drodin,drodin,https://drodin.com/vrpuzzle/,"Jun 8, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5760575520637860/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5760575520637860&r=1, https://drodin.com/vrpuzzle/#privacy-policy",332.7 MB,"So why is this called VR Puzlle in the title but VR Puzzle in the graphic. Make up your mind! This is fun, but it needs a wide variety of objects, not just seven bowls and seven heads. Also I think we should be able to see the completed form and reference it while playing. It would be just like looking at the picture on the box for a jigsaw puzzle. Overall it's fun, and it's free, but if it's going to cost money in the future it will require significant improvement.","This is soo much better than the pay apps and with beautiful art pieces, thanks for avoid anoing sounds/music, thanks for the quality graphics and the many puzzle options. For future releases I recommend Prehispanic and Egyptian sculptures as well architectual world fame structures (pyramids, sphinx of giza olmecan heads, etc).","the app i know it from the first release on sidequest, now it has become app lab. the graphics of the room, the smooth floor, the lights, the ancient works are well made. the things that are not good are the headless statues, although much better to see the statues intact. puzzles are good, but you have to give inertia. now even a small natural tremor of the hands, moving the controllers, makes the whole head of the statue shake during the reconstruction, and it is strange to see a head that should weigh many kg and have considerable inertia, behaving as if it does not have the weight. and perhaps the collisions between the various pieces should also be added, finally the statues (with heads) could also be reassembled, but at this point the pieces should fall to the ground and there should be a force of gravity, even reduced. ----- obviously it should be paid, with the changes suggesting something about 10 euros I would buy it ------ the introduction of inertia should be well calibrated, not too much, not too little. then if there was the tracking of the hands with the fingers that lean and bend on the various pieces to be assembled (therefore hands with physics and collisions) then I could also pay 14 euros",The models are a bit grey and dull but everything works and it's pleasant.,"It's Puzzling Places except with busts of faces and vases in what looks like a museum. The mechanics work well. I'd prefer an option to use the trigger to grab things, the grip button gives me hand cramps. Finishing a puzzle is a bit anticlimactic (not even a sound cue), but for free this has a lot going for it."
