Someone complained it's to loud , you can turn it down with your oculus volume control problem solved . Voice acting and story line is great! You make devices out of parts to advance the story . It's a relaxing , puzzle tinkering experience. It's only game I've ever played that captures that feeling of making something work using parts that have specific functions to solve a problem . If you're a tinkerer , builder , like to take things apart to see how they work your gonna love this game experience. It's not a rush to grind to the end game it's a chill use your brain to solve the problem. Alos there isn't one set way to build something, you can make the devices compact or big monstrosities whatever you're feeling . I shoot for estheticly pleasing myself. Lastly the cool diagnostics you can run to test your device and determine what you need is pretty cool too. Con: the device components can glitch now and then falling off the table endlessly for example. Easy fix push the reset button on the in game computer and start you build again . Components can be tricky to pull apart you might pull several others apart trying to get the one you want off . The device build difficulty increases as you would expect. If you get stuck you have to use your brain to figure out why whish apparently is a turn off some people because of that I wouldn't recommend this game for young kids . Verdict: couple bugs nothing you can't over look , great experience!","Arcsmith. The game is pretty good. Heres what i liked about it. It had really good voice acting, Great story and lore, makes you think outside the box, music is a bop, and there is no 1 way to solve a problem. Now lets take a look at the bads. It has a pretty bad tutorial, some levels are very confusing and frustrating, sometimes things just don’t work and it wont tell you or let you figure out why, and sometimes when you have everything correctly it just wont accept it. Despite all of these downsides i still think its a really fun and unique game unlike vr gun shooter for the 5 millionth time. Its a really good buy for more experienced vr users.","Decent gameplay loop, really chill tinkering game. Really should be like 3 starts but I’m being generous because it tried something different. 90% of vr games are shooters, which is cool, I love shooting things in vr, but it’s refreshing to see a game try to be something different and not another shooting/combat game and not be total trash at it.","It seemed so good! Great animations, voice acting, premise, but sadly gameplay is pretty terrible and even frustrating.","I can't turn down the radio? Seriously? No game menu at all. Voice acting was top notch, graphics looked good, some minor bugs but the music. I get you're proud of the sound track, but I shouldn't have to mute a game to play it. Played for an hour, got a headache decided to log out and see if I could find a solution online. Nope. And Meta in their infinite wisdom won't give me a refund. So congrats. Another company released another unfinished game. You got my money this time, but never again. Add the name to the list of developers not to trust. This kind of alpha release crap is why I basically quit buying games on Steam."
