There is a hand full of songs to choose from and you can choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard. DO NOT BE DECEIVED! Even the easy levels are somewhat hard! You do have to move around to dodge obstacles very quickly so if you play for a little bit, you might get a little exercise as well! Graphics I'm comparing the graphics to Pistol Whip since the games are very similar. Little different than the graphics from Pistol Whip, TROTK has a ""blocky"" arcade feel to the graphics. I honestly like this style of art much more! The graphics blends really well with the movement of the enemies in the game which is cute/funny. Replayability You could play this game for unlimited replayability but you may get a little bored if you beat ALL of the songs. It will actually be really challenging to do so therefore you'll have a lot of time to put into this game before you beat every level in the game. Difficulty The different difficulties add to the number of projectiles and enemies in the levels. The hardest part about the game is dodging obstacles that are scattered throughout since you have to move side-to-side very quickly while ducking down to dodge other things. Because of this, the easy levels were still a challenge. Comfort Level Don't worry, I get extremely motion sick in real life but I didn't notice any sickness during playing this game. Even if you're someone that gets sick, you can play with confidence! Overall, this game is extremely well-designed and I'm excited for what the game developer adds to the game in the future AND what other games they are capable of producing! If you're someone that enjoys Pistol Whip VR, this game will give you the same feel to the game while having different ""twists"" to the game, which will allow you to enjoy a new game! Well done Dev!!","This game is fun and unique and is a bit challenging even on easy, it runs great played the demo and then bought in early access same day and it is more polished than my first run-through It will have you hitting bullets with a saber that ricochet back to kill the shooter, hitting asteroids ducking and dodging obstacles and force breaking walls all before you get hit too many times and run out of life energy to end your run The team is great I had an issue with my early access key working with the official app lab release they were very responsive and quickly got me fixed up",I was able to learn the game in just a few minutes and it has the right amount of challenge to keep me interested. It was so immersive and fun that I just kept playing and I didnâ€™t even realize what a workout it is until I looked at my Fitbit later. Looking forward to playing some more today!
