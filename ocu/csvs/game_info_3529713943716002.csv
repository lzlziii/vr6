That cliff hanger at the end has insane! Espire 3 PLEASE!! Everything about this game is perfect! The cheats (got all of them) are fun and so is the operations!! Worth the money even if it was $50!! Ok it‚Äôs been awhile and I still play operation snow blind every day. It‚Äôs been crashing a lot lately, this screen just freezes and my operation is just a rectangle and there is a black void around me. Then the game sends me to oculus home after a few seconds. Odd. Espire Ops added a nice touch to the game. Suggestions to make the game better? I have one. It would make the game a perfect 10/10 (right now 9/10) my suggestion is melee weapons. Yes, not just the healing tool. Maybe an axe, knife, machete, a pencil, (lol jk). Scatter them around missions, Have some guards have knives, in the mess hall massacre Espire Op add some forks and knives. Please be creative and put in some deep consideration about this review. Please. This game needs something different! The first game is bad, the second one is awesome! VERY EXCITED FOR MR MISSION WE NEED A RELEASE DATE! Hey what happened I need to get back on top, HIT HELPFUL, QUICK, BEFORE THE SLAM IS FIRED!!","I played the first game to death when I had my PlayStation vr, and it was the first game I bought on quest. This game did help with the news about splinter cell being cancelled. Although it does have problems, the biggest is that not many people (me included) wants to play as sooty. I did think it was cool to have two different robots for the campaign but it was a mistake for online multiplayer. A way to fix it is to have two of each bot. This way if the other person wants to play as the bigger robot then both you and the other person can. It will also let the choose to be the smaller one if that‚Äôs what they prefer. I don‚Äôt want people to read this review and this this isn‚Äôt a good game, cause it is. It also isn‚Äôt saying sooty isn‚Äôt fun to play as because both are enjoyable. It is saying that people have a preference for their bot and I haven‚Äôt seen many who prefer to play as sooty. Again, amazing game that you should try. That is the only thing that I can think of that is ‚Äúbad‚Äù about this game because otherwise it‚Äôs pretty fun and well made with a lot of love put in.","25 Percent OFF Espire 2 Below apprefferal.bio.link Copy and paste into any browser Espire 2 is an Amazing and fast-paced game unlike any other game on Oculus Quest 2. Espire 2 has VOICE commands. To me, this is a huge improvement to VR as you can interrogate guards from raising their hands to getting them on the ground. There are currently 4 missions that are very fun and long. Each level is around 35 minutes of playtime. You can also try to do it quickly to be on leaderboards. It should be on every must-buy list.",This is the best stealth game ever. Great story fun multiplayer and a good addition definitely not a cash grab. This was the same enough to be a direct sequel but different enough to be a new game. This is the legend of Zelda tears of the kingdom of vr
