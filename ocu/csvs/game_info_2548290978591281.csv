It's here that the game totally glitches and won't let her complete it. Very frustrating for a game that is supposed to be relaxing. :(","It's cute, and fun to place things in the little scenes but the same activity over and over I got bored. When I connected the stars and pinch it to awaken it sometimes it takes a loooong time to activate and it's frustrating. Predictable and repetitious. I was expecting something else I guess. Disappointed.","This is such a hidden gem! At the time of my writing, this game has just 28 reviews - how is that possible? The graphics are beautiful, the narrator is perfect and the experience itself is just amazing! The game is something between a puzzle game and an interactive story. Just buy it, itâ€™s great!","I downloaded this several days before I played it. I work in Healthcare and my empathy was waning. On a whim I opened Luna and started to follow the story. It restored my empathy and I found it completely enchanting. Even though I went through the whole thing, I will return to Luna again. A wonderful story, well told and well presented."
