Time Titans VR Demo,"Time Titans VR is a singleplayer action shooter that allows the user to manually slow down time to get an advantage in combat. Shoot, punch and slice through enemies while slowing down time to unleash mayhem or dodge counter attacks. Slow time at the push of a button while you move freely to wreak havoc on the opposition. Gun down enemies during the slow motion bliss. Bash your enemies to pieces with maces, battleaxes, sais, swords and an assortment of other melee weapons. Test your moral compass as you're put through simulated ethical dilemmas to see if you're worthy of joining ""The Corporation"" to work as a mercenary. Your decisions will impact the story and determine if you get the job after the grueling interview process. Are you the right fit for the job? Find out.

Do you like super hot? go on, probably you are going to love it! The best feature (in contrast) is darker backgrounds.",I have played some of the demo and have been very impressed so far. The game has a similar feel to Superhot VR game and really hope they release the full version soon but at a cheaper price than its competitor. A very promising shooting/combat game.,A copy of superhot with some interesting ideas on where they differ. Not bad - but still needs a lot of work and polish.
