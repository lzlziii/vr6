In my opinion potential buyers should ignore the two star review by GamerTag! Regarding GamerTag known as GT; If you ever watched his channel - GT is NO 'Mr intelligence' ( if you catch my drift) and definitely lacks any kind of sense of humor and I will explain; Crimen is all about timing as in hacking & slashing from the right direction at the right time similar to Beat saber ( in an odd way ) however GT has a brainless 'run & gun' style in general. The problem with GT's review is that he completely misunderstood the game mechanics! GT ignored the timing and opted for brainless impatient hacking & slashing at his own will - and of course GT was unsuccessful. So what does Mr Genius GT do? He blames it on the developer's and leaves a 2 star review which is very misleading and unfair on the developer's! At a certain point in GT's review he looks at a woman's character who is locked in a trance (or possessed) her eyes are white because of her state - so genius Mr GT points out that her eyes are not looking at him or missing! GT's IQ must be equivalent to his shoe number lol! Crimen Mercenaries is very polished, has a lovely style of sharp cartoon graphics (with beautiful dramatic scenes & views), good gameplay and a great sense of humor giving you a nice little workout while fighting. I have tried Crimen and I'm definitely loving this game - just buy it and see for yourself! Five stars from me. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê. Update following developer's response; Dear Carbon Studio That is very large and kind of you....and diplomatic ü§£ I know how hard it is to develope a successful vr game and the high skill needed to succeed. I also know how easy it is to start a vr YouTube channel ( no skill needed ) and start criticising everyone. YouTube content creators can behave as self nominated critic's at times- delivering harsh and unmeasured verdict's that can destroy a developer's game and ruin a puchisers experience - especially when online gaming is involved. If you look carefully at the wording used in GT's YouTube review of Crimen - including all the many things he likes about Crimen - a well measured content creator would have given a minimum of 3 stars after speaking those words NOT 2 stars! Which Leeds me to believe that GT was not being sincere in his review. I will explain; GT borrows other content creators language who are more professional, intelligent and measured than GT to camouflage the fact that he really can be a twatt, and that is why he sounds reasonable but the verdict he delivers is harsh in comparison! Self nominated critic Mr GT's verdict was harsh in my opinion - GT and other self nominated critic's have done this many times in the past - again , sometimes destroying online games as fewer people purchase the game and move on. so in my humble opinion GamerTag can be at times Mr 'Gamer Twatt' who needs to be put in his place - and that's why I was harsh on him lol. In short it's called 'Karma delivered and served' üòé","I like the fun and creative side to the approach of this game, its funny, gameplay is fun but it needed more. At times it could be frustrating to fight multiple enemies who block your attacks and it took away the fun in the gameplay but wasnt a big issue. The climbing would be challenging at times because at some points in a climb you would get stuck or couldnt move. I figured out if you center yourself inbounds it fixes the problem of climbing if anyone was wondering The blackscreen was also an issue because when an enemy walked through you or was to close everything just goes black and that goes for walls in the map as well, once you put your head through you cant see anything and the boundaries of the game just need some maintenance. The stories you play through the characters were just to similar and all you do is fight and reach a destination which there wasnt really anything to the game. All in all in gets two stars for being fun and comically creative but other than that it needs to go back to the drawing board my good sirs and maams. My advice: So you want my advice on how to improve your game? Well let me just say this...add places to visit and sight see cause scenery never gets old. You had cannons at your disposal and that could have been used by a big character who wields firepower and it was fun using those hand cannons so I would have had levels just for shooting and blowing up things. Adventure? where is it? Well let me tell ya, its people, places and your unlimited supply to the imagination. Now, im not asking for skyrim amount of adventure but ya know, helping people, slaying a beast, making friends and maybe even mini games. I feel that it needed more interaction with the world. Bar brawls, arm wrestling, mountain climbing, body slams, romances, castle raids, a point where you turn into a werewolf and tear through enemies, fly...I mean theres alot I expected but maybe my expectations are unrealistic but I hope some things are taken into consideration. Anyhow thank you for the fun game, farewell.","I love the stories in this - the exploration of different historical times and places and the combat is fun as well. Only took off a star because I think the combat could be a little bit more engaging. I know it's purposefully ""arcadey"" but the enemies and combat become a bit ""samey"" animation-wise and I think there's room for variety even within the arcade feel that they're going for. But still a ton of fun. Absolutely worth full price! Or get is 25prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot): b i t , l y / c m t f r i e n d","One of my favourite games of the year so far (2023), the stories are both challenging and humorous, the art style is a cel shaded masterpiece, the charactets are all quirky individuals and the combat mechanics have been implemented to near perfection.",I prveviously gave a disappointing review. But I realized that this game is structured differetly. This makes itt a good game. The Pirate mission is amazing. The graphics and controls are great. the ideas are good.
