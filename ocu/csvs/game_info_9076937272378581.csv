Downhill Bike simulates riding a mountain bike down a rugged path. Become one with nature and conker that hill. The controls in Downhill Bike feel great, just like holding onto a set of handle bars. The bike give you a great feel of being on a bike. I even found myself standing up time to time when starting to peddle or bunny hopping. This is a free demo on SideQuestVR and I would highly recomene3d trying it out. Bike fans will love this one. Watch my preview here, https://youtu.be/Ow_11rBjjGM",I actually like this game I was looking for a dirt bike game but then I came across this downloaded it and it was super!cool and I don’t play it much anymore because I found a good dirt bike game but I would recommend this game to mountain bike people.,I miss rideing my bike and this is the right game if you want to try it out and you miss it bye,"looking around just doesn’t feel as right, the 6° of freedom are limited in this game… Almost made me keep it, but the limiting factor of freedom doesn't feel ""natural""",Rlly good
