It's easy enough to get started, but once you get stuck there's no way that I can see to continue to the next page, and the ""give up"" button doesn't do anything. I would expect it to then reshuffle the stones, but it just asks if you're sure that you want to give up and takes you back to the main menu. If you then pick the same board again, the stones hsve the exact same positions that they had when you chose to give up. Currently I'm stuck in such a situation and cannot continue. There's also some dices on the table that can be thrown, but they don't seem to do anything either? For the price it's quite polished and nice, but it needs a way to move forward without getting stuck."
