Cosmic Flow: A Relaxing VR Experience,"Cosmic Flow is a relaxing visual experience, an audio-visual massage for the mind, a kaleidoscopic meditation. Cosmic Flow was developed by an artist as a first part of a series of VR experiences encouraging connection and personal expression. A relaxed mind is better able to understand and express itself. Cosmic Flow hopes to instill this feeling of relaxation so that, when the headset comes off, the feeling continues.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity, Relaxation/Meditation",English,1.8,vedev,self,http://vedev.cc/cosmicflow,"May 26, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3872076276162726/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3872076276162726&r=1, https://vedev.cc/cosmicflow-privacy/",174.7 MB,"Would you like to spend some time inside a gargantuan kaleidoscopic Chinese finger trap that has been soaked in a smoothie made from psilocybin and cosmic rays? If so, download now. Pair with headphones and your favorite music. Enjoy. Hoping to eventually see some expansion on this really cool idea.",Is great for what it is - and potential to be so much more.,"As a high school senior it's been stressful and tiring. Opened this app I've felt at peace and relaxed. Being able to control everything in this app, including creating galaxies with your controller, while you're mind is at peace feels breath taking, and it's all FREE!!! I highly recommend this for people that's stressed!",Love this felt so trippy def a must try,"This is almost as good for my blood pressure as petting a puppy. One of my favorite areas is where the waves converge and the colors flow in all directions. I only have two wishlist items: 1. I'd like to be able to my own music tracks - harp or panpipes would be awesome with this experience. 2. I'd like to be able to adjust the colors, for instance pick a range of the spectrum or just one color in different shades, and also to use only deeper or brighter tones, depending on my mood. For me those two additions would push the app past perfection."
