CPR Simulator,"This type of training is often difficult to get access to, because it often requires an expert instructor, CPR Training Equipment (doll, AED, hygiene material, etc.), and a lot of time. CPR Simulator makes CPR training widely available in a simple, intuitive, and customisable way. Almost every person needs to go through CPR training one or two times in their life, and many professionals are required to go through it every year or every second year. AATE VR has partnered up with First-8, who's a renowned company, selling first aid courses and material to both consumers and big companies. More environments/scenarios will be added, types of citizens to resuscitate, variations of AED models will be incorporated, and NPC’s will be added after release.",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,", Health & Fitness","English, Danish",2.01,AATE VR,AATE VR,https://aatevr.com/,"Jun 14, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5019990081404984/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5019990081404984&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nF9x3658ovfvDoo2C6i5clupYAiGe4TwFG3wLTqlwJw/edit",297.5 MB,"A nice app in early stages. I can see it becoming very useful. VR is an underutilised training medium and with community defibrillators becoming quite common and many people knowing the basics, this can be used as a training aid in the community and people can do quick training at home. It is too simplistic, but that is easily remidied. I like the putting the phone on speakerphone after calling the emergency services ( it is still wise to encourage them to shout out for help, as doing CPR is more efficient with 2 people, a third can look out for the ambulance as speed matters. And doing CPR is extremely tiring and lonely on your own. Don't just shout help as people may think you are being assaulted ( if you are ever being assaulted shout fire, everyone loves a good fire and people will come and look, it will also unnerve the assailant) and may run away, shout ""help someone has collapsed call an ambulance"".) Also encourage them to sing a song in their head or out loud that has the correct rapid rhythm for CPR ( Nelly the Elephant or Staying Alive) The Defib needs to remind people to stand clear, which the person pushing the button should also do. After they have recovered consider putting them in the recovery position if they are groggy, make them comfortable. It is wise to remind the individual to check the area quickly, they may have been electrocuted or some other hazard. They may be in water and defibrilating them may injure them or someone else. Admittedly it is obvious in the app that there is no water, but in the heat of the moment people forget the obvious ( that it is tipping down or there is a large puddle or petrol fumes) and it needs to be drummed into them before they go into autopilot, that is the benefit of training. I am sure all this will be added in future. Along with country specific emergency numbers, national basic cardiac life support protocols or even an international standard. It is nice to have things as simple as possible, sadly life is never simple and cutting corners costs lives, hence why I pointed out so many little things. I look forward to seeing how this develops in the future","so i got this app for free to test, and i tested it on about 10 peoples and i can say a lot of peoples like it a lot, it is easy to use, and have really good step by step guide and it cover stuff like 911 call and similar stuff, peoples told me thank you for letting me to try this",Some knowledge in life can be invaluable. Through a set of easy to follow instructions and by taking a quiz at the same time you learn how to potentially save a person's life by performing CPR. Great application for classrooms even businesses and generally for everyone. Really well made!,"Disclaimer: I received a free code to try this app. CPR simulator does a very good job at explaining the process of attending to a person suffering a cardiac emergency. Precise positioning is explained as well as the process from head tilt, to compressions, and even to AED usage. You are performing against a timer and are responsible for summoning help, just as if it was a real world situation. Victims are anatomically proper, with both male and female victim available for practice. You are even given a guide you can “talk to” for assistance. This should not necessarily be used as a substitute for initial live in person training, but is an excellent refresher and practice tool to use after you receive certification. As a law enforcement officer/first responder, I would highly recommend this app.",Really good for in case you forget or need to rewiew your skills !
