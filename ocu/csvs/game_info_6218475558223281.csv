I love picking out bones and want to play with the mushy stuff! Come on work an option out please as the b oney bits really great!,"I like a few others on here downloaded without reading the reviews .. it’s good and has great potential as a teaching aid , but unless your happy just looking at and zooming in an out of a single skeleton don’t bother with this app. Overall 6/10 only because the detail is good on the small amount we actually get to view",I want to know how much this game is because I accidentally buyed it,I downloaded it expecting it to be free but it’s not plus your only limited to skeleton views.. This is a groundbreaking app that has limitless potential… I would suggest u allow guest to view everything the app has to offer for a short period just so they can see the value… Once other developers put out another app such as this for a cheaper price beat believe this app will be left on the shelf !!! So it would be wise to appeal to average non student as well as the medical community….asap!,Waste of time unless you want to pay crazy amounts. It’s cheaper to buy a book
