If so, Please mark review as helpful👍🏽 onward is a good game. It's fun and I enjoy playing it. The only problem is that there are to many kids playing it. They are so toxic and cannot go into a lobby without a kid that is cussing or acting like he owns the game. I am 14, which I guess is a kid or a teen, but I don't try to act like I am tough. I am more of the serious kind and try to let the adults do their things. I only talk when I am trying to make callouts. Another problem I have is when shooting, the weapon randomly jumps out of my grip and the recoil makes the gun go up. I don't know if that is a realistic feature or something. If your a parent, and your kid is asking to get this game, please don't. If your kid is under the age of 13, get them zero caliber or pavlov. Onward is more for the adults. This is not call of duty, this is more of a serious kind of game, so kids, keep to your self and stop talking or just don't get the game. 👍🏼 I highly recommend to anyone who wants a shooter and definitely worth buying as your first game.",I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets I need more bullets,"Graphics: Real life Impressive Good Decent ✅ Nintendo 64 Trash ——————————————————————— Artistic Style: (kind of subjective) Telltale game God tier indie game Comic ✅ 90s shooter Mobile game Too realistic to count ————————————————————————— Gameplay: Titanfall 2 Intense cerebral stimulation 😵‍💫 Excellent ✅ Good Fetch quests x1000 Point and click ————————————————————————— Difficulty: That one level you couldn’t beat when you were 9 years old Dark Souls Tricky Intuitive, but hard to master ✅ Easy Very easy ————————————————————————— Uniqueness: Never been done Original Original concept, generic execution ✅ Zombies WW2 shooter Battle Royale Every game ever 😳 ————————————————————————— Appropriate age: Elderly Adult ✅ Older teen/young adult ✅ Teen/tween ✅ Child (Screaming) toddler Out of the womb ————————————————————————— Fear (common in even non horror vr titles) Sh!tting myself (Good) haunted house film Korean zombies Traditional zombies (Bad) haunted house film Loud noises ✅ Peppa pig Amytiville Horror (sh@te film)","I've reviewed a few games lately, such things as contractors, into the radius and zero caliber. However I kept coming back to Onward for reasons that'll be explained. (For people that are wondering if they should get the game, you may want to read this) First of all, the gameplay is always different, I've stayed clear of PVP, but I've invested a lot of time into PVE which is just astonishing. The right blend of combat and strategy just feels right. The maps and community made maps are fun to say the least, especially bazaar and suburbia, which have become my favourite maps to play when I'm late night gaming or just generally getting some exercise in. Secondly, I want to talk about gun play, which for a VR FPS game, you've gotta have good gunplay, and I must say Onward has it. Recently with the recent update they added weight to the guns so you can't run at like 400 mph with an M240L (One of the new guns btw). But are decently quick with an MP5 or a M16. This game has an array of weapons suited to fit however you want to play, want to be a marksman? Go into battle with a DMR or a Sniper. Want to be a machine gunner? Take an LMG. Additionally, the way the game actually plays out is a big thing for me, given the fact that to enjoy this game fully, you need a decently sized play area so you can crouch and lay down should you need to. Finally, my personal opinion if you're looking for the closest thing to VR Milsim you've found it. I highly recommend this to my fellow Milsim geeks. (Add on suggestions) I don't have much to suggest, however what a do have as a suggestion, is the addition of an M4A1, and a USP45, maybe possibly an SA86 or L85A2 basically the AR version of the L86LSW currently in-game.","Here is my feedback dumbed down to categories after hours of me playing the game!! (If you are thinking of buying any game, message me on oculus and I will give you a code for 25percent off!! Also if you have any questions about the game I can help!! I respond QUICK!!)

I do recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun time to hop in anytime to shoot up the battlefields. I Will get you the 25 percent off code I promise, I’m case you don’t believe me, I have no reason not to do it because it benefits me to get these codes out!! MESSAGE ME!!! Helpful?..🙏"
