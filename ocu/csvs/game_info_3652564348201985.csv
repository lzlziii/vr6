Tomorrow Ends,"It's doomsday and only three hours are left to save Arkala town. The clock is ticking, the townsfolk are in distress, the townsfolk are lying. The townsfolk are lying ?

You have to walk around and figure out all the clues from what the villagers are saying and find the items you need. Took me three weeks,"if you like to walk, and i mean WALK, nonstop, then this is the game for you. very little to do, just walking around and around in circles. everything is very spaced out. you need an apple, walk 16 miles to get it, then walk 16 miles back. was it the right apple? we'll never know. just walk 16 miles back to get another one and 16 miles again. don't know where to go? just walk a million miles until you find another person to get a hint."
