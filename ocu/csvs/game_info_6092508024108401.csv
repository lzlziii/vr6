Fundamental Force,"NEW! The endless mode is finally out! Compete with your friends in 3 new levels of endless enemy waves! Fundamental Force is a game that challenges your spatial thinking over 21 mind-blowing celestial levels. Fight against mysterious creatures in Escher-style environments and deny laws of physics! Forget what ""up"" and ""down"" means, you can change the direction of gravity at any time. Ever wanted to walk on walls or to stroll along the ceiling? Weâ€™ve got a solution! Feel the true freedom of movement by picking one of the two gravity changing devices. TACHYON allows you to teleport onto any flat surface and make it your new floor. Appear out of nowhere to catch the enemy off guard, then disappear in an instant! With GRAVITON, you can change gravity in place, meaning that you will start falling towards your new ""floor"". Keep switching the gravity while you are falling, and now you can fly! Use the gravity, find your way, dodge and pick the right moments to shoot and you will win!",3+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Puzzle, Shooter",English,0.4,The Ring Robotics,The Ring Robotics,https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6092508024108401/,"Aug 4, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6092508024108401/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6092508024108401&r=1, http://fundamentalforce.freecluster.eu/privacy_policy.html?i=1",687.6 MB,"UPDATE: I've changed my tune a bit on this game. While conceptually cool, there are some glaring limitations that negatively impact the overall experience. As part of gameplay, you navigate your way through MC Escher-esque environs by teleporting to different surfaces. There is no rhyme or reason as to which surfaces you're ""allowed"" to transport onto. Not only does it make the game less fun and immersive, it also makes the puzzle-solving aspect too linear. Another element of the teleportation is to create and place cubes to teleport onto. Apparently you can only teleport onto certain surfaces of the cube, and again, there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason as to which of the 6 sides you can access. They also don't seem to correctly place where I want them to, or the possible locations are *just* out of reach. The mechanism to do so is just clunky and it seems unnecessary. Finally, the difficulty seems inconsistent and absolutely absurd. I reached the 8th level (out of 21), ""Diamond"", with relative ease, but I don't think it's remotely possible to finish the level, even on easy difficulty. It's just too difficult to awkwardly try to place these cubes to get near the spawning ball while being rapidly shot at. Kill the enemy and another one immediately spawns. I realize that the game is meant to be disorienting but it's just absolutely frantic and awkward. I'd love to find some sort of discord or discussion for this app because I just don't see how passing this level is possible. It's a shame because there are some other elements of this game that are pretty cool. Wow. This game has loads of potential. I haven't even unlocked the gravitron yet but I can only imagine what it will do. Only seven levels in and I'm hooked. The game's central concepts are so incredibly unique and innovative. A few (admittedly unsolicited) ideas for improvement: First, and foremost: the background in the first few levels is beautiful. However, if the clouds in the background were animated with a slow, steady, consistent wind rather than a frozen stillshot, the immersion factor would skyrocket (at least on the first few levels). If all of the levels in story mode were sequentially connected with continuous transitions, it would give the game a better feeling of purpose. Once the player reached the green spot near the gate of each level, the screen could momentarily gray or blur out a bit to show the score and statistics, and then focus or zoom back in to introduce the beginning of the next level. The general background music is beautifully atmospheric and slightly haunting, but any sort of combat triggers an abrupt shift to a really cheesy, not great song. Why change it? The devs have really come up with something special here. I hope there will be some updates and further development in the future.",Love this,"Came across this today and it's an excellent puzzle shooter. Nice graphics and may trouble you if you have dodgy VR legs. I've only played 3-4 levels so far and am addicted. Lots of levels and an endless mode to unlock. There is potential here for creating your own levels but that all depends obviously on the developers. Weapons are nice and would like a few more different ones (maybe there are later in the game?). Also hopefully the enemies are more varied later in the game too. That said, this is a bargain and worthy of your money and time! Highly recommended!!",*** GREAT ***,"UPDATE: After uninstalling and re-installing for a third time (with a break between the reinstall), the game finally let me get through the first (and tutorial level). Thanks to the developer for getting back to me on this; I'm glad to say the game now works, and is quite interesting, in a topsy-turvy kind of way. Haven't had a chance to get very far into it, yet, but I'll update my review once I do so. unfortunately, the game won't let me get past even the first level before freezing up (using Oculus Quest 1). If I restart it, it again freezes up at approximately the same point it froze before, which is quite early in the tutorial portion of the game. I find this tremendously disappointing, as I think playing in an Esheresque world would be a total kick. For now, I'm going to give the game 4 stars, so as not to mess with the rating of a game that I think has tremendous potential--and for the very well-done and fairly detailed polygons that make up what little of the play area I got to see. I do think the enemies could do with a bit more visual depth, but hopefully, that, along with a fix to this freezing problem, will be handled in the near future. Keep going on this, developers; you potentially have a very good game on your hands. Hope these issues get handled soon, so I can give it a proper try."
