It feels much like Dragon Quest 1, but with VR flare. I do wish there was some movement customization, but the step locomotion was strangely not a problem for me, as I do suffer from motion sickness. The game could've even incorporated motion controls for attack and magic - which would've made it more immersive. The style is very retro and 8-bit inspired, which I find charming. The music and sound is great. While I haven't finished quite yet, I've read the game is quite short and localization has some misspellings - but for the price, you should definitely get this game to enjoy!"
