Controls were hard to get used to and not really sur why I found a bunch of things but only found 1 out of 6 secrets. Don't get wrong graphi s and rooms are huge amazing but just expected mor then only a chapter for a 17$ game. Also thought it would b several puzzles n each room it was mor like one small puzzle per room so it wasn't horrible I did hav fun on the puzzle for the room just expected way mor then what I got WAY too short, so honestly would've paid maybe 7 to 10$ at most caus of lack of content hope that mor is added caus kinda bummed a tad.","Some bugs sometimes but it’s a plaisant game. But it seems have no saving function. I mean If I leave the game, it restarts at the first room and this is very boring to play the same rooms again and again. Also if I die, it would be cool to stay in the same room and not to go back in the first one. Is there improvements planned?",Was enjoying playing this game despite all the bugs and hard to use controls until I died and it kept spawning me to a place where it instantly killed me again so I was unable to continue the game. The only way was to restart from the begining which I didn't really want to do as I had spent a good amount of time on the game. I did message the developers regarding this issue a few days ago but I have had no response although they have read the message. Very disappointed I am unable to finish the game.,"This COULD be a very good game. However, it is very glitchy, it crashes a lot, the settings have to be reset after every restart, or every time you die, the inventory is too clutted and items keep disappearing or going miniature, and the controls are awkward! Otherwise the game is pretty cool ;-)","It's a good game, inmersive and funny, but my wife can't play it because it doesn't have teleport and gets sick. Me also, a little less, but I think it would be an easy modification and very useful for other people."
