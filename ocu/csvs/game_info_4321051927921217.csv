I also wish you could have a limit to how big your animals get. Other than that it‚Äôs a great and fun game you can put a lot of hours intoüëåüòÅ","As an open world Farming game, it does its job well, could definitely use some QoL additions but as of now it‚Äôs a pretty good farming game Bugs: as being a game it‚Äôs bound to have bugs, First off and most annoying, bushes TANK your frame rate, get too close and the game becomes a powerpoint presentation Rocks love to take flight when you hit their edges Sometimes things just kinda no-clip out of reality When grabbing something, sometimes it isn‚Äôt highlighted and the grab is super delayed The small trees (slightly taller than the player) cannot be stored, you can still interact with them and use them but looking away from where it was cut causes the cut logs to despawn, they respawn when you look back at the area Sometimes inventory slots stop working and it requires you to restart the game I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs a bug but your character has the weight of an anvil In one part of the map the terrain tears, I forgot where said tear was but when I find it I‚Äôll show an image **Some ideas for the game** 3 More inventory slots, I don‚Äôt believe that 6 is enough due to the amount of things in the game and how easy it is to stumble upon them An easier way to store items, I think picking them up and putting them in your inventory is fine but I think it would be better to pick them up and put them in a wrist bag or put it behind your back like you have a backpack on Speaking of backpacks, I think the inventory being in a backpack fits much more with the theme of the game and I think putting your favorite tools on each side of the bag would be nice, I think the ability to lock built items in place would be nice, like hitting it with one of the tools would lock it in place, you can‚Äôt move it and you would hit it with the same tool to unlock the item Taking a bit of inspiration from A Township Tale, the ability to grab more than one item at once from your inventory would help so much, and it would work similarly to ATT where you can grab single items out of it, split it and pick items up easier with it In all the game is pretty good as it is now but could be better 8/10",Water flings out of your bucket and planting some foods Costa more then what you gain from it so it's a scam market Example a carrot costs 3 coins to buy the see and when you fully grow it the carrot sells from 1 you can't profit in Thai game and another bug is trying to pick stuff up it locks your hand sometimes and causes your hand to go crazzy you can hand fish for fish so the rod is useless and animals that are not contained leave to the mountains outside the boarder so you will never see them again and The BUSH if you go close to A bush you will lagg more then 100k tnt I'm Minecraft,UPDATE: dev has messaged me and is interested in making the game better which is excellent. They implement some better accessibility features in the last update that make playing the game much more bearable. There is still much more to be improved upon to make this accessible friendlier and improve UX. But I‚Äôm hopeful dev will implement them. ‚Äî‚Äî- OG REVIEW I saw the dev videos on Reddit and thought it looks great and they often seem to be adding stuff as I‚Äôve seen a couple posts lately I don‚Äôt understand why they are adding new stuff when not fixing the core mechanics of the game first. There is so much potential here but fairly garbage execution. Issues: - tree chopping - how to we store and carry wood to the saw mill and soil maker? Please look at raccoon lagoon for how the chopping works and make similar. How it is right now is highly frustrating and just not good - fishing: how do we even hook a fish? Zero instructions and the mechanics for the rod are horrendous - mining: I used the pick axe under the waterfall and nothing happened at all. Made no sense - dropping a vegetable they disappear sometimes - grab zones - very very finicky- especially the storage wallet. Why is the secondary button not assigned to that? Like the tools is to primary? Next the setting watch just either tap to open or use the menu button on the left hand. Both the watch and wallet don‚Äôt grab half the time - horse: pulling back on the reigns does not stop the horse but letting them go does There are many more. Dev: you have an extremely good idea for the game and the graphics are fairly decent. Please please focus on fixing what is broken before adding new features. You only get one chance to impress people and mechanics is super important if not the most important thing next to graphics. I‚Äôd happily upgrade my review from 2 stars if you fixed these issues. As it stands it‚Äôs not worth a purchase and this should‚Äôve been release as a private/public beta test on discord first vs asking for money from users. Your buggy build is standing in the way of success because your rating from reviews will be low and people will be less likely to buy due to that. People also rarely come back and change reviews. You‚Äôre shooting yourself in the foot. And those who want to support you well are risking handing over money without promise of fixes because poor overall rating means it won‚Äôt be feasible for you to update if you‚Äôre not making money.,"I know this game is still in its infancy but there are some minor issues I have after playing this game for a few hours. The store barrel most of the time doesn‚Äôt allow you to sell items and they just fall into the barrel and become unretrievable. The pumpkin seeds turn into tomato seeds no matter if you put them in storage or carry them and plant them directly into the soil. Other than that, the game is a blast to play. I wish there was a way to report in game issues other than ‚ÄúReport Abuse‚Äù as there is nothing but NPC‚Äôs in the game."
