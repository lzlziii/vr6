Things I would like to see from future updates: 1. The non-dominant hand seems to unused. It would be great if it rotated the screens. 2. I would like the screens to be larger, an option for 4 screens that are larger would be great. 3. The current websites disappear if you go back to the menu, which could cause problems. If the app remembered where the current pages you are on it would help a lot. 4. Better full screen capability. I tried to watch a youtube video but full screen wasn't allowed. An adjustment to this would be really helpful. I will be using this as my primary browser inside my headset from now on. Great job dev(s)!",what it's supposed to be is hard to understand. Completely non-intuitive whatever it's function is.
