Is it perfect yet? No. But the game keeps me busy. Returning to the game now somehow gets me nostalgic of those MMOs I played as a kid. I love chatting with people, being in this world does a lot for me mentally. It's positive. Now before in my initial review I was quite poor due to them axing the original speed flying. Devs just keep this a feature. I love, no I NEED this in the game. And I'm sure 90% can agree. Right now it's honestly perfect, I'll be watching y'all ;) Good game. 5/5 for me. I'm having a good time.","My review üìù: This anime like graphics are insane! The developers are doing an awesome job, not only in graphics but in the story, combat, and map too! This is the most addicting and out of the extraordinary game I‚Äôve ever played! Glitch & Communityüí¨: This game is amazing, but it‚Äôs not totally completed, it does have a few glitches in some missions and in some parts of the map you can glitch and fall through the map, but I‚Äôm sure the developers will fix them soon! Not only the developers are amazing but the community too! First time, I played I meet so many nice and cool people, this game has the best community I‚Äôve ever seen! GameplayüéÆ: The gameplay it self makes this game earn 100 stars! This game has such an awesome combat! The developers added the arena option so that you can fight against your friends! It‚Äôs an impeccable gameplay and I love gliding around the map! Go ahead, buy the game, make your character and choose you class, I promise you, this game is a BLAST! Conclusion: I totally recommend this game and the money is totally worth it, 1000 stars, great job developers and thanks for this amazing community!","I bought this game in August of 2022 with my friend, we had so much fun playing together but I quit because of the lack of fun things to do. But recently when I came back I found agent rank better dungeons alot more people another class and I had a BLAST this is such an amazing game you can cook too!!! I love it so much And I recommend it to everyone reading this and you will not regret buying it","I'll keep it short and sweet, the base game no beer goggles is amazing. BUT you must recognise with a small dev team there is a lot of room to grow. But have faith for further updates and content give the game the chance it deserves! 8-9/10 For once in an MMO people look at your grinding with respect because you physically put yourself through every movement, whether it be cooking, healing or straight up slaying mobs by yourself or with others. The fun experiences interacting in the world with hundreds of other people make Zenith a unique and captivating world which will draw you into VR on a whole different level. This really is the next big thing for VR so get in and start with the world while you can!"
