Shoottris,"This is not the classic game. ItÂ´s a new way to play. With Shoottris you will enjoy a new gaming experience. You will have to change the way you think because the pieces do not rotate. Why are they going to rotate if you can shape them as you want with your ray? Use your ray to break the blocks and give the pieces the shape that suits you. Care, every piece has a limit of blocks than you can break to sculpt it. Two game modes: - Levels: 36 levels await you. Do you think you can overcome them all? - Resistance mode: How long and how many lines can you get? The difficulty increases with time.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Casual, Puzzle","English, Spanish (Spain)",1.011,Palvesoft S.L.,PalveSoft,https://www.palvesoft.com/,"Mar 30, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5067992976605622/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5067992976605622&r=1, https://www.palvesoft.com/aviso-legal",150.3 MB,"Love this. One of the most addictive games I have played. Been stuck on level 12 for a week. I won't give up. I can't, it's that type of game."
