Spear Master,"Spear-throwing Challenge is a fast-paced and addictive game that tests your aim and dexterity. In this game, you'll take turns throwing a spear at a target, with the goal of hitting the bullseye or a designated area on the target to progress to the next section. You'll be racing against an AI opponent, so you'll need to be quick and accurate if you want to come out on top. The difficulty increases as you progress through the sections, with longer distances, more challenging targets, and obstacles to avoid. So what are you waiting for? Download Spear-Master today and see if you have what it takes to become the ultimate champion!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Casual",English,0.4,AM APPS,AM Apps,http://www.am-apps.at/,"Feb 27, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5693862130712344/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5693862130712344&r=1, http://www.am-apps.at/wordpress/?page_id=81",292.8 MB,"Graphics and skill challenges are enjoyable. Despite being able to progress through several levels today, I never figured out what throwing motion to use in order to get consistent results, so a brief tutorial or at least an introductory diagram illustrating the correct throwing motion would be useful. Also, I didn't see a way to pause the game for future resumption or how to return to the home menu. Also, a leader board would be welcome. I think this has potential to become a 4-star game after further coding.",Really cool game!! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,"Went to play first time, and it was Upside-down."
