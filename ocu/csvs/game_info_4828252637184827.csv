I’m never going to class yoga ever again. It’s beautiful. It’s what I’ve always wanted. It’s a serene environment. Easy to follow. Nice drop sound so you know the pose is changing. No one barking orders at you. It’s meditative yet gives me the stretches and workout I need. Big thumbs up. I had given up on yoga and now I’m doing it daily. The only problem I have is when the poses want my head down and the headset loses tracking but hopefully this is a problem learning glitch.,I love this! Just wish there was a way to see if I'm doing the pose correct when my head is down... like an outline or a slight water reflexion below me... Also might want to make the drop sound a tiny bit louder for position changes. And a settings choice to display or announce the name of the pose.,"First of all i like the app and i think it will very good with some small updates. I miss a notification when its time to change positions, there is a timer infront of me that shows nothing. Now i have to check the dummies to know and that is messing up the posture. With a timer and a notification to change position a had given tha app five stars.","I’m new to yoga. This app was right up my ally. But it’s not there yet. First problem are exercise choices. I’ve no idea what I’m picking etc. no idea for time. Second issue. The instructor(s). You can’t see them if you’re not looking at them. So the whole thing is spent just looking at them. Would be good to have a pose overlay or something. Third issue There’s not real instruction going on. Just copy and hope I’m doing it right. Fourth issue. No pose change indicator Lastly if you’re going to let the user move around, let them rotate themselves using the controller to get them self in a better position to see the silent instructors","I've used the app twice day since purchasing it about a week ago. I Sorta like working out with Woody. One suggestion. It would be nice to have an image of the position that follows my line of sight. If my head is pointed down to the mat or bent up towards the sky, I can’t see the instructor. So, if there is a way to pose in the correct position AND see the instructor, that would be cool. I am new to yoga so I can’t really comment on the routines."
