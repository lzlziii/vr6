This is exactly what I was looking for, just pure archery with targets and multiplayer and regular bow models without any futurismüëç. It just requires graphics boost as currently it too basic, MQ2 can maintain much better graphics. And obviously need more maps for single player. Thank you!","I really like the controls,i can even pull the string to my cheek and doesnt seem to lose tracking like in other archery games but theres not much content when playing on my own.there needs to be more single player challenges and options,even bots for the arena mode especially as i cant find anyone online.this could be great with some updates"
