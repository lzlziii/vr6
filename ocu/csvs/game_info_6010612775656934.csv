Very good and creative weapons, like the laser pencil and the earth hammer. Maybe it could add a bit more mps and celestials but is good too now! Definitely worth trying. 5 stars","For the amount of time and effort of creating, testing, and releasing this game is crazy. To start things off, this game is literally free for anyone to play! So if you‚Äôre looking for a new free engaging game, you should really this out! Coming from someone who has had virtual reality for almost 3 years, this one of my overall favorite games that i own! I know that if this game get enough recognition, it could build a really big community. To conclude, this game might not be for everyone who play it, but if you are reading this review, I 100% recommend for you to at least check out the game! Overall 10/10 üëçüèø","After playing for many hours I can say with confidence that this game is worth the time I have played. There are no major problems with the game. It runs smooth, plays incredible, and is overall a well made game. There are only two problems I found. The first being that after you get the first celestial for free, it is almost impossible to get the second one without having to spend money. I am not saying this is a bad thing because it is nice to have a game to grind, but after playing since Easter I still don't have even half the amount I need. The second problem is there isn't many limited time events. In some cases it would be nice to have limited items that only people who played then could get. Over game is close to perfect and is definitely a game I don't regret downloading.","Great game all around, needs a few balancing factors here and there, maybe a few more celestials and abilities that don't just feel like spam-throwing everything as soon as it's off cooldown. Main problem I face is that I'm always facing the same person upwards of 4 times in a row due to lack of people online. I would like to see this changed. Thanks a bunch for another great free game!",It‚Äôs a very fun deck builder game where you assemble a deck of weapons and shields that you use against your opponents to win. With every single weapon and shields with its own unique Stats. The game also is very addicting where I play the game with 100% battery and goes down to 0%. This game also uses strategy to play your most effectively because if you play like me where you just use all your weapons and ability all at ones your gonna loss if your opponent you fight against haves a very strong and effective strategy. Also every hero or class have 2 special abilities that you can only use with that character.
