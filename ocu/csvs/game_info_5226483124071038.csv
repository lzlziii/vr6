I like the idea of being transported to a church setting and the options for Bible reading, service and prayer/meditation. It has a great start with the basics. One big distraction, In all cases where you are read to or hear a service, its delivered by a electronic narrator. It's not bad but noticeable. I have so many thoughts about what id like to have in here and I say that in a good way. I want this app to be successful and I look forward to seeing more! I'll jump into the Discord and offer my suggestions.","This is such a great app! I tried the app since it was on Sidequest, now it has two more rooms to stay in, the space and the Bible are very user friendly and helpful. I love having the Bible read when I feel I need it!","Really nice app! Great place to read, or meditate."
