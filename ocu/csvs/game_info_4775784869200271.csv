Explosive Power Tools Safety,"Explosive Power Tools Safety teaches players how to safely operate an Explosive Power Tool (EPT). Players are guided through the procedures required to correctly use an EPT to fix a wooden beam to a concrete wall. This includes the selection of an appropriate driver (nail), charge strength and EPT power setting, as well as the signage, exclusion zones and vocal warnings required when operating an EPT. Once the guided section is complete, the player’s knowledge is tested by completing the same process with no guidance. Players are given real-time feedback automatically as they progress through the assessment.

I don’t see any reason it would need to record audio so I will never allow this on any app unless it is a trusted multiplayer game such as pokerstars etc.. not single player games like this so I can’t play, it’s a shame for me the graphics looked good so for that 3 stars but yeah access to my microphone is denied.. If I can play without giving access then I will try it again and maybe give it 5 stars but for now was a waste of my time so for anyone reading this if like me you do not want to give permission to record then avoid downloading it will not work.","Very fun physics, and it's fun to experiment"
