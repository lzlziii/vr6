I was expecting more of a mindless shoot bubbles until you pop them with maybe some sort of time limit. It's more of a puzzle game like candy crush and very difficult for me. Also as a side note on the video it showed the bubbles in animal and other shapes. I haven't got far but all the levels I've done are just squares. Also the fact that you have to pick up the shooter is really annoying because I'm generally sitting down and it's always inside the couch. Also , while you can lock the shooter to your hand I'm constantly unlocking and dropping it. I see literally no reason why the shooter wouldn't be in your hand so I wish you could turn this off and have it always be locked.","Update: Thanks for getting back to me. I have tried the below, but I will try some more. 5 back, as it is indeed a 5* game! Moving my rating from 5* to 1* to get the DEVS attention (will change back afterwards) level 175 is impossible - I’ve been trying it for months, and I am good at this game. Devs, can you even complete this yourself? Please give me a tip because I’m going to have to give up and delete it. Loved playing this game. The atmosphere is lovely, with the changing areas and the gameplay is smooth and finished. The challenge scales up nicely, and I enjoyed for once not just walking my way through a game and actually having to think about how to tackle a level. I’ve completed all 125 levels, and took me a decent amount of time. I do see 5 more worlds after level 125 - that I can’t work out how to unlock (states 250 stars, but I have more than that). I assume this content doesn’t exist yet - unless the developers can confirm to me how to unlock these levels? Overall: I highly recommend this game and can’t believe it’s free. This game is definitely worth month, so I’d suggest you download it and give it a go!","I played this game to the end and I loved everything about it. I was one of the most relaxing games that I have played in a long time. I just wish that it could have gone on. I had many levels and each one got somewhat harder which was really nice. I wish..**HINT HINT** that the makers of this game would do another one...soon. I have been looking for another game similar to this one but I havent found one yet. I guess I'm going to have to replay this one again. Once again, please, please make another game like this one. Thanks bunches!","I love this kawaii game and am really addicted to it. After many callengese, finally I made it to Level175, but I'm stuck. This is sooo tough! Please give me some hints, please!","This game has a crazy number of levels, and will occupy you for hours and hours for sure. It even has a browser built in so you can listen to music while you play. There are a few things that are a bit rough around the edges: some framerate drops on certain levels, a difficulty level that really ramps up after about 35 levels or so (iirc), and a gameplay dynamic on a few levels that changes the balls back and forth... just makes for a lot of standing and waiting. At free, it's 100% worth a pickup. At $10 or $15 it would still be great value I say."
