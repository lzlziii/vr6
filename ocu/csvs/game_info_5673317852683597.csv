Or put in a option for stick turning/acceleration I could do some really cool tricks in the hoverboard park.",Quite poggy,It just glitched when I tried to load a track. Nothing worked,This is definitely one of the games of all time. It is a lot of fun just racing with friends and insulting the dev when I know it is all my fault. That's right Mini I do live in your walls. Either way I can not wait to crush your time and play this for a video! TLDR: Sub to quest taker,"Its still a demo but a very fun demo. Ive had fun trying to get the fastest times and racing around the track, very well made game with good music and fun multiplayer, if you are looking for a fun little racing game with your friends this is a good option!"
