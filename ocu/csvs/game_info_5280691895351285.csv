Fruit Attack,"Slicing fruits in VR environment can never be easier. This app is different from any other fruits cutting app. The fruits are not thrown from bottom to top. Instead the fruit will fly to you at certain speed. There will be bomb hidden behind. So you will have to be careful. Once you cut the fruits, you will get certain scores. If your score is over 500, you will proceed the next level. Otherwise, you will have to play again on this level. Each level it creates fruits and bomb. In the higher level, the fruit comes to you much faster with more bombs. It is very simple ideas. But many people find fun. Instead of exercise the finger in screen, you will exercise two hands in this game. ",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Action,English,"1.0

I also sometimes slice fruit before it's even gotten close to me. I also got a score over 500 on the second level but it didn't proceed me to a new stage so now I feel like I have no more reason to play the game. Hope the devs can give the this game the proper TLC that it needs. If I had an ideal hope for the future would also be that the fruit actually gets more thrown or lobbed at you instead of floating towards you, and I would also love if they came at variable speeds and not all at once at the same speed. 3 stars for the novelty of the idea and partial execution but realistically deserves 2 in this state.","First, thank you developers of this game, please continue to improve the game, More colorful targets to cut, more levels selections to play and more weapons selections to use if possible. Keep up the good work. Thank you",5 stars for the price !!!!Great game simple and a bit addictive family fun Graphics prettygood. Mechanics seem compliable. Simple fun way to work the arm muscles cannot go wrong for price. Try it!!!!
