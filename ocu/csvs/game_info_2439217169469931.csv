Good job.","My 8yos and 5yo really had fun taking turns playing this game. Great for casting to the TV so everyone can have join in and make suggestions. Some of the puzzles can be tricky for little ones. The graphics are simple, cartoony and perfect for this style of game. The music by Wintergarten is also perfect. I also love that they integrated hand tracking, though not all controls are available when you just have hands. I would like it if there were some more finger tracking options like thumb to middle finger for re centre view or something. But yeah, it's a great game!",Such a cute game. I love it and my 6 year old loves it.,The game give me a super relax and chilling feeling. I was so happy when I played this because everything was so cute and kinda remind me of my childhood. The only down thing was it so short and I wish it would have a second part!,"Very sweet and charming, although very short. Stick with controllers for this game, the hand tracking is too frustrating. These worlds need to be rotated and no gesture seems to work any better than 1/10 times to make it rotate."
