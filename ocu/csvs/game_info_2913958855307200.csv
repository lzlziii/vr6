Alone. Or with strangers. It’s amazing. People hate on this game for its “lack of content” when mining and making and crafting from 0 to 100 then going back to zero is just…wow. If you love being immersed in a survival world with things to do, skills to learn, and actual techniques that play into how efficient you’ll be, but this game! The lack of content UPDATES is what everyone is talking about. The games only $10. If you have the money to flesh out, and have friends to play it with, I fully recommend this game with my heart and soul. Live laugh a township tale.","This game can not be ten bucks. It so flipping GOOD. It’s so fun. Must by. 12/23/21. Game is still good just gets a bit boring after a while. I love this game, but the things there trying to put in take so long. It can be very annoying waiting for a update. The forest map also the tower still is not in last time I checked. I get it it is hard to make updates but it’s been so long and all we have got is just holiday updates and bug fixes mostly. This game is still worth buying but just lacks content. 10/27/22, wow, nothings changed. It’s still the same but the only thing they ever add is cosmetic rotation’s. The game feels abandoned and lacking new content. The only fun time I have in this game is when I’m in a private server with friends. If you are very desperate for a fun mmo rpg you should get it other then that wait and see if there even will be a major update. This is probably going to be my last update on this review, it’s been fun but sad to see this game die, this game is going to 5 stars to 2. Goodbye. 8/10/23… I was Way too hard on this game. I appreciate that they added the climbing tower and there’s still a lot of content and this game is worth the money. Get it if you enjoy RPG‘s if you’re looking for a game like Minecraft don’t get this game. and yeah this is probably going to be my final section of the review I’m probably not gonna update it anymore but it’s going to be a 5/5 it’s a really good game I think you guys should check it out bye… by the by I have so many memories in this game and thanks for everything…",I love this game That is all Stop Scrolling Down I Will ban you in your favorite server if you Dont scroll down 3 2 1 Ok Last chance Ok but can you Stop or //ban you Stop!

Brainsssss!!!!!!!! Mmmmmmm 54810oq You suck 10936wbz,"My friends and I bought this game for Thanksgiving of ‘22, and we’ve been playing it since and we’re STILL discovering new things. The developers have clearly put a lot of effort into building the game and it’s mechanics. That said, I’d definitely look up the various guides made for this game on YouTube, because the game kinda just tosses you in without explaining much. It doesn’t teach you how to make your own server, the tutorial is optional, and it only gives you the basics. The locations are vast, engaging, and honestly beautiful, (despite these graphics not really being stunning, I continuously find myself admiring the beauty of this world). Combat, crafting, exploring, and learning with a group of your friends is SO MUCH FUN. That said, I feel like this game would only be fun with friends. One little thing to note too - we *just* lost our server for some reason. The game crashed when we tried using the televator, and now we can’t reboot our world. So we’ve started a ticket with Township Tale’s tech support. So hopefully we didn’t lose the last year’s progress 🙃","let’s start this off by saying this game is in my top 5 vr games ever. Gameplay is phenomenal. Graphics are not the greatest but just where it needs to be. Community is full of toxic 7 year olds, but if u find good people they will teach you everything you need to know. which is good because this game is confusing for beginners. I think the game really shines if u have a couple of friends on a private server with you. it really shows you the potential and gives you the pride of expanding your town. Overall, 10/10"
