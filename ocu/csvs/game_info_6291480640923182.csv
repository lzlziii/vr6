Loam Sandbox,"Welcome to the magical world of Loam Sandbox, a garden sim game where it’s always Springtime and you have the creative liberty to develop the garden you’ve always dreamed of having! As you step inside, you’ll receive your very own garden plot and the ultimate freedom to design it to your liking. Bring life to your new land by growing plants and placing décor—who knows, you might even attract a few critters while you’re at it. Harvest and sell crops using the communications console located on the front porch to earn Solstice that you can use to buy new seeds and decorations for your garden. Design a space to relax in and enjoy.

You can grow a large selection of flowers, plants, veggies and fruit. You also get to pick and place your décor where ever you want. Nice bench under a shady tree. The game has multiple movement methods, making the game immersive and fun for everyone. The controls are nice, and easy to use tools and interact with items. Now for the fun stuff. You get to grow and maintain your gardens. Doing this will give you a crop to harvest and sell in your amazing tool shed. Selling the crop will allow you to use the online catalog to purchase all sorts of décor and different seeds to grow. Now its time to start designing your backyard. It is so much fun planning out where you will grow and place things. Nothing is permanent though. You can scarp parts of your yard, or the whole thing and start things over at any time. Designing your yard and watching it develop is an absolute charm. The more you design your yard, the more you will get visitors from random wild life. You end the day by going to bed, that's when the magic happens. You will wake up and have your morning routine of maintenance to perform, and also get to see the wonders you have grown. Little secret, flip to the back of the gardening manual, and see how long things take to grow. Start with fast growing plants, so you will have something to harvest every other day and make money quickly. This is one of the better gardening sims I have played, and have spent hours in the game making changes to my garden without noticing. Its just such a relaxing immersive game. One thing its missing is a pet. You would get to select a cat or dog as your pet, and it would always be in your garden waiting for you. If you are into sandbox games, gardening and relaxation, this is a VR title you don't want to miss. Watch my preview here, https://youtu.be/7IzRTBYg2Fo",I am enjoying exploring this space! You collect things you find and can cultivate your own plants. The music is really relaxing. I like the mechanics of taking my backpack off to store my treasures. Loam is a fun game for someone like me who is fairly new to VR and wants a safe space to explore!
