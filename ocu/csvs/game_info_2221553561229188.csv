Drunkn Bar Fight,"Drunkn Bar Fight is a simple, immersive, silly, rowdy game. Get into fights and use anything and everything around you to create as much chaos as you like. Why limit yourself to bars? Crash a wedding, get into back alley fights, riot a store or even a police station! Enjoy performing socially unacceptable behavior without the resulting obligatory visits to the hospital, jail and courts. The only limits to the mayhem is your imagination and your moral decency. ‚Ä¢ Now with 4 Player Co-Op! ‚Ä¢ 6 levels: bars, parties, a supermarket, a police station and the streets ‚Ä¢ More than 110 different weapons, from crowbars to nunchakus, beer bottles, tip jars, plungers, explosives and more! ‚Ä¢ Brawl with over 50 enemies including a Karen, an Incel and Open Carry Grandfather who's lost his Granddaughter and sidearm at Black Friday",16+,"Single User, Co-op","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Fighting","English, English (US), English (Australia), English (Canada), English (UK), English (South Africa)",11.00,The Munky,The Munky,https://www.themunky.com/,"Sep 12, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2221553561229188/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2221553561229188&r=1, https://www.themunky.com/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,2.06 GB,"All of the bad reviews are ppl who have never seen this game and just bought it, I watched videos on it, and it's amazing, really fun, yes the low quality Ali's are annoying, but it's literally called"" drunken bar fight"", YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE FCKING DRUNK!
