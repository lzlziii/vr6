And, curious about vertual reality, I decided to get my own head set after experiencing it a bit on one of my grandsons gear. (I find that when I tell my grandkids that I bought my own Meta Quest 2 Vr, they spark up and I become the cool grandpa!) I have always enjoyed the old fashion sports like pool and bowling. But when I saw these were things being offered in virtual reality, I was a bit skeptical. But I must say that the experience has been delightful! I didn‚Äôt expect to find the type of real game experience as I‚Äôm finding in ForeVR. And because of the great things that they have already accomplished, I feel assured that there are likely only great things ahead. To be certain, there is stuff that possibly can be improved on. But as I see it, no one builds something this well, and not have big plans ahead. There was one glitch I did notice and which I reported to them immediately. They responded back quickly and assured me that they know about it and are working it out. And I'm confident that they are! In any case, it's not just the play that excels, but the available extras. The moving around in fantastic places and the finding of fun suprises throughout the envirionments... like real video arcade games that actually work! Didn't expect that! I hope that the ForeVR folks continue to add to this type of extra sideline immersive play. I bought all four of the ForeVR games in a bundle deal.. and love them all, (except for possibly darts which it seems, as in real life, I really haven't ""yet"" got a good handle on... but will be working on it! üôÇ But I got one of my grandsons to also buy this bundle deal so we can play togethor, and what fun we have already had... and look forward to having in the future!","Hi, I love the Forever brand. I have bought all the games so far, which I find fun and very intuitive, and would definitely recommend all Forever games, but, with the exception of Forever pool. I am annoyed, because so far, the other games are very easy to use and makes sense when playing, and I was very excited when I heard about Forever Pool. However, there are a few issues I cannot get my head around, and why you would go against the approach you took with the other games (Bowling, Darts and Corn hole have realistic dimensions, action and functionality). The easiest why to describe this would be to go and take a look at another VR game which has the word ‚ÄòSparks‚Äô in its title (not sure if I say another competitor game title in this review). It is sooooo easy to use, table hight cue action, functionality, and dimensions are spot on, and intuitive like your previous games. Here are my top 3 main issues I find clunky, and just strange about Forever Pool 1) The game makes you use only the last 12 inches of the cue. This feels strange as your dominated had is a foot away from your front hand and not at the back of the cue. The other game I mentioned have you holding the cue correctly, one at front and one at back of cue. Note I checked setting and cannot see any adjustments, but please let me know if I‚Äôm wrong. 2) Why is the table unnatural low when you walk up, and then becomes the correct high when you press the controller to line up. Why not have the table the correct high all the time. This will feel more natural to the environment when playing. Other mentioned game has a natural feel when addressing the pool table or walking around. 3) Why do you use blue rectangle to navigate around the table. It would appear to make sense to just teleport like normal, or BETTER still float/glide around the table like previously mention other VR game. The rectangle functions makes the game less realistic, a little visible messy, and actually a layer of complexity. I also find it hard when trying to leave the table when in a middle of a game, I struggle to break away from the blue rectangle and switch to teleport. This maybe down to getting used to the game functionality. However, if this rectangle functionality was replaced as mentioned above, this would go away, and the game play would feel natural I really like the Forever brand and would suggest anyone buy the other games. But I find Pool clunky, less intuitive and more thought is required to play then previous Forever games, which are just pick up and play. I hate to mention it, but one last time, I suggest you look at the other game, and you will understand. Finally, not sure if you do, but do you ever road test these games while in development with the public? If not, it would be beneficial to get feed back, as I am a annoyed that this game has the above issues, because I think some, (like the rectangle and walk around) would not be feasible to change now the game is released. I will keep the game because of the brand and in game link, but will probably only play the other Forever games, unless there are modifications to the pool. It‚Äôs just an annoying shame that the functionality is not as intuitive as the other mentioned game, because I believe you would be onto yet another great game release. UPDATE: Just played again, and my still cannot understand the positioning of the hands both up front on the cue. Some shots I play like Im Playing the violin. I must be going mad, as only a few have mentioned hand positioning. And moving around and off the table is still annoying. Lastly, I would have preferred Peter griffin than Joe Swanson voice lol. UPDATE: Got used to travelling by changing to smooth locomotion. However, the hand positioning on the cue is beyond me. Some shots make you play like your playing the violin, or your dominant hand need to be on your chest. I just don‚Äôt understand why only some people are not stating this. As mentioned play SPARK BALL POOL, which is free, and your see the total difference and experience. Love Forever games, but struggle with this one. UPDATE: 13 March. Tried again since recent update and cue holding still a problem. This is the only thing stopping me playing Pool shark and switching to Forever pool, and increasing my rating to 5 stars. UPDATE: 27 April game update. Cue action still not right. Still has the back hand soooo close to the bridge hand. I am 100% sure that‚Äôs why the game rating is only 50% 5 star. Unfortunately this is one of the lowest rating game in Oculus, which is a shame as I like forever brand. I still champion Pool shark cue functionality. Kind regards",Lots of fun. Just like playing a real game of pool at a pool hall.,*edit for dev.. Im talking about when you lock onto the ball before taking a shot.. I'm fine with moving around before taking a shot :) I just don't like the complete shift in perspective when locking on with the trigger .. it's like I'm shooting from my face and it feels restrictive. Thanks The game is great but the way you lock on to a shot is so unnatural! I get ready to take a shot then when I press the lock on it all changes and I'm glued to the table. Please can there be an option to lock on where I choose to put my hand and let my head be free to move around like in real life.. I feel like this would be more natural,I am 71 and getting such a kick out of this game. I bought another one for my son who lives 9 hrs away and am looking forward to playing Forevr pool with him‚Ä¶if he can get the headset away from his 7 y/o daughter! I hope the few glitches get resolved soon!
