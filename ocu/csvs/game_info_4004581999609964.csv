Mortal and Monster,"Mortal & Monster is a challenging rogue-like action RPG developed for Quest. We are aiming to combine tower-defense battle system and rogue-like dungeon map together to make an epic single player VR dungeon adventure. Dynamic Character Build: Discover hundreds of unique weapons, skills, food, potions, wands and other items to make your own build. Full 6DOF Battle System: Each weapon has its own unique battle style, including sword&shield, claymore, bow, throwing axe. You can use 6DOF controller to input actions like block, slash, stab, two-hand cleave and so on. Random Map and Events: the dungeon map is generated randomly. Each room contains different events like combat encounters, trap, merchant, bonfire, alter, mini card game and so on. Every time you begin your journey in the dark dungeon, the layout differs which is displayed in map.

Awesome atmosfere and immersion. Nice parts with torch light effects when in darkness. Need to change teleport for free movement and free roaming if want to be considered a Roguelike. Need to cancel on rails as told previously. With these changes it will be a really decent dungeoneer and I will give you 5 stars.,"This game definitely has potential, but you had me at rogue like style. Probably my favorite kind of game these days. However; this game is completely on rails, which was a instant turn off for me. I feel if your game is going to be a rogue like game. Take away the rails. Definitely not a fan of games on rails. Drop Dead was great, but not something I play to often. If you fixed it and made it full locomotion I may check it out again."
