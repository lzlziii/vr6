A very promising app built with attention to functionality, user needs ,and networking . Looking forward to enjoying the app as it's beyond kg built. Great job and thank you !","I was very amazed to hear that one guy alone created this app for all of us. While the interface looks simplistic and it's in the first steps, it holds great potential. I can't wait to see the youtube screens for my friends to do karaokes and meetings. It has so far been the place to go when my other apps crash because it remains solid in it's simplicity. I love that it holds better textures and images than Horizon. Hopefully in the future it will be as great as Altspace (Please don't sell it to Microsoft when it does).","With the closing of alt space, getting closer, I have been looking at all the different platforms. Each one gave me anxiety. They were either not user-friendly, I have annoying kids, running everywhere, or they had way too many glitches for my liking. So I was hesitant on checking this place out. Boy was I surprised! I was immediately surrounded by family and friends. I even made some new friends. We talked and laughed and enjoyed visiting the different worlds. It was relaxing and is very easy to use. I have found my new home. The updates are frequent and there is so much more potential making this social platform. The one everyone is going to want to be on. You really need to stop by and see for yourself. I can’t wait to see what the future holds here.","With the closing of Altspace nearing I have been looking for a new platform to hang out with old friends and to make new ones. This platform,although still in its beginning phases, is going to go places and quick! The members of the team that I have met so far are creative and very helpful! I definitely felt like I was “home” and I urge anyone to come check out what Let’s Connect VR has to offer!","Even in its infancy, this app shows great strides towards creating a great meta community. In these days of social isolation, this app is giving you the opportunity to grow with others and have a safe space of like-minded individuals. The interface is simple and easy to learn. Ther"
