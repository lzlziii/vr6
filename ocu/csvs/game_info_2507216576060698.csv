Star Trek: Bridge Crew,"Star Trek™: Bridge Crew will immerse you in the Star Trek universe thanks to VR. The game puts you and your friends in the heart of the U.S.S. Aegis. Your mission: explore a largely uncharted sector of space known as The Trench, in hopes of locating a suitable new home world for the decimated Vulcan populace. The Klingon Empire is also active in the region, and their purpose is a threat to the Federation’s plans. Make strategic decisions and coordinate actions with your crew to complete the mission. In co-op, you can form a crew of four players to serve in the roles of Captain, Helm, Tactical and Engineer. In addition to a dynamic storyline, the game features an “Ongoing Missions” mode, procedurally generating missions for countless hours of Solo and Co-op adventure. Uplay account required. A permanent internet connection is required in order to play the game.",7+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Simulation, Social","English, French (France), German",1.0,Force Field Entertainment B.V.,Oculus,http://www.startrekbridgecrew.com/,"Dec 16, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2507216576060698/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=2507216576060698&r=1, https://legal.ubi.com/privacypolicy/en-INTL",Terms of Service,1.56 GB,"To play this game, you must create an account with Ubisoft and link it with your Meta account. I have been attempting to do that since I was gifted this game in November 2022. Ubisoft support does not exist, and their published instructions keep you circling with no resolution or satisfaction. So, I suggest not buying or gifting this game. I hope that my gifter is able to get a refund. I have Uninstalled it and will definitely avoid Ubisoft products in the future. It is difficult to believe that Ubisoft and Meta have made this linking set-up so difficult to achieve.",I don’t know why Ubisoft making this weird glitches or bugs. But everyone has problems about it. Some of the players can’t even hear me. Some of them do. Ubisoft never even updated this better. Is Ubisoft being lazy? Or not? Cuz this is way out of control of this… bugs!,"This game has so much promise and a group of fans that would gladly spend the money to play it. There are new ships, storylines and more that fans would drool over if given an upgrade. The game needs some repair work, because obviously the secondary back ups have failed. Difficult to connect to others and definitely has some glitches. Give us updates, new ships and stories and we’ll build a cult following.","This game is as close as you can get to serving in a Star Fleet bridge. It has so much potential, but K think the developers have pushed it to the side. Pros: Excellent design and graphics Great storyline Excellent with both a real crew and AI crew. Fun!! You feel the part you play in the bridge-good community as well. Cons: Recurring glitches with sounds in multiplayer mode. Sometimes it’s me, sometimes others. Controls lock up 30% of the time in multiplayer mode. WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS DEVELOPED MORE. Maybe a Klingon Bridge? Romulan? More storylines? The possibilities are endless with this game!","It took a bunch of tries to get this game working, and I understand the other people giving poor reviews saying it's broken, but it does indeed work, and I got into some great missions with very fun people easily once I got through the struggle to get it going. So, people are playing still, and it's worth the wait. Love it love it love it! Engage!"
