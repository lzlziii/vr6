Get a guide (as you'll likely need one). This takes you back to a time when people paid for guides to games (or before then?) But remimagined in a beautiful VR world. Don't sleep on this gem! b i t , l y / C C a v e",I like caves and I like exploring so I like this game. At least 4 stars. Negative reviews are mostly based on issues that no longer exist. I can get motion sickness but I didn’t in this game and i used classic movement and made the speed faster. You learn the game by playing and learn from your mistakes. I did make one mistake that rendered the game unfinishable. Now I know for next time. At least I still got to see everything. The biggest tip may be to save often and save multiple slots. $40 is definitely too much for the length. Got it on sale for $20 which is much more reasonable. The only thing I didn’t like were the mazes. Witt’s End makes no sense. DO NOT enter unless you need batteries and look up the route to get in and out online.,"I was excited to have one of my first games ever played reimagined for VR. I bought the game as soon as I saw it was available. Unfortunately, I can't play for more than 5 minutes before I have to take the headset off due to the extreme nausea the movement causes! I have found that games with teleport style movement don't affect me as much as that smooth glide that Colossal Cave has. I love that the game seems to have maintained the original style. I like the narrator and enjoyed the graphics while I was standing still. I am going to request a refund. I hope if a fix to the movement is found that allows players like me, that are prone to dizziness in VR, to play comfortably. If a fix is made, will someone message me? I will re-purchase the game in a heartbeat.","What a trip down memory lane from the Willie Crowther original! Once the teleport mode was implemented so I could get over the nausea, I loved this. Any chance you’ll tackle Zork next?","Unintuitive controls, Terrible navigation. Fascinating cave but Solutions to puzzles are illogical. Random dwarf randomly killed me with no chance to defend myself. Then was back at the house. Nope. I’m out. On to the next game. Save your money."
