And even though it does make me sad, this game holds a special place in my heart. THANK YOU SO MUCH CREATORSðŸ¥¹","The game is absolutely amazing, some parts of the game are simply BEAUTIFUL. my only problem with the game is that after you finish the story, you can't go back to make sure you got everything, that you upgraded all your weapons to full. The game also needs more content, as it felt kind of.... empty. I would either make a sequel to the game or add a dlc or two. Doesn't feel like it's worth 30 bucks, more something like 15-20 bucks instead","Hi, so first off let's talk about pros Pros â€¢It looks beautiful as to be expected â€¢Get thrown in immediately and left to explore Controls are pretty simple You feel pretty cool â€¢Left to solve puzzles without help feeling smarter. â€¢Dying isn't punished too hard and trust me you will. â€¢Power ups and upgrades look cool, and make you feel cool most of the time. â€¢many interesting ideas and concepts are thrown into the game making it not feel repetitive. Alright cons â€¢Literally almost no instructions, you learn the basic jist of things and then left wondering what to do which can be fine but is terrifying when your fighting a boss which leads to later problems â€¢Key mechanics aren't explained like the shield breaking, that was scary, and led to me dying twice because I didn't know that. You're taught how to use the shield and even that you can reflect certain projectiles towards enemy's but not that your shield will break. â€¢There is no replayability besides starting the game over. When you have beaten a level, you beat it, and it can never be able to play it again. This sucks when it comes to you missing an item. I literally saw a crucial item I needed behind me and I could not get it later in the game so when it came to it I wasn't as well prepared for the boss fight as I could have been which made it more annoying. â€¢You get no hints while fighting a monster, you get no idea how to start doing damage to some monsters, or what you need to do to get to it's second phase, nor does it show clearly that oh this projectile or attack can't be shielded. â€¢You can't jump, I cannot tell you how many times jumping would have saved my life. In conclusion while yes it is fun being kinda thrown in to learn for yourself it is almost completely that with some game mechanics explained but not to the fullest detail. There were something's I liked learning on my own, there were other times I was scared and thought the game was broken but it wasn't I just was very ill informed, heck I didn't know you could shoot some forms of projectiles. While this game is beautiful and I enjoyed getting some of the collectables and power ups were amazing and I truly did enjoy them. However not being able to go back at all in the game stinks, whence you have made movements forward you cannot go backwards not even dying will allow you to go back, save points in this case feel more hindering. And again while being thrown in is fine being left absolutely clueless is stressful, you get taught almost the bare minimum, some of the puzzles become really fun, however figuring out others becomes really annoying. For the first boss it's sort of clear what to aim for, but that second boss was so hard because I didn't know I was aiming to hit the wrong part. Some fixes. Give player the ability to jump, allow levels to be replayed. And while still don't need to tell it to us to make it obvious, showing something's to be more obvious or more ways to use something would be appreciated. I'd still recommend this game because it's a mostly fun experience but it definitely isn't perfect.","This is one of the, if not the best combat/story/puzzle games I have ever found on the quest 2. Journey of the gods has amazing graphics, combat styles and story. This game has smooth locomotion and easy movement, very friendly for players who suffer from motion sickness. It has very easygoing game progression that adds onto your understanding and love for the game. It also has a free demo that maybe shows you 1/7 of the full game that you should download if you arenâ€™t quite sure you want to spend the money. Highly recommend, extraordinarily fun, love this.","I expected this game to have a lot more content and have more story and the bosses are nice but the levels between are just annoying, personally I believe itâ€™s not worth 30$ I requested a refund but it was denied."
