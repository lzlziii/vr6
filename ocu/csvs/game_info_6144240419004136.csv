Ask for a little less recoil? Boom, a week or 2 later an update addresses that very issue‚Ä¶ More gun options? Boom, done. Add ability to upgrade weapons? Boom, done. EVERYTHING I‚Äôve asked for has either already been implemented or I‚Äôve been given a legit reason for why my idea isn‚Äôt possible or not very well thought out. I badly want to see the this game succeed not only because the game merits serious recognition, but because this developer is a paragon of customer service. Please give this game a shot. I bought it at This game is sooooo close to being a 5 star banger, but a couple of tweaks are necessary. First, most of the firearms have way too much recoil which makes it dang near impossible to hit what you‚Äôre aiming at. I‚Äôm a shooter in a real life as well as experienced in VR shooting so I have an idea how it should feel‚Ä¶as soon as you pull the trigger on the full auto guns, the gun pulls up violently, making the next 4-5 bullets miss by a wide margin. I understand realism isn‚Äôt the goal, and it‚Äôs supposed to be more arcadey, but it just needs to be toned down a bit in that area. Fix this one issue, and I‚Äôll immediately update my score to 5 STARS The following is icing on the cake, but would help Strike Back stand above the rest. ‚Äî‚Äî we need more upgrades to earn, especially permanent ones like special sights, barrels, magazine extender, overall power, etc. The more upgrades you offer, the more replayable it becomes. ‚Äî‚Äî I hate saying it because EVERYONE says it about EVERY FPS, buuuuut, more firearms would be greatly appreciated lol. Custom loadouts before each round allowing the player to choose which assault rifle/sniper rifle/pistol/etc will be offered in the upcoming run‚Ä¶ for example, everyone starts with that beginner pistol but we should be able to upgrade that pistol a bunch to make it more impactful, or given the option of choosing between 7-8 other pistols, like the magnum or M9. Again, more firearms = more replayabilty. ‚Äî- Achievements/Goals for each level. For instance, an achievement/reward for 5 consecutive headshots, or win round using only a pistol‚Ä¶ ‚Äî- Finally, my biggest gripe other than the recoil is the PVP mode. I tried for 10 mins and nada. If there‚Äôs no one in the lobby, at least make it so we can play against BOTS. I have yet to try the PVP mode because nobody owns the game yet. Just about all PvP shooters offer BOTS. And if I could offer some friendly, but unsolicited advice: If you want to increase the player base, you really should consider lowering the price to around $12-$20. $30 for a brand new AppLab game with 5 reviews is big ask and most people don‚Äôt wanna chance it. Whatever you do, please don‚Äôt stop improving this game. I promise, this WILL be a top selling game in 6 months time with just a few tweaks and additions. It‚Äôs a truly unique gaming experience. Final score: 4.3 out of 5 5 out of 5 as soon as recoil issue fixed ****************************************************** REVIEW UPDATE (august 18, 2023) I can‚Äôt say enough positive things about this game and developer‚Ä¶ not only does the developer constantly keep in contact by notifying me of updates & asking for constructive criticism, but he actually LISTENS, TWEAKS, THEN IMPLEMENTS those new ideas at the speed of light.

I bought this game when it was $30 and I‚Äôll be honest, while it might have been more expensive than most, it was worth the admission price‚Ä¶. But the price has been dropped to $15, which my goodness, is an absolute STEAL!! Trust me, there‚Äôs a ton of content in Strike Back, and there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll finish in 1 or 2 sittings. It‚Äôs tough, it‚Äôs long, and it just keeps getting better‚Ä¶. What more could a gamer ask? And by the way, apparently a MAJOR update is in the pipeline which will add a ZOMBIE MODE üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç Trust me, this game is gonna be something REAL SPECIAL, REAL SOON. ******************************************************",Great game! FPS blasting at waves of enemies from cover points which you can teleport to. The way the enemies attack is a refreshing twist on wave shooters(I say this term loosely). They are more intentional and seem to communicate with each other which gives it a bit of excitement. Random weapons pop up during gameplay which you get to choose from rather than a load out at the beginning. At first I didn‚Äôt like that set up but it makes each level more interesting. I havnt had any luck joining any multiplayer but I do have high hopes once I figure it out! The recoil is pretty crazy on most of the guns but it ads difficulty especially since your usually shooting at enemies that are pretty close so I actually like it! The tutorial could use a little more info as it took some trial and error to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. I have a broken foot and have had to play seated which I didn‚Äôt think was going to work well but I adjusted player height in settings and boom I was good to go though a crouch button would be nice playing seated. It‚Äôs meant to play standing so I don‚Äôt hold any of that against it haha. This will be much more fun once I am healed up though and can definitely be played seated if you need to.,"Video review: https://youtu.be/gy-JZ3HvP94 Strike Back is an adrenaline-pumping cover shooter VR game that demands precision, tactical prowess, and physical fitness. As I immersed myself in this gripping experience, I soon realized it was much more than just a game. Hours of intense gameplay in this virtual reality realm resulted in a calorie-burning spree that surpassed what I had achieved throughout an entire week. The gunplay is nothing short of electrifying, delivering a powerful and satisfying punch with each shot. As you progress through the levels, you unlock an array of weapons, keeping the excitement fresh and engaging. An element of unpredictability adds to the thrill as weapons drop randomly after each wave, making resource management and sharpshooting skills vital to your triumph. Prepare to face cunning adversaries who relentlessly close in on your position, utilizing group tactics and grenades to dislodge you from cover. On a side note, the machine gun feels like it shoots in slow motion, probably due to the muzzle flash animation. This felt odd. Furthermore, in certain situations, the 3D model of the weapon intersects with the cover, leading to awkward scenarios. Make sure you play in a room with enough space to be a bit further behind it. Overall, an amazing and very challenging shooter that will definitely not just make you have fun playing, but also get you some exercise. Highly recommended.","Nice arcade style shooter, some great levels and it‚Äôs not easy which is good. I feel the grenades should be moved as I‚Äôve set them off so many times with my non dominate hand when gripping the guns. Apart from that so far so good! Impressive. If you need a code for this game shoot me a message üòé Or check my bio üëá b√Æo.l√Ænk/tomgunnagetya Just replace the √Æ with i","cool gun game, not moving around feeling sick! you are standing in 1 space and can dodge bullets by moving left or right. quite strategic on what weapon to choose on each stage as i noticed this whilst trying to pass the first level."
