Experience the exhilarating pleasure of fishing in Real VR Fishing. I always recommend this game to anyone new to VR. Even people who are not interested in fishing can enjoy the moment of catching fish while relaxing in this game. Basically, it provides various landscapes of Korea, and various landscapes of the United States and Japan can also be purchased as DLC. If you look at the scenery quietly, you will soon notice that you have forgotten your worries, relaxed and feel at ease. Was this helpful? If so, Please mark review as helpful","Love this game but there‚Äôs some problems This will not be review where I talk trash about this I‚Äôm just giving suggestions to make some updates such as catching bass you could add more lures, such as chatter bait make bass like spinners worms, because they actually like those in real life","I found out that in order to be seen you must be in oculus join before you can join in the fish again to be seen,, If you try to send an invite straight from the fishing game the person you invited won't be able to see you So you have to go to oculus first first and then join the fishing game.",Although fishing is fun but I always wanted to go ice fishing but can't so can they add ice fishing to the game please! If ice fishing was added I would play this game everyday but now I play 3 times a week. I think that ice fishing will make this game a lot bigger and better for others that play,This game has become my main reason for using my vr anymore. It's well worth the money and I've got no buyers remorse after like some other games. I can't tell you how many times I moved my virtual fishing rod around my actual surroundings. It's that immersive. Problem with that is I ran through the levels pretty quick and once maxed out I have to wait for a new DL. The feedback from the controllers make it where you think you can feel the line but I was hoping the devs could add where when you cast you can pull the trigger to slow the line and stop it like irl if you cast too far out. Might add some sort of side game for precision placement that'd challenge us once we max out and catch all the fish. But if I could at least stop the cast I'd be thrilled. Best game overall IMO and the only one I still play regularly. Well done devs.
