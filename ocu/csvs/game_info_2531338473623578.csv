Spaceteam VR,"A chaotic co-op party shouting game. Things might get heated but always work together as a Spaceteam! The ship's computer is out of control, your only chance of surviving longer than one sector is to shout technobabble at your friends! Try to follow the randomly generated, incorrectly assigned, sometimes impossible to pronounce instructions and steer your ship out of the path of a supernova. Complete enough instructions successfully and you will progress to the next sector, each more difficult and so the ship becomes harder to control. Dodge asteroids by shaking your maracas, clean up alien goop and disco dance like your life depends on it! Ways to play: VR MULTIPLAYER Up to 6 players, in any popular VR headset join in a co-op game trying to avoid their inevitable doom. FACE TO FACE Up to 6 players with at least 1 headset and connected smart devices, this feels much like the original Spaceteam game. SINGLE PLAYER In Practice Mode your Spaceteam will be 2 of our trusty robots!",7+,"Multiplayer, Single User, Co-op","Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Social",English,1.1.5005,Cooperative Innovations,Cooperative Innovations,http://spaceteamvr.com/,"May 21, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2531338473623578/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=2531338473623578&r=1, https://www.coopinnovations.co.uk/privacy/",Terms of Service,741.1 MB,I honestly think more people should be playing this. It‚Äôs a fun game to play with other people in the same room and I think multiplayer will also be fun as well. Hopefully this game gets marketed somehow and gets players.,"We used to play this game a few years back on our phones, and we loved it! This on the other hand doesn't load. Such a shame, and waste of money. üôÅ",This game is a blast when you get going but the servers are super unreliable running the experience. Nothing sucks more than getting through half a dozen nail biting levels just to have all the phone players drop out. If you click play again at the end of a game the phone players don‚Äôt come along. If they vr players don‚Äôt join before the phone players they end up stacking on top of each other and can‚Äôt see the screens anymore. The game is just so glitchy and the servers are so bad its really frustrating. Can‚Äôt recommend at all.,"I play the game and there‚Äôs literally no one on, no servers no nothing. But the reviews are saying they played with people.","The first problem is that the web stvr.app is not working correctly. We have tried to insert the code in the text box with two smartphones and one tablet (Samsung and Xiaomi) and the device keyboard appear and disappear. The only way to insert the codes was to write in another application and making a copy/paste of it. But when a game finished, never it works to restart it, always we have to create another game, and we had to insert all the codes again and again. The second problem, we are not an english speakers, but it does not matter because only we have to repeat (more or less) the commands and search them in our controls. But, in the fourth or fifth sector (in easy mode), the commands appear with underlines instead of many letters, and then it was impossible to us to deduce de correct words. I don't understand that a game which mobile version is translated to another languages it does not use those translations to include in the VR game. In resume, a good idea bad implemented."
