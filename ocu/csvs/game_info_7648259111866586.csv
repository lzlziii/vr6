Bayou Beach XR,"Bayou is a beautiful social island where you can enjoy live music, play volleyball, watch the stars or ride the rollercoaster. Do it alone, invite your friends or meet new people! Customize your avatar, enter your name and fly to the most peaceful island you’ve ever seen! Walk or teleport around to find other people who are enjoying the sun and join them on a short trip to the volleyball area. If you feel too hot at any moment, take a dive in the sea and enjoy being under water without having to hold your breath. Don’t skip out on the nightwatch area, where you can get comfortable, lie on your back and look at thousands of stars without any light pollution! Can you find your star sign? If at any time you feel like your current look no longer represents you, you can go back in the booth and change the way you look, or even your name! See you on Bayou!",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Music Video, Relaxation/Meditation, Social",English,1.0.0.21,VRROOM,The I Love Company BV,https://www.vrroom.nl/,"Feb 22, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/7648259111866586/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=7648259111866586&r=1, https://game.drumbeatsvr.com/BayouXR-privacy.txt",1.08 GB,"Looks alright.
