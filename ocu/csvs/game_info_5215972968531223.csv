VRNOID Demo,"Your goal is to destroy all bricks and enemies. Collect dropped power-ups but make sure not to miss a ball. Swing your hand to hit the ball just like in Air Hockey. Enemies are trying to shoot your VR head, which takes the challenge to a new level. Dodge bullets or reflect them into the enemy. Features: Advanced boss fights: Some bosses are weak at the back, others can't be hit by the ball, etc. Each boss requires a unique approach to defeat it. In-game level editor Try out your ideas. Full VR, no need to leave the game or use a mouse. Air Hockey: additional game mode with few setups and exciting power-ups. Flexible difficulty: 8 gameplay modifiers and 5 game difficulties are available. Play in your own style. Quick room setup: mega easy to calibrate room. Just hold one button to set direction and table height.

I've been curious how that concept could be applied to VR and this demo satisfies that curiosity. I think with some polishing up this could be very popular. Things like the shading and lighting could be improved, maybe more bright neon colors for eye candy. I will probably buy the full game after I play the demo some more, though. I worked up a little bit of a sweat after playing for about 20 minutes. Would love to be able to use both hands somehow. One note: On stage 2 of Unbreakable, when the ball was small, it managed to squeeze into the back area and got stuck there bouncing around endlessly. Then I tried to reflect the tower's bullets to destroy it but when I managed to get a direct hit, there was no damage happening. I had to restart the level after 3 or 4 minutes. Next try took me 30 seconds or so.",Very addictive and fun game and now at a lower price too! Just buy it.,I was browsing and came across this demo. It's a VR combo of Araknoid and Air Hockey. The teaser video looked interesting and I gave it a try. Well done across the board. And did I say it was a lot of fun? How about addicting?,"This is such a fun idea and it plays really really well. Not only is there a air hockey/breakout hybrid, which is superb on its own, but there's a air hockey only game with powerups! This can't be released quick enough!!!",This game is so much fun well I mean demo so please make this 58 year old Grandma happy by releasing this as a playable game to buy!! ðŸ‘Œ
