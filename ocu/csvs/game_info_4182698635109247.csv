I would be satisfied with that, but improved graphics would make it more pleasurable.","I love this game. The bot that you practice with is sometimes funny to watch. It sometimes twists and contorts to reach the ball. Also, as long as it can reach the ball, the bot will hit the ball back, even if you hit it out and sometimes even if the ball bounces off the bleachers! This provides some long volleys which, as someone in their late fifties, is exactly what I'm looking for as exercise. You can practice at hitting targets, practice with a machine, or practice against the bot. As of this writing, you cannot play an official tennis match. The developers may have abandoned this game. But I enjoy it as it is and it is certainly worth the free download, although I would pay for it.","Best sport game in library, add also these VR Hockey Reborn All-in-one Sports VR Blacktop Hoops - VR Basketball The thrill of the fight (For climbing Blade&Sorcery is better than The climb really lol)",The graphic is very good but it lags to much,It’s good in all but I think it could be better
