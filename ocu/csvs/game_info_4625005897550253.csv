Cybrix,"Play the racket game from the future in your living room today! Are you ready to break a sweat in this ball bouncing, brick smashing madness? Can you destroy every single brick by swinging the rackets, shooting laser guns and detonating explosive balls, all while dodging shrapnel, charging up the piercing ball and collecting power-ups? Compete against your friends on the global leaderboard in 50 different levels or try to get as far as you can in the endless mode (sweat towels are sold separately)! Can you smash them all?",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Arcade, Sports",English,0.9.16,Holonautic,Holonautic,https://www.holonautic.com/cybrix,"Nov 10, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4625005897550253/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4625005897550253&r=1, https://www.holonautic.com/privacy-policies/privacy-policy",603.5 MB,"I get more exercise than any other game. There is no fear of getting shot by enemies, just the addictive joy of smashing! Wish I tried it earlier than I did. Love it. No complaints, except for my sore arms",surprised this never made it out of the app lab. one of the best games on meta quest,"Really enjoyed this game, good workout too, it should be on the main store !","A fun game that will have you exercising without realizing it. Fun retro style Arkanoid (breakout with special weapon options) meets racquetball gameplay. Unlike some other tennis inspired games this one puts a racquet in both hands, instead of having to choose right hand/ left hand options. It starts out simple, then the paces gets more and more frantic as the game progresses. Addictive, fun and a good workout. - what more do you need?","This one is great for exercise (on hard or extreme) that can be played over and over again without getting boring. If you want an extra challenge and have enough room, stand on a step stool when you “calibrate height” in the game menu and it will make the court larger to where you really have to jump and lunge for the ball! Just a fantastic game!"
