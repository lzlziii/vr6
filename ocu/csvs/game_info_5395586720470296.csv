This is the type of title you expect Meta to start shipping along with their headsets just to demo how solid their OWN technology is. The controls feel fluid and will have you holding your hand in front of your fridge waiting for it to open after you take the headset off. The game stays faithful to the roguelike genre in all ways. Levels are all procedurally generated, with skills, powerups, traps, and an arsenal of weapons. This game is clearly intended to be played with your hands, and everything in the design reflects that premise. The music is incredible. It's hard to comment on this game and not make any reference to the incredible soundtrack. I love the style and aesthetics of the game. New Game Plus, Plenty of gamemodes, and unlockable classes keep the game fresh, with a leaderboard to compete the whole way.","I love rogue like games. I was hesitant about this game due to it being a hand tracking game. If you are in both categories, I suggest you give this a shot! Really unique and I love how you move around. It’s really amazing what this developer has accomplished. It’s great fun moving through the areas and taking out the enemies. Upgrades are great as well. Don’t sleep on this one!","With hand tracking 2.0 this is the BEST hand tracking game on quest 2! The combat is super fun and fluent, the graphics are AMAZING and the enemy and character design is epic! There is multiple bosses which are super fun to fight and even other game modes! Overall great game with hours of content in it! Even the story is super awesome!! 20/10 game for sure :D","11/10 game. The graphics are just some of the best I’ve seen in vr. I legit get headaches from playing this game too much. I’m not exactly easily motion sick.￼ Man, i don’t even have hand tracking 2.0 and this is still one of the best games I’ve seen. The one thing I want with it is a sandbox mode so you can practice with weapons. If that gets added, I’ll have no problems with this game. My rating: 9001/10 Whoever made this game somehow managed to squeeze the most fun I’ve had in vr into 500 megabytes. Thanks, from the player BalloonDog87.

I personally have spent hours just fighting my way to the boss. The fact there are no paywalls, DLC or other things makes this game incredible. If you find yourself with some cash you don’t need, (and have a VR headset) this is a good investment. I got it in like version 4 or something. I can’t remember but even then is was a blast. The calls kinda remind me of Metal Gear in a way","Few games use hand tracking and even fewer use it to their advantage. Rogue Ascent uses hand tracking flawlessly. It uses an intuitive and simple gesture control system and fun finger gun shooting. The graphics aren't going to blow your mind, but they are very nicely stylised. If you are looking for a game to prove that hand tracking isn't a gimmick, this is the one."
