I learnt so much from the time i had in this game with Atom Structures, Balancing Reactions and Chemical Elements. Each app you can pay for separate and learn at you own pace, having a fun game with alot of learning is a great way to experience chemistry in a new way. An excellent educational app to add to others available for any one especially if your in school.",I was able to get through all three modules in about 90 minutes. They were fun and interesting and kept me engaged the whole time. I only earned 2 stars on each one so I will have to go back in to study more and try again! I think this app would be a great resource for parents and teachers to get kids excited about chemistry. It’s definitely worth checking out if you like science!,"I really love these games. These have helped me and my students a lot. I use them in ordinary class lessons (in group work) and individual learning. Students have the ability to learn by themselves (either faster than others or by repeating previously learned knowledge). I have seen the success and pleasure of my students. So, I recommend using these games in lessons. You will see that lessons are going to be more interesting and students will acquire new knowledge easier.","I'm working as a chemistry and physics teacher in Vändra Gymnasium. At first I got a chance to try ""Reaction balancing"" VR-lesson and I fell in love at the first sight! Now I'm using all chemistry (9) and physics (7) lessons in my everyday worklife. Futuclass VR learning modules are very well structured and give students a practical opportunity to learn in a hands-on way. It is a really rewarding opportunity to enrich chemistry and physics lessons in an innovative way of learning.","Applying virtual reality to science subjects allows more to be visualized and thus the concepts are understood more quickly. More often than not the topics that might not interest the student, become very interesting in VR and the increased motivation to learn is seen in the results. There are various ways to use VR in different subjects, which helps to make mainstream education more attractive to students. The playful environment allows students to adapt quickly and to learn difficult subjects on their own more easily than with a regular textbook and workbook. It help to learning chemistry."
