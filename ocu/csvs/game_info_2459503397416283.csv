However, when I reach the phantoms, it's very difficult for me to beat because I can't use any of the other magical abilities and when I have the spears I can only hit phantoms and not the other beasts and I would be killed everytime because I couldn't hit anything but the phantoms. I'm not sure if it's just me.",Love the move ments they make you feel so cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooiooooooool I think that the spells are great but can u also add mele wepens I haven’t finished the story so there might be a mele spell Byeeeeeeeee can u press helpfull thxxxx byeeeeee,Great game. Beautiful graphics. Fun gameplay. Good story. Looking forward to playing the sequel!,I think I was all right I just wish there’s more levels and a little bit more Mile and more spells that would be really cool ￼,"I’ve sunk a good handful of hours into this game, my girlfriend has put many more, the gameplay feels solid, if not always intuitive. Sometime spells fly off in odd directions and while it does not make my girlfriend motion sick, I’m not as lucky and have to take breaks after each level. All in all, not too bad for a casual play through, but full completion may be a bit too tedious."
