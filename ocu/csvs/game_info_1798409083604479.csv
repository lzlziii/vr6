Compared to the sequel this one is a stuttering mess. (Stand-alone) seems like itâ€™s running 7-9 FPS. Barely playable. The target rings look like 16px gifs. The flight model is ok and I would assume on par with the 2nd if it ran smoothly. Devs please patch this up to modern standards in terms of FPS. At its current state it feels unfinished and should not be available on the meta store.,When I first got my oculus I got this as a fun game to play in my free time but this game keeps giving me fun moments in vr,"OK, so Iâ€™m a commercial pilot and have thousands of hours in multi engine jets. So, I obviously lean towards these types of apps â€“ â€“ but ultra wings original and 2 are loads of fun! Each airplane has different handling characteristics, and as a 70+ senior, I canâ€™t believe how much fun I am having!! (Their support is also one of the best in the business, theyâ€™ve always gotten back to me within 24 hours)ï¿¼.","I was looking forward to online play, shooting if it's not available, the different tasks, beautiful places and better planes. I've only played a few times but I was looking forward to the things I've played in the 2nds tutorial. But I need the 15$ back in order to afford it this month. I'm not sure how to request a refund. But the second is far more worth it and it's only $5 more. I got this one for $10 on sale.","I have to rewrite my initial review as I have hit several real problems trying to fly those latest model planes with my weak, ""right"" hand, which cannot be used primarily on the flight stick because of the cognitive lag between my thought and the reaction of my weaker right hand when executing the desired maneuvers, as I am a left-handed, type 1 diabetic with severe neuropathy to the right side of my whole body, and my right hand has lost most of the feeling in my index, middle and ring fingers as well as my thumb. As a result, when I have tried to do these missions, my handicap has limited my progress so badly that it has made me nauseated just thinking about playing this game! I cannot believe that developers these days still get away with creating game platforms that accommodate both hand orientations, and this drawback has seriously made me hate this game! I mean, some developers have done an excellent job at making their games flexible in accomodations for those of us gamers who are left-handed. But, for the life of me, the developers of this game refuse to accommodate us lefties. As a result, I cannot finish these latest missions and that infuriates me to no end! I mean, all that a developer would need to do is just flip the lateral controls of the plane cockpit placing the throttle control which is initially on the left side over to the right side for the left-hand orientation of the cockpit layout. In cases where the flap control is also in the cockpit layout, just switch sides for both levers, for instance, placing the flap engagement controls that are usually on the right side out with the throttle control on the initial left side as well as maybe the landing gear lever as the left hand will be in the flight stick, the right hand will need to work the landing gear. As for the rest of the dashboard, you won't have to touch too much else. Now, if you cannot do that small change I should hope that other developers do not follow your example! And next time, do not forget to tell the potential customer that your controls are not accommodating to left handed people! I would NEVER had bought this game if I had known this failing! I hope you warn us southpaws about this failure in your game layout before we plunk out our money for this game! Do so in the future so that we can avoid this disappointment! (ðŸ˜¡SMDH!ðŸ¤¬)"
