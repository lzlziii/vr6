Its very nice the style is cool music is doing his job story is cheesy but in good way like movie that you watch to relax and enjoy swinging mechanic is chef kiss i enjoyed to swinging in city and the combat is really nice so i would easily recommend it 10/10 to buy because even after finishing the game I'll just swing in city for fun,"This is by far one of the most impressive experiences on the Quest i have played so far. The swinging, the perceived freedom of dashing trough the air, the gunplay. I liked every bit of it and did not regret the money spend for a second! What really lacks is the vividness of characters and environment. Only talking heads without any interaction with NPCs is a bit lush. Also, the short game span is a bit of a bummer, but only because it‚Äôs so fun you really dont want to stop. DLC or Part2 needed asap!",Dev Request: Coop/Multiplayer Pleeeease üôè This game is awesome! The swing/boost/brake combo is ultra satisfying. If you liked Mirrors Edge then you really need to get this title. The mini games and levelling up is üíé. We would love for you to give us an update for MQ3. Not enough people know about this gem. Well done team. An absolute cult classic!,"This is the best swinging game on the quest two right now! You can swing, you can shoot and you can go U P. The upgrades are reasonably easy to get and enemies are tough, unless you exactly know their weaknesses. The tripods: land, pull the back panel off, shoot it and they are gone! No need to disable the guns or anything. You do have to time it but it's easy. For the walkers land on them and destroy the guns if needed, and just spray your pistol on them. Over all this game is a gem, but could use some human touch, like talking seeing humans instead of just getting calls",Folks this is as close as your gunna get to feeling like your freaking spider man I promise this game is so under rated and it blows me away on how good this looks. Save urself money and go to l i n k t r . e e slash mr12gage330 and check out many others too. Just Leave no spaces in that code
