Excellent movement/locomotion and gun handling/physics. Smooth, Fast, Fun, Comfortable",If they just simply add more content and get on the official store it will absolutely blow up. This games movement is better than any other mainstream FPS. Incredible.,Probably not for those prone to motion sickness since you are swinging around on a grapple most of the time. But super fast paced fun. Demo version cannot start an online multiplayer game...however a friend with paid full version can start multiplayer game with demo version players after they are partied up with them from their social menu. So demo version players can play multiplayer with friends as long as one person has paid version to start game.
