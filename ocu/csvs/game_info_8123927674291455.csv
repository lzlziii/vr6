Having a cactus fighting his way through your livingroom is extremly cool and I have found myself trying to touch the objects, not realizing they where just digital images. Even thoug you can easily play this game while sitting, I recommend to set the arena on the floor as large as possible and then sitting in it and moving around it. Hopefully we'll see more games like this in the future.","As a fan of the previous Cactus Cowboy games I was definately on board to play this AR spinoff game. It's got a very different and fun feel from your flatscreen and even VR shooters. You see your character and the enemies in your own room, like a virtual game board. You can move around and see the stages from different angle. I can only imagine this is more trippy with colour passthrough AR. The story is fun as usual and Emilios speech at the main menu is always funny. I do have some criticism, especially since this is a paid title. Firstly its shorter compared to the other games in the Cactus Cowboy games with roughly 1 hour of playtime aside from a horde mode. Secondly, the idea that the enemies could attack you as the player was very underutilized, it was not used outside of two levels. Thirdly, I would've liked if you could raise the stage height. The stage is always on the floor so you have to bend your neck if you're standing or sit down to be comfortable. I like standing as you can walk around and see the stages from different angles but your neck starts to ache as you bend it. Raising the height would make both sitting and standing comfortable ways to play. Overall I would definately like to see a more developed, longer sequel with more AR features like being able to help Emilio by throwing bombs at the enemies. I would reccomend this game, the price is right for a shorter title and it's worth the price to experiance a proper AR game.","I love the Cactus Cowboy series and this is no exception! This is a fun platformer/shooter that can be scaled to the size of your play area. You can use the passthrough as a backdrop or turn on a VR backdrop. The passthrough started with a green tinit (of course!) but can be changed. I haven't tried the horde mode that unlocks after the story line, I will update my review once I do. It's time to stop reading and jump in and help Emilio shoot some bugs!",Really really fun game short and sweet,The saga continues!
