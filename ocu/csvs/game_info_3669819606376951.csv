The ability to throw discs in my own house was exactly what I imagined playing in VR. I will say, make sure you have plenty of space. I smashed my hand into the closet multiple times doing big throws and actually knocked the closet door off its hinges twice! The game is fairly short but very challenging and I went back to play some courses again to get more stars. Some courses have a sweet spot to throw to and get a lower throw count and it can be fun trying to find those sweet spots to land your throws. Judging the force and distance is challenging too as if you throw it too far it will fall off. Ledge then regenerate in your hand and you lose a stroke. While it isn't perfect it is still fun and probably the closest to playing disc golf of any game I've ever played, which is still great since you can play it inside on a cold snowy day when it's -1 outside :)",amazing graphcs intriguing game amazing gameplay and thrilling sights definitely recommend,I play disc golf with my buddies sometimes and this is a super cool version of that
