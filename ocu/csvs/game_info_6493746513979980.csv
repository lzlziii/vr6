First, the shotguns range is dumb, it doesn't go far at all and even when you're close to an enemy there's a chance it won't even hit. Secondly, when you take damage and the screen goes black is downright stupid, the idea is cool, but when you're taking damage rapidly and you're trying to run away but your entire screen is black and you can't see where something might hit you. Finally, the enemy's with shooters need to be nerfed, they're way to rapid and fast especially with the damage they deal.","Honestly this game is amazing, the movement, the combat, the grappling gun, even simpily bouncing off a enemy or sweeping them to the floor feels great. There’s a lot of action going on. To swinging off of giant floating skulls or simpily using your shotguns to launch yourself into the air. This is gotten me more into vr as a whole. And the price is worth it",this game is more then perfect you kill skeletons and flying skulls and its not easy which makes it more fun also i think there should be a shop for more range less time to reload and other guns like ar’s etc,I got this game after i saw it on tiktok it looked so fun so i went to download it and i didn't think it be this good since it's in app lab but now that i have played it this game is really good and they are developing more levels and other stuff i would get now for 5$ this GAME IS SUPER GOOD I DO RECOMMEND,"I'm not usually one for ""gorilla tag movement"" style games, but this one... This one is different i love the retro style graphics, and the grappling feels great, it gives a challenge but it's also not too hard to the point that it's not fun, it may take you a few tries to beat some levels, it's definitely worth it's price, can't wait to see where this goes"
