Duttbust(the owner of capuchin) didnt want people to get doxxed, so she shut down the server, FOR GOOD. Later on capuchin the game was hacked, the hackers got into playfab and duttbusts account. So they changed the game completely.and when you joined the game, your hands were circled and you were on a red platform with blue boards, and on the boards shows your IP address, your irl name and phone number, and a couple of other thing, no dave no online, no nothing. In the background it played extremely explicit music about doxxing, examples of the lyrics were ""i just crashed your f_____ door"" and ""break into your f_____ house and crash your f_____ car"" and a button that said click me that sent you to a web that shut down your headset and PERMANENTLY glitched and broke it. Duttbust had enough and shut down playfab( the online, dave and cosmetics) later the discord was back and duttbust said ""no more, im done with capuchin, no more updates for ever"" so she was gone and capuchin was dead, fortunately the hackers aren't able to hack anymore. So for 2 months no one was able to play online BUT DONT WORRY because duttbust said “ f___ it IM COMING BACK” and is currently giving the game to others and remaking the game completely, also changing the engine from photons to mirror do i the devs keep doing their thing capuchin could be back in a couple of weeks or even days!🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 Fyi doxxing means getting someone's personal information.",down here for banan Your far lol Your close Man chill it's right here.🍌 STOP YOUR GOING TO LAND ON THAT WALL 🧱💥 Welcome to the backrooms:) (short huh...) (Doxxing is over),Hey there! Theres a surprise scroll down! Not even close YOU GOT THIS COME ON AND….. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 🎉ba boom you reached to the end here’s your surprise🎉 🤯 Capuchin Leaks? HUH?? Wow I wonder what are the leaks! Hm Duttbust saying he’s coming back?? HOORAY!!! devs are working on the game to get the game back? HOORAY!! It will take 3-2 months for the game to come back? HOORAY!!! There will be a new shop? HOORAY!!!!! there will be a new low gravity map? HOORAY!!!,Hey uh I'm confused weather or not the whole doxxing thing is over because it's been quite a while since I've played capuchin. Ever since I heard about the doxxing I stayed away from it but now I'm here reading the comments and I'm starting think if capuchin is still hacked or not can anybody catch me up here???,"If you are seeing this message delete x capuchin RIGHT NOW. Duttbust and plsyfab have been hacked so if you play the game and not follow this advise they might get to know your IP address. I'm not just sitting here though. I think if we rebell against the law that doxxing is legal then we could get the hacker vulnerable. I'm doing research and trying to do something about this situation so if you'd like to help, do so. I currently am angry and the hacker and luckily I have expiernce in many hackers and know how to deal with them. Hacker if your reading this, get ready. I'm coming for you."
