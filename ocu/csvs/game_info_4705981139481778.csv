The instruments are very unique from one another, and easy to learn. The looping system is great, and I love hearing other peopleâ€™s creations too. However, I do think there should be 1 or 2 more new instruments. Overall, amazing game.","After the tutorial I found myself playing for hours and losing track of time. It's fun to play around with, but I could see making something if I practiced. The instruments are really intuitive so you don't need a musical background to enjoy it, but it definitely helps to make a real track. Not sure if you can rip your songs to PC or not, but I'm sure devs could make that possible *hint hint* also, please add more instruments/sounds!",This game is so nice for the fact being that you can make any music you want with creativity this is so fun you should buy it,"I cannot access any music I create except in the app. File viewer is a joke, nothing gets synced.","I bought the game because I thought it would be fun to play around with. I also thought I would check it out as a possible gift for my nephew. I spent several hours making my first song and recording each track. Then, the game crashed and even reboots wouldn't get things working again (black screen only, after the game load screen). I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, only to find out the app data gets uninstalled too, so my work was gone. In addition, since this app doesn't use Oculus Cloud Storage, I had no way of retrieving my tracks. Pretty bad idea for an app that lets you create and save your recorded music. I won't be buying this for my nephew after all."
