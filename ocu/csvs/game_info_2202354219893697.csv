Holopoint,"Holopoint is pure archery madness. Fight your way through waves of responsive targets, samurai, and highly dangerous ninjas - all while drawing, nocking, and shooting your arrows as quickly as possible. Holopoint is a skill based game where progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high score is the goal. This game quickly becomes difficult and requires an active mindset. Holopoint is designed so that only a few determined archers will reach the last wave. WARNING: THIS GAME GETS INTENSE.

It has basically three modes that are all the same; a dojo, a garden, and a dojo timed mode. They did a great job making this game look worth it, but I disagree with the reviews saying it's worth the purchase. I'll be playing with my bow and arrows in Sairento instead. I played enough hoping it would get better that I don't qualify for a refund. Just my opinion, form your own if you can afford to.","This game is best played in a large space but also works very well in a smaller space of several feet by several feet. It is of moderate physical intensity and uses most of the body. Much of the game involves using your ears to map targets around you as they spawn in, then moving to that direction and aiming. You can mostly just rely on your ears for full awareness, which is much better than constant visual checking. It has great replay value, if you have even a modest interest in archery and looking for a game that tests your balance and motor skills, this is one to get. Alzan, please add critical points to the targets in the garden, like the ones in the dojo","This is one of the most fun games I’ve played while having an oculus. I’m a hunger games fanatic so this is perfect for me, I feel like I’m in the training scene. I hope they update this game in the future and make it even more amazing!!",Not many game modes but I love the Tensity of it ￼
