Not the prettiest game i‚Äôve seen on quest by far, definitely clean up the visuals and could you make the train fight part more accessible please? I got really motion sick from it but the rest of the game is fine in terms of sickness, maybe add an option to skip that ride. Really excited for brotherhood update though, do you guys have a release date yet? Keep up the amazing work, Carbon! -Shiny Edit: Also change the description so people understand that there‚Äôs no hand tracking and PLEASE make the gestures more responsive. I try to do the ice bow and i get two shields, vice versa. I do NOTHING and get force push. I try to turn on shield, and the game pretty much says F YOU I ONLY LIKE FIREBALL IDIOT and reverts to fireball. One real example is it gives me lightning when i try to get two fireballs. And LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS. WE ARE THE ONLY REASON THIS GAME GETS MONEY. Everyone on the quest store has been mentioning how bad the graphics are, and you ignore it. TRASH THE AUTOMATED RESPONSES. I saw someone‚Äôs review on the game and they used the response for ‚Äúi played the prequel and didn‚Äôt like it‚Äù on the sequel. Very disappointed. Also just lower the price. No one is gonna play an ugly low poly bad tracking TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR GAME. At least make the price twenty dollars instead of $25! Ridiculous! I‚Äôm now lowering my rating from ten out of five stars to four out of five stars after doing some digging. :(",Would highly recommend if you like a decent story and don‚Äôt want a huge challenge because you won‚Äôt find much difficulty here. Still highly recommend. I really hope that the brotherhood update adds some difficulty or more replay-ability to this game besides just trying to find all the collectibles because the 3-4 hours I got out of my first campaign were an absolute blast! I just hope that the new content is challenging because I only died once on my first run which was normal difficulty. Maybe I‚Äôm just nitpicking.,"Honesly I enjoy the game and would 100 percent recommend. You have a lot of gameplay and can spend many hours in this game without realizing. Overall, great game with good graphics and I don‚Äôt have any criticisms about this game and definitely money well spent. ü§©If you are thinking to buy this game I got you. Send me a message saying the game name and 25 percent link. ü§© ü§©And I‚Äôll message you the link to give you a nice 25 percent off the game!!! üòä","Very fun game. There's climbing, there's baddies, and there's spells to make them go bye bye. Can't wait for the update!! Worth full price as is. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot and remove spaces): t i n y u r l , c o m / d a r k w i z a r d s v r",It‚Äôs my favorite game on oculus. It‚Äôs also one of the best magic game out there.
