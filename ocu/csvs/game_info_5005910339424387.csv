Superfly,"Superfly is an open-world action sandbox game where you play as a superhero who can switch between eight different movement modes. Discover new forms of locomotion as you experiment with pairs of movement modes and explore the city any way you would like. Use each mode’s unique abilities to fight the army of robots invading the city. Interact with the tens of thousands of vehicles and dynamic objects that bring life to the city. Fight bosses as tall as skyscrapers while you dodge their EMP and hacking attacks. Collect gears in the Story Mode to unlock even more unique sidegrades for your powers. All objects and abilities are entirely based in the physics engine, leading to emergent gameplay limited only by your creativity.

I think you should download it because it’s really fun and really entertaining and you can really play as any superhero you want frozone Spider-Man Iron Man even superheroes you don’t really wants to play as like I honestly think you should play it and have a good time like I had","this is one of the best games ive ever played so i came to offer some ideas for new powers in the next big update. first is a barrier power, if you hold trigger it creates a energy wall that gets bigger the longer you hold trigger, you can also make a bubble around you if you hold trigger and put you arms on the opposite side of you body. if you press trigger you fire a mini square. for the next power i think it should be a sound power. if you hold tigger you can emit a sonic beam from your hand￼ and if you press trigger it can shoot a sonic blast. The next power is like like a claw power. if you press trigger it shoots out claws from your hands and if you hold trigger it let’s you use the claws to slash your enemies. this is the last power it’s a wind power that allows you to make wind blades and gusts from you hand, if you swing from up to down horizontally while pressing trigger it makes a wind blade that flies at you enemies also if you hold trigger you make a wind gust that blows your enemies away.Maybe for the robot octopus arms you could make eight arms on each hand and also make it laser proof . the last suggestion is to make the feathers for the wings do more damage",I love this game so much super fun can entertain you for hours the creators should add mind control if you hold trigger the robot your aiming at will be on your side and if you hold grip the explode themself Also they should add super man powers if you double tab x you can fly if you hold trigger you shoot lasers from your eyes and if you hold grip you can freeze enemies also you should give user of this power a durability buff,Plz read this plz.See I or anyone would think it will be a great update for the people that doesn't have PC or something .More to the story I would love it if there was alike another secret base under water or one in the sky so it can have like secret notes and then unlock it with something big. Oh one more add things to the city like a bridge or like sewers under the city that would be so cool.
