Great story, voice acting and gameplay. Me and my wife played this over a three day period, playing one chapter per day. Was sad that it was over, we were really getting into the story and the groove of the gameplay. Really hope they add more chapters in the future. The boss fights were great especially the last one. Wish there were more multiplayer coop games like this immersing you in a known story driven franchise.","Myself and my girlfriend love this game, playing coop together. Just what we were looking for !","it was okay, fun multi-player","3.5 star for me. It's fun to play with my kid. However, it's 3 levels (""chapters""). Each level has 3 difficulty bseetings. So nine times through and you've conquered the game. It's replayability is mediocre. You also can't queue for a random lobby as a group. Otherwise it's a pretty decent game.","Description says it all, almost. Short short short. I HATE when the tutorial is used as a first level or chapter. Like getting ripped off. This game isn't awful but should really be priced at 5 bucks"
