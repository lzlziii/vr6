The developers truly do their homework in regards to capturing the staple video game experiences of each time period they showcase. What a genius concept. There‚Äôs so many monumental time periods in video game history that this series can make new editions for years to come! VR has some good titles out there, but several really lame ones. Lately, most of the new release game trailers have been ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. Just the same boring concepts being recycled over and over. However, whenever I see a new Pixel Ripped title, I‚Äôm immediately eager to purchase. This series‚Äô brand has quickly made its way to the top of the VR chain in terms of quality. Without seeing a new releases trailer, a buyer can simply look at the title and confidently purchase the game expecting a cool and relatable (nostalgic) experience!","I am running out of words to describe the sheer genius of the developers of these pixel ripped games! I was a MASSIVE fan of the other 2 and was hugely anticipating this 3rd instalment and as usual Arvore and the team did not disappoint! Same degree of charm as the others, absolutely love the way it pays homage to the different eras of video game consoles as well as what the era was like in general when looking at surroundings etc, it‚Äôs so cleverly thought out from every single angle! Again immensely love the creative way the games cross into the real world during certain boss battles and the way you have to go into the flat version in game versus being in VR in order to progress, again a masterstroke. I sincerely hope there are millions more of these games to come because I could play as Dot and save the world time and time again! You guys rock and I‚Äôm already looking forward to the next one! Whenever that will be! Thank you ever so much for a mind blowing, charming, creative and ingenious experience once again! üî•üôÇ","So I love the series, so I‚Äôm gonna give you a five‚Ä¶ but I did want to ask for one favor‚Ä¶ please add free-locomotion in the ‚Äúpast scenes‚Äù if you ever make another game. I was really hoping you would incorporate that in this game, so I was a little disappointed. I‚Äôm dying to walk around in those nostalgic scenes, just to soak them in. For instance exploring the Atari offices would have been a dream come true, or even just to be able to walk around the 1970s living room and peek out the window. Please consider it! Game is great but it could be legendary with that extra bit. Obviously it‚Äôs too late for this title, but it could really increase the immersion in the next title.",The devs asked me to have a cameo roll in the game so I've got to give it 5 stars right? Well the games so good I was going to give 5 stars anyway. Search YouTube for 'Pixel Ripped 1978 by Paradise Decay for my 1st Impressions video.,"25 off for the VR homies: b i t , l y / p i x e l r i p p e d 1 9 7 8 (comma is a period and remove all spaces) As a fan of pixel ripped 1995, WOW this game is bigger and better and these dev's deserve so much praise. I'm 3 hours in and I'm tingling with excitement and adrenaline, this game is challenging in the best way, and the visuals are mind blowingg. Whether you are familiar with these old school games or not, you must give this a try. Wow wow wow. God I love VR. Heading back"
