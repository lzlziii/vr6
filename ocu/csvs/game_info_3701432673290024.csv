There were no people at the theme park but for some reason TWO stray dogs that bark inseccantly when you get on the ride. There is also some weird voice-over saying things like ""the next stop is station yellow."" And it never stopped. I COULDN'T GET OFF! I honestly felt like I was in a horror title. Not sure how this got onto app lab or how it got any more than 2 stars by anyone. Maybe I'm missing something. Worth an install just to see how horrifying the theme park is and ponder the great questions of the universe like ""where is station yellow????""","Look, it's not without imperfections, but it's free and it gives you a virtual reality theme park, there is literally no other Quest 2 game like it!
