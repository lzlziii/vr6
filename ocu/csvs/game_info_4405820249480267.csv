You start out in this pretty little toon environment and meet your teacher who will walk you through 30 minute lessons, I believe thereâ€™s 7 of them currently but more to come. You will practice meditating with your teacher and in between lessons you can come practice what youâ€™ve learned. I canâ€™t think of a single negative thing to say about this app. Ok, so I guess the graphics arenâ€™t the best but Iâ€™ve get to see good graphics in VR. They definitely arenâ€™t the worst Iâ€™ve seen. If youâ€™re new to meditation youâ€™ll learn a ton. If youâ€™re not new to meditation, youâ€™ll learn a ton. Seriously, itâ€™s good guys and I donâ€™t say that very easily.",I am so impressed by the instruction this app brings. I've done a few different types of meditation and have researched much online apps phone/pc apps/ASMR/VR etc. and this one by far brings the best step by step way with detailed instructions that teach everything necessary to get a meditation practice going. Well done.,"I love love love deeply how this particular app has helped me to learn how to meditate properly. The techniques in this app are extremely beneficial and I have already seen a shift in how I manage and react to my environment within three days. I am truly grateful for this app, and the creators, and all the intelligence and wisdom that went into creating this exquisite educational tool. Thank you so very much ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ","I just wanted to mention how impressed I am that someone had taken the time to actually teach formal meditation (as in sitting positions, have positions, technique, etc.). The developer is immediately reachable and responsive on Discord, and I'm looking forward to accessing the coming new content. I purchased this not because I wanted to buy one more meditation app; rather, I wanted *technique* so that I can meditation practice. ... Now if only I could integrate this with my Muse neurofeedback device to measure what is happening in my brainwaves while meditating --- *that* would be beyond cool.",Very educational and relaxing.
