Pioneer: Endless Journey,"Get ready to become a pioneer in endless journey! Pioneer: Endless Journey is an FPS Roguelite game on a floating island in the sky. You can collect and combine weapon parts of pistol to create many various combinations. Some make each other explosively better, but some kill each other. You would need to try hard for the best combination. You can also throw orbs with special skill. There are some useful machines throughout the island. You even may be able to move forward avoiding all attacks with your awesome movements. You can have a completely different map every time you try. Each of your choices will determine the future. There will never be the same map and islands. Like your weapon combination, your combat experience will be different every time. You can't win with the same strategy. Retry and retry to defeat all monsters and bosses. You will keep getting stronger and stronger.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Adventure, Shooter",English,0.5.6,bHaptics Inc.,bHaptics Inc.,https://www.bhaptics.com/,"Mar 16, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4294717720629293/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4294717720629293&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_PyAcSlNz0ztPIo2fwndaIFC6267bvZZDBv7FuYB7Bk/edit#heading=h.27saurytun3c",Terms of Service,1.16 GB,"This is so fun to play. I just wish that I had multiplayer and I wish that I was away funny but it deserves a five star anyway it is so fun and it’s fantastic the way it is but it does need some bug fixes like sometime I’ll just make me glitch out of the map which I really don’t like and also you should add multiplayer and maybe even a great graphics a little cooler that’s just my opinion. I hope everyone enjoys the game. if you enjoy this game then I recommend that you just find this helpful and also when you play is a little bit laggy sometimes just like Pavlov but you’ll get eventually used to it but it will glitch a little bit and I really want to fix that, but it’s not the best game ever but it’s probably one of my favorites I wouldn’t. I really wish I had a multiplayer and if you’re planning to make multiplayer then there’s￼ one of the best games ever respect this game is so fun that basically I wish my grandma 𝐒𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐎𝐍 VR , I will play sometimes most likely I will either be playing gorilla tag, but I don’t a lot because it kinda I kinda I kinda kind of that kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kinda makes me mad sometimes, but I’ll get used to it",This is such a great arcade style game! My friends and I play it until we die and it's such a fun competition we cast to the tv and take turns with the head set. The game play is easy to learn. I would love to see more after you beat the final boss. I recommend this to anyone. Thank you for such a fun game!,"Just finished my first successful run and came straight here to praise it and let the devs know there’s at least one more person waiting for the rest. Everything about the game is good. The environment, colors, movement, enemies & weapon system are all solid foundations for greatness. It just needs more. (And maybe some kind of persistent progression, idk) The last update was a year ago, but I see the dev talking down here, so who knows what could happen. Hope we get to see this thing revitalized at some point.","I'm not sure if this has been fixed by the time I'm writing this, but there's no left-handed mode and the gun just sticks to my right hand. It makes the game awkward to play and I miss a lot of my shots. Please reply to this and fix this issue. Edit: changed from 2 to 3 stars because I found out that there is a left-handed mode. Still problems, however. The dev/devs didn't think the left-handed mode through and decided to also change the movement. So now I have to move with the right joystick and look with the left, and it is very awkward and confusing. Please fix this or make a new movement setting. PS. I love the black hole looking thing that you can throw in the air and bombs rain down. JUSTICE RAINS FROM ABOVE","I don’t know if there is a coop if there is not please add it, it would be a lot funner, so pls add it"
