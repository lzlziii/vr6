Nothing to Declare DEMO,"Congratulations! You just got a job at the Populistan International Airport, but this is not your usual airport… You'll have to prove that you are capable of being a security agent at this prestigious, absolutely 0% corrupt airport. Your job will consist of checking passports, making sure people are who they say they are and don't forge documentation, pat down people if you need to, find contraband and above all, follow the orders from your superior.

I played it once and there is not a lot of content right now but it's because it is only the demo, I played through it and now it won't open again. I hope the full version is available soon. Great start for a really cool VR game.",I always wanted to work in an airport and learn how procedures done. This game has given me the ability to figure out how things work in airports in a fun and interactive way. I’m impatiently waiting for the full version but we haven’t gotten any updates from the developer..,I waiting release,"I think the title says it all, I think the game is really cool, and I think I've played through it 3 or 4 times. I'm looking forward to the real game because the demo is already really cool and the game will probably be even cooler. All in all really cool demo and I would recommend it to anyone else.",This game is amazing for the price and I can’t wait for the full game!
