Camping,"Camping is a very popular outdoor activity, but due to various reasons, people cannot easily enjoy the fun of camping. Now, as long as you put on your VR headset, you can go camping anytime, anywhere, and even experience amazing things that would never happen in reality. This meditation-like experience should allow you to find inner peace. The moment you put on the VR headset, you can immediately travel to the snow mountain. you will be alone in the snow, and you can make food, play with sweet toys, feed small animals...more surprises Waiting for you to explore, I hope you will enjoy this peaceful place that belongs to you. At present, only the snow mountain camping scene has been completed, and other scenes are still in production... After the subsequent version update, you will be able to travel to the beach and the moon to go camping.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Simulation",English,1.4,MiniSea,MiniSea,http://www.miniseavr.com/,"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5181184631900850/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5181184631900850&r=1, http://www.miniseavr.com/?p=17852",528.1 MB,"This app feels so realistic to me and the environments are stunning üòç Please.. Please... create more environments to hang out. A Fall environment would be great, as Fall is the most popular season for camping. Can you also create a teleport feature where we can move around in the tent. Great job developers.. QUESTION TO APP DEVOPERS: Would it be possible to create a height adjustment? I've tried to use this app as I was sitting up in my bed, however, I couldn't reach for anything because it was too far down. Thanks!","I genuinely like what the dev did here. Despite it being more of a meditation/relaxation app, the dev added a ton of cool mechanics to keep it interesting. For what it is, it's a very cool app. A couple things I'd like to see added: -Free movement around your campsite -the binoculars. Kinda freaked me out for a second when I looked through them and my face was pressed up against a picture of the sun. maybe add some birds that you can look at using the binoculars. -a cooler that contains your food. - water dispenser -storage container with your cooking utensils -bundle of logs that you can use to build a camp fire at a fire pit. (Ability to cook hotdogs, make s'mores, burn sticks etc.) Just to name a few. Either way, this is a really cool app and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys camping or is looking for a relaxation app Last note: I know the premise is to be a relaxation app, BUT the mechanics are solid and I can see this having potential of being a cool PvE game. Nothing crazy like Green Hell, but somewhere in between where they add some basic PvE elements like hunger, thirst, ensuring your food is cooked, and some additional basic tasks that you'd find yourself do while camping. While I'm sure that's a little far fetched, it could be cool",I suffer from a lot of anxiety and panic. Attacks I have to say your app has helped me a lot nice peaceful atmosphere well worth the money I look forward to the next update good work
