Escape Room: Bank Robbery Gone Wrong,"As a subject of a virtual test you have been transferred into a world where you are a customer of a robbed bank. Left alone and locked you must gather all of your abilities to get out of that space which is full of secrets. You have no one to help you except your own wit. Can you solve all riddles and escape? One of the genres for which VR is perfectly suitable is the Escape Room. Dive into this experience and enjoy the capabilities of your VR Headset in this indie game that should take you around 90 minutes to finish without counting the bonus content. After finishing the game a new game mode is unlocked - Speedrun. Try your best and publish your results to compete with your friends or the community worldwide. Two bonus rooms ""Office Trouble"" and ""Geek Heaven"" are already available. Expect more bonus rooms and improvements to the currently published ones in future updates.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Adventure, Exploration, Puzzle",English,1.5.0,Vasil4N,Vasil4N,https://vasil4n.com/vr/,"Jan 26, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4528444947250227/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4528444947250227&r=1, https://vasil4n.com/vr/privacy.html",392.3 MB,"If you’re an escape room genius, you’ll breeze right through but a great start for beginners! Started off moving along fast then took a bit longer in the vault. Some puzzles are obvious while others have extra stuff to throw you off. Very simple environment. Looking forward to the unlocked bonus rooms and any future additions.",Best VR game so far,"The experience of playing this game was so nice, I liked the music and the scenery. I find the puzzles interesting and challenging, but the hints are always there when you need them! I'm happy to see that the developer is adding new rooms and I can't wait to play new levels!","I'd never done an escape room before (VR or irl) but this was so fun! Challenging enough to make you think and explore the environmental, but not frustratingly difficult. Definitely recommend if you're a first timer or experienced. Also really good at getting you used to the VR environment if you're new to VR in general.","I managed to get through the entire game with minor bumps but, that's what escape room games are all about. At times the puzzles are simple and you quickly move on to the next ones but I had to stop to understand or find things I needed to progress. Graphically, the game doesn't blow you away, but I think it doesn't bother to have fun solving the puzzles prepared by the developer. In summary, the game is super chill, the puzzles are at the right level! I certainly recommend getting acquainted with the title."
