Still a beautiful app. If you are in stationary boundary (sitting in a chair) it’s really difficult to do look down to activate stuff. Other thing would be to get rid of the ‘stars’ you add after awhile. I was by the ocean just enjoying the piece and quiet and then those little blue stars you added appear. Kind made it less relaxing. An addition for Harry Potter fans is to somehow let them know in map menu that’s the train bridge from the movie. Went to that location and was like ‘so cool, Harry Potter’ but wouldn’t have know from main menu that’s what it was for sure. Hope this helps. Just a beautiful app and really like that added benefit of being at the ocean and feel like I can relax.","Love this app! I am a big fan of Wander and Alcove because of the “traveling” you can do seeing different places. Teleport Scotland is a very polished app. The scenery is stunning and the fact that it is video makes it much more realistic than Wander. Some of the places by the sea could even be used for relaxing / meditating. Each place has an information panel giving you the history of the place you are looking at, which makes it informative too. Looking at the map view it looks like there are more countries/places to be added which will make the app even better. Can’t wait for the new places to be added!","Lots of visual places to visit. Castles and beautiful shore places to visit anytime. What you get is a 10 to 15 sec film clip on repeat, it does bring life to the scenery and it doesn't distract if you are watching and listening to the sounds of nature. It has music on them, but you can turn them off by going to the map for total relaxation in an area. Was happy with price for what I got, but they are going to have a new update of areas, so well worth the money. Must add no movement to explore places, for those that wonder if it is. Still it is worth having.","Disclosure:This review is of a freely provided copy of the software, but is not sponsored by the author. All opinions expressed are my own. As a big fan of Wander, and similar virtual reality travel experiences, I was keen to learn of another app that offered a similar experience in App Labs. One of the appeals of this app, for me personally, was the fact that it was set in Scotland, which is close to home for a UK Ex Pat living in the USA. More appealing, was the notion of a Wander-like experience that was based around 360 video, rather than static images. My first surprise, upon launching the app, was that it worked completely independently of touch controllers. The implementation of the navigation system is highly polished and effective, however. As such, I can see how this would immediately circumvent any issues that may otherwise be experienced by individuals with certain disabilities. Navigation is split into three areas/mechanisms: * World Map * Country Map * Location The world map, activated by looking at its icon at the lower part of your field of view, shows the ambition of the author, and the potential of this application going forward. Each continent and country is shown, with several clearly labeled as potential future destinations. Whilst the current scope is limited to Scotland, expansion to cover other countries and locations is clearly on the cards, and shows may hour of potential enjoyment for the future. Gazing at this location will take you to the country map. The country map, in this case Scotland, has bullet points for key locations to where you may travel. Simply gaze at a bullet point, and you will be teleported to that location. This is where the sense of presence first hit home for me. I could see birds flying in the sky, waves crashing upon the beach, and almost feel the wind blowing through my hair (well, perhaps not quite, but almost!). This was a level above Wander. As I looked around, I noticed the third means of navigation. Within each location you may find points of interest, marked with an indicator positioned relative to its location within your field of view in this virtual world. Once again, simply gazing at the marker teleported me to the associated point of interest within the location. Gazing upwards to the sky, I was able to return to the map, from where I could find panels of information to the right. The panel contains a thumbnail of the location, and interesting information about the location. As you travel around, your experience is enhanced by gentle, unobtrusive background music. For those would prefer not to hear such music, however, there is an option to disable this. Overall, I was very impressed by the polish and content of this app. I have by no means visited each location in Scotland yet, perhaps about a third of them, but look forward to returning there soon, and hopefully new countries in the slightly more distant future.","Before the pandemic started,I really enjoyed traveling, and since then the Quest has proven helpful in filling that gap. Before this app, I only had Wander and Brink to travel the world, and this is a beautiful addition to that collection. It contains a fair amount of 360 3D short video loops depicting locations across Scotland, and apparently with more to come in free updates.(I will hold you to this, devs :D ) You don't need to use the controllers, as you just look up to bring up the map, and look down to teleport to random locations. While this works well most of the time, sometimes it gets in the way of just looking up to admire mountain peaks. The quality of the videos is very good, and the music, while understated, sets a wonderful nostalgic mood, that is only enhanced by the framing that slowly sorrounds the main attraction when first looking at it. I felt like I was inside a living postcard, and I almost felt the wind on me. The only negative I have about this, is the fact that after about half an hour I was feeling kind of dizzy, but this is normal for me with 3D entertainment. I would also like the option to go back to previous points in locations, and maybe more information about the places. In conclusion, I think this is definitely worth the asking price and worth supporting. I also love that there is a FREE DEMO. I'm really looking forward the next locations, and I would even be willing to pay for dlc packs of countries around the world. Congrats devs, you are artists!"
