Gladius,"Gladius is an immersive VR sword fighting game set in ancient Rome. As a gladiator, you will choose your weapons, train against different enemies, and finally fight for your freedom in epic battles against the mightiest warriors of the ancient world. Win the crowd and you will win your freedom! There are 4 different sections: 1) The Games: Survive for 7 days in the glorious Colosseum fighting the most formidable enemies in a variety of themed stages (Egyptian Temple, Naval battle, Maze, â€¦). 2) Arena: Compete on the global leaderboards on 5 different challenges (endless, weapon master, bridge defense, market and chariots) and become the best gladiator in all of them. 3) Training: Completely customizable game mode where you can choose weapons, enemies, and duration of the game. Players can fight solo or in teams with other NPCs. 4) Community mods: Play scores of community created mods, from deadly beach ball guns and giant spoons, to ancient pyramid reconstructions or forge arenas.",18+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Fighting, RPG",English,"1.0

Good graphics, physics and FUN! Some aspects might be improved such as the crowd, but in general is great. Please keep it updated! Highly recommended. Thanks!","update! (for alpha) i tried the alpha and there was a clear improvement, that's all I can say this game is becoming really very very good, the sensations are better than those experienced in blade and sorcery even if they are different games, I much prefer this to blade and sorcery ------ Update: physics still needs to be improved, because sometimes gladiators rotate 360 degrees on themselves when pierced by the sword, or make unnatural movements -- his power is what it stands for: gladiators and fighting, graphically it is good but technically influenced by animations which are almost as good but not as good as they should, which have not improved during development and I don't think they will improve, battle talent goes a long way road, much better as animations, but also as graphics, not to mention combat physics and it's still free! this game is paid and the developer aimed to add a lot of content, but left the game engine and animations not perfectly in place. - there are wonderful things like the great colosseum but that leave you disappointed when you realize that the audience is 2d, you would have to invent something to make it better. occasionally gladiators perform strange unnatural rotations when shot. the tigers still have something to improve in their movements. all the others added later (mummies, skeletons, etc.) better not to talk about it because it would have been better not to put them, they are full of defects and it will take a long time to make them perfect, and I don't think it will ever happen. I think this one had to specialize as a fighting game with impeccable graphics and physics and instead took the path of multiple contents while remaining technically raw in the heart, but going to make happy the multitude of users who asked for these contents and to whom the graphic perfection or technique doesn't matter",I was in social studies in 7th period and I was wondering why we had to learn abt Greece and Rome. Then I got home and was scrolling on my phone to find an ancient Rome game. This has helped me learn things about the Gladiators and the colisseum.,"Just bought a quest 2 and this is the first game I bought.. can play it for hours, would love to see pvp/coop modes though and more weapons added like maybe a pike or spear","I can't believe the game is only $10. There is an immersive campaign that feels rewarding. It's so unique. Different weapons, objectives, enemies, challenges. Boss fights. Animals. Climbing. I cannot express enough that this is hands down the best Oculus game I've played. Besides the campaign, there is a sandbox mode with tons of different weapons and enemies. I played this game for 6 hours yesterday, and I only stopped today to write this review. BUY IT."
