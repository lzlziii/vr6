Gave me a nice thrill on a Thursday afternoon. The sound design is excellent in creating an atmosphere that puts you on edge while searching for the supplies. It seems like the aliens are attracted to the torch and it took me a little longer than I'd like to admit to realise that you can turn it on and off.
