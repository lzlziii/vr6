Super Sword,"KORPcorps helper droids has proved to be invaluable to society, assisting humans in a wide variety of tasks - from police work and national defence, to housework and hospice care. Eventually, KORPcorp tried to conquered the final frontier by attempting to imbue the droids with the capacity to feel emotions. But when they introduced this last update to their line of droids, something went terribly wrong. How wrong? Well … you are the last human alive. And not for much longer. Super Sword is a game where you hack and slash at malfunctioning and overly emotional robots, with the goal to stay alive as long as possible (and get your name on the leaderboard, of course!) The game contains 5 different types of droids to fight against, all equipped with unique movement and weaponry, each modeled after and inspired by a specific emotion.

No offense. Thank u (ideas: maybe add like a sandbox perhaps? Thanks.),I love melee combat in vr but I can't enjoy this for longer than 5 mins it's a bit too basic needs more layers I mean you have the core gameplay and I think you have the potential for a good game but you just might need to add stuff like faster droids or more enemies if you worked on this a little bit it could become a great game Ps: game Devs if you see this maybe try not releasing a game every month but really spend a good time on one game and make one that you will be proud of as one month is too short of a time to make a game and I think that you can really make a great game just give it time and don't make a short one,"Seems great but some things can be added to make it a 5-star. Movement, sandbox, more enemies, ect.",Too simple. Just stand there and slash stuff. Terrible graphics. Played for 2 minutes and got bored.,"Thank you for checking out Super Sword!
