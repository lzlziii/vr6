Remember the first time you put on a VR headset and were blown away by the feeling? PianoVision will give you that feeling in AR, helping you to play an instrument that you have no experience playing. The program comes with lessons where you can practice the scales and chords, as well as 3 levels of songs to practice on as you improve. It allows you to reduce the speed in order to learn at your own pace and coordination. You will start to feel your muscle memory build quickly as you play the scales and chords. You can feel your fingers become more limber and controlled, with the AR showing you exactly where to place your fingers to hit the right notes and also how long to press the keys. When you put all of that together, you find yourself making music. To hear yourself make music in a way you never thought possible is truly life changing. It stimulates a different part of my brain and makes me feel more alive. If you want to learn more variety of songs, there is an option to upload custom songs to play in PianoVision. So, you can download different midi files of music that you enjoy and find yourself playing them in no time. I do most songs on 50%, which was overwhelming at first; but, you will find yourself speeding things up as your muscle memory improves. I played Jump by Van Halen over the weekend. Granted it was at 50% speed and I hit 58 wrong notes, I will never forget the smile on my face. My first memory of wanting to play the piano came after watching ""The Sting"" with my dad in the 70's. ""The Entertainer"" by Scott Joplin came on and I was mesmerized by the sound. I can't hold a tune, don't read music and never thought I could learn the piano. Fast forward 45 years and I now know the beginning to ""The Entertainer"" and feel that same joy I did as a kid again.

I hope the devs could add it to the app.",Iâ€™m going to try this one out and see if I can figure out how to do it,This is such a great learning tool built in the vein of your favorite jamming game on console. You can also add in scores of your choosing easily. Highly recommend.,Not worth it disappointing 100%
