Even though it’s on app lab, it feels like a full game. Download the Meteoric VR app on your phone (or get other people too) so you can play with friends. The hand tracking feels amazing when your using it and it’s a perfect* game! *Almost. There are only a few things you can buy in the shop, but that’s my only complaint.","response to developers: yes, the wormholes would be nice to be able to activate/deactivate them from the menu as difficulty settings. the idea of unlocking skills both by playing or by paying is excellent. in my opinion you pay for the game immediately and then there is possibly a short demo but separately. 1 vs 1 similar to blaston but without controller would have been great too, but you can do this with a new game. and I'm curious to see how the co-op multiplayer will be, I'm afraid it might cause some lag or some give-ups, like shadows off your hands, I hope not! I don't want to see the shadows go away! ------- hey! I was convinced I paid for this game! but is it free? I can't find it in my purchases so it's free! but why? this game is easily worth 10-13 euros, because it works well, because it's fun, pleasant and original, and it makes you feel good, so why keep it still free? -- This is a game where handtracking finally works well, you could do it with both controllers and handtracking and it's more fun with the latter! it is also fun and stimulating, the graphics are good even if simple and everything is also nice and fluid as a framerate and the dynamic shadows are a nice touch of technique! is constantly improving, already now it's a full five stars for : perfect handtracking functionality, fun in the game, level of challenge, pleasant environment... who knows what they will add in the future ! I think playing cooperatively with two headsets would be nice, but also a challenge mode but in that case I was thinking of a separate game mode, which looks like a blaston, each one on his own world to defend, which lasers are thrown at each other to avoid. .. but the developers will decide that! ha!, I forgot .. speaking of lights, effects, colors, we are like balance and beauty, usually I am very attentive to these aesthetic details, if I really have to find a small flaw it is the fact that the colored black holes on one side facilitating the identification of the meteorites on the other side, however, make the picture a little too rich in my eyes but it is only my personal taste, probably in the future they could make colored black holes optional for a little more difficult gameplay and a slightly more sober visual impact, we'll see! also nice and pleasant is the gimmick of flying saucers that shoot lasers and the possibility of choosing how to counter them: with a hand shield, or using one's physical abilities to dodge the blows! brilliant! here I would like a little more insistence with the enemy hits by the UFOs, to create a part of the gameplay where you can spend a few moments dodging right to left or ducking several times while trying to destroy them, or use the shield, obviously in this part the meteorites should give a momentary respite! anyway keep it up the game is amazing!","I never write reviews but this game is so simple, yet so elegant. It truly feels like a natural fit for hand tracking. Might as well be a Ironman game (don't tell Disney) One thing for the devs, maybe I missed it but I had no idea this game had hand tracking support until I put down my controllers for a second to do something and then I realized it works with just hands.","While it still needs some refinement for accuracy, the hand tracking in this game is the best I've experienced in VR. The gameplay provides a decent workout, although I wish there were more opportunities to duck and dodge. Graphics are simple but stylized enough to give the game a nice aesthetic. Multiple difficulty levels and greater variation in ""enemy"" types would be a welcome addition. Grab it now!"
