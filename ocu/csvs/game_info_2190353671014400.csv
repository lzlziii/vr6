Arizona Sunshine®,"*Includes the new Trailer Park horde map & all earlier free Horde updates* VR meets the zombie apocalypse! Arizona Sunshine® is the original zombie shooter rebuilt entirely for Oculus Quest. Powered by 360° gameplay freedom, the untethered Arizona Sunshine® experience immerses you and up to 3 fellow survivors in a world overrun by zombies more than ever. When you hear a flash of a human voice on the radio, your hopes surge - there are survivors out in the blistering heat of the post-apocalyptic Grand Canyon state! Armed with little more than your motion-controlled weapons and the scarce ammo and consumables you find along the way, you need to navigate hordes of zombies in your desperate search for survivors. • Co-op multiplayer: Join forces with a friend in campaign mode or Horde mode for up to 4 Oculus Quest players • Handle 25+ weapons with real-life movements • Complete a full campaign, solo or in co-op • Freely explore huge environments including deserts, canyons & mines",18+,"Co-op, Multiplayer, Single User","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Horror, Shooting","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish (Spain)",1.6,Vertigo Games,Vertigo Games,http://arizona-sunshine.com/,"Dec 5, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2190353671014400/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2190353671014400&r=1, https://vertigo-games.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,5.02 GB,"Graphics: Real life Impressive Good Decent ✅ Nintendo 64 Trash ——————————————————————— Artistic Style: (in no order) Telltale game God tier indie game Comic ✅ 90s shooter Mobile game Too realistic to count ————————————————————————— Gameplay: Titanfall 2 Intense cerebral stimulation 😵‍💫 Excellent Good ✅ Fetch quests x1000 Point and click ————————————————————————— Difficulty: That one level you couldn’t beat when you were 9 years old Dark Souls Tricky Intuitive, but hard to master Easy ✅ Very easy ————————————————————————— Uniqueness: Never been done Original Original concept, generic execution Zombies ✅ WW2 shooter Battle Royale Every game ever 😳 ————————————————————————— Appropriate age: Elderly Adult ✅ Older teen/young adult ✅ Teen/tween ✅ Child (Screaming) toddler Out of the womb ————————————————————————— Fear (common in even non horror vr titles) Sh!tting myself (Good) haunted house film Korean zombies Traditional zombies ✅ (Bad) haunted house film Loud noises Peppa pig Amytiville Horror (sh@te film)","Worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot and remove spaces): b i t , l y / s u n s h i n e v r Favourite zombie shooter on Quest. Way better than after the fall imo even though this was an earlier game from the same studio. They've updated graphics and added dlcs 🙌👌🤌 Headshots are your friend.","I absolutely love this game. I play with my husband, we have gone through the entire game twice now. It’s hard enough to be fun but not too hard. I play on normal. It’s humorous with great graphics. It’s definitely worth the money. Can’t wait for 2 to come out.","This game came in a bundle, I was playing the other 2 games which were awesome and by the time I got to Arizona Sunshine it was too late to get it refunded..........this game sucks, graphic is cartoony, game play sucks, game is not for adults because it sucks, its suitable for children, I wish I could get my money back....","Just want to shoot some zombies? Then this is the game for you, an oldie but a goodie. Just want to let folks know it doesn't really have a sit down mode though, and for older people like me can reduce playtime as my feet go numb and my knees have issue's too but non the less a classic vr zombie shooter"
