The Fight,"The Fight is VR fighting game, where you can fight as a boxer or a street fighter against various opponents. You can also train at the virtual boxing gym on: -heavy bag -speed bag -dummy bag -focus bag -boxing bar -boxing machine -pads",16+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Fighting, Sports",English,1.17,Adam Stanulewicz,Adam Stanulewicz,https://adam88stanley.github.io/,"Mar 11, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3594052014036763/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3594052014036763&r=1, https://adam88stanley.github.io/",470.3 MB,"Looks like a copy of TOTF but has a lot of potential to be turned into an elite niche boxing game. The training, especially the MIT are excellent but it seems like the developers gave up on the game or didn't have much ambition for it to begin with. If you have no desire to develop it further why not sell it to a company that can build on top of it? It's unfortunate because the potential is there.","Whenever I watch video of people play this game every punch they make blood gets on the opponent‚Äôs face but when i play ill throw punch after punch for 3 whole rounds and not even a scratch and they win, is there some glitch happening or is there someone I don‚Äôt know about yet? I don‚Äôt know but i need help because i spent 5$ and i can‚Äôt even win a fight.",Would be finer in my opinion if it had you whole arm so you could elbow and street fights could be more fun if it had dirty moves.add different characters models and new maps. Would make it great,"A boxing simulator similar to The Thrill Of The Fight with more and better training exercises, but rough AI boxing. I like the variety of mitt training, especially the pads. The traning ecercises alone are worth the price. However, the boxing is very rough, especially when copmared to TTOTF. The AI is stupid but very durable, and it just keeps charging forward carelessy. Their punches are quick, and since you can only block with your fists, it is impratical to defend, so you'll end up attacking all the time. So unlike TTOTF, this game force you to fight hard but not fight smart. And also this game lacks the function of score board and fight statistics.",Dear developers please see this Crappy stuff So the graphics don‚Äôt look that good honestly When the enemy gets dropped it looks weird The refs voice is straight up ai sounding And when u get hit it‚Äôs a flash bang And it feels very empty Cool stuff The blood is a cool effect The training is awesome and feels very good The ability to make custom settings is really cool The punching feels good And the idea of street fight is so ducking cool It just adds so much more to the experience Ideas GET RID OF THE FLASH ITS AWFUL Getting a real person to voice the ref would be sick For the street fight it would be cool if there was something really special like being able to push them or something creative I think it would be funny if when they got dropped they would ragdoll If there were more maps like a fenced cage in a backyard or maybe like a military camp something unique More than 4 guys to fight All of these are just suggestions I think would be cool I would love if u guys made it happen I understand if you‚Äôre on a tight budget but I see so much potential anyway that‚Äôs it and also I don‚Äôt really mind the graphics tbh‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Y‚Äôall are awesome üëè
