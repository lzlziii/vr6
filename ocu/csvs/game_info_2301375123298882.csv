Actually feel like a anime hero. Totally love it. Four stars for now but if there’s more updates with the hit marker. Still I’ve it.,"The game is fun and easy to pick up, but I feel like there should be a multiplayer mode since the game is said to be a social game along with there being opportunities for other players to play the other instruments in a song.","As an arcade freak who is fresh from Gitadora, let me give everyone a crash course who is also familiar. Songs; I got this game WAAAY back when it first came out, and they had all of 3 songs. Now, they have a fair selection of at least 45. Not to mention for my fellow Gitadora fans they have included a couple of GD and BeatMania versions into the game already. Controls; guitars/bass is a pretty doable system, with either slide or guitar-hero-esque button style (which works imo really well) piano reminds me of the tap rhythm games. Drums... What I mainly did on gitadora. Understandably, the foot notes are automatic, but there are times where even at the harder difficulty you will still have auto-played notes in between your actual notes, which makes you think your over tapping the drums. Vice versa, you have to figure out the best positioning for the drum set, otherwise you will reach and think you hit the drum, but in reality you missed. Other than that, drums behave how you imagine. 2 random quibbles I have is that first you can't disable your bandmates (AI or real) random speaking during songs, which really throws me off from completely getting into a song, and second you can't preview songs from the selection screen like you can with almost every arcade song game out there. You have to select the song, which takes you back to the main menu to play it's preview, to then go back to the song selection, for it to recenter your choice menu that is kinda easy to get lost with. Overall, if your looking for the Gitadora experience in VR this gets a passing 70% from me, with much to be improved on, but also a lot better than any other music game out there for quest now.","The controls are good and make sense for the touch controllers. Also has a decent amount of songs, and the music is really good. What would make the experience better is if the crowds had faces and gave expressions to make it more immersive.","I only play drums, so I will only write about drums. First of all, thank you for offering this level of quality at this price. There are no problems with the basic functions in playing. As others have mentioned, you can't change the position of the drums, but it doesn't interfere with play. Of course, it would be better if it could be moved. I think the number of songs is also large for the price. Needless to say, it would be desirable if there were additional songs by DLC, etc. However, the problem is the lack of features to aim for all-perfect. With Perfect and Good, the COMBO is uninterrupted, so Good is mixed and is not evident during the performance. It would be nice if there was an option to have the COMBO interrupted on good. Or it would be nice if something could be displayed only when a perfect continues near the score. It would be nice to have the ability to repeat a certain part of the score, as I can only start from the beginning if I want to practice a part of the score. The effects when you hit the drums are so flashy that you can't see the music score during the repetitive hitting scene, so it would be nice if the effects could be turned off. The music score comes from diagonally above, but the drums are below, so you have to hit without looking at the drums (this is also a problem with the viewing angle of the VR goggles). I think it would be better if the angle of the music sheet could be adjusted, so it would be good to have such an option. Also, in ""TAKE YOU AWAY"", there was a part where the score was not connected with a line even though it was played at the same time. I've written a long list of requests, but I think the volume and completeness of the game are excellent for the price, and I would love to see some DLC. 2023/5/6 I completed All Perfect for Advanced Drum Difficulty on all tracks.! Thank you KONAMI!"
