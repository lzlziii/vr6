Forget the real-life travel headaches, I have nothing but fun on my trips. Love the places I get to go, the things I get to see, and all the great stuff I get to learn about all the places I get to go with this app.","This is exactly what I've been looking for! A long list of travel locations - choose one and flip through the immersive images at your own pace. Some are maps (so you know where you are), some a short info panel to fill you in on each site, and most are 360 locations, and even some 3D. You feel like you're standing right in the middle of a beautiful flower-filled side street in France, for example. And I love the music variety that goes w/ each location. It's not perfect... (hopefully they'll keep at it)... one slide for example was just blank/white, sometimes an info slide would be in French (even though I chose English). Just a few small little things, but overall I LOVE this app! I would totally be willing to pay for it. You get so much here for FREE! If you love to travel, this is the one for you.","There are apps that are way better than this. Try out only get to see pre recorded Google map spots. You cannot see your own. There are better apps that do this. Now, my not installed list is cluttered even more…","I’ve had this app for a few months and this evening was the first time that I actually went in and went through a whole tour. I’m impressed. This is probably the most thorough travel app that I’ve used. You’ll get a very good idea of what a city has to offer as far as major attractions. The developers included a good number of pics for each city, with historical facts for most locations. Bravo! You will learn a lot. ￼Although there is lot of content here, I hope they continue to add more locations. I’m surprised that more people don’t talk about this app."
