You point at one tower, hold, and point at another tower. Then you get control of that tower, and repeat. You can also unlock a variety of card-based abilities. It's actually very pleasant, a bit hypnotic, and trundles along nicely. But it also lacks some very basic TD staples, like genuine progression and variety of stages, enemies and live upgrades. There's very little explanation of what towers do what, so you don't really understand why you should upgrade one over another. In any case, I like it. It isn't a proper TD game (Captain Toonhead is and is great) but this is something different. Still strategic, good but not great. I'll keep playing it as it's an enjoyable loop.","Tower Defender is a good base to build a tower defense game on. The fundamentals are there, covering the puzzle and strategic aspects of tower defense. The game is fun and entertaining for Tower Defense fans if you aren't expecting a very unique experience. I would describe the game as very functional but lacks some immersion and unique atmosphere. Although the game still feels a little basic, the developers seem promising and eager to collect feedback and continue to make the game better. I think this is very important as there are too many games where developers abandon a paid game. There's a number of aspects that the game can improve on: 1. Game needs a higher refresh rate. With the current graphics, I expect the game to be able to run at 120Hz. When panning quickly, you can see the lower refresh rate appear as stuttering. Game performance should be important here. 2. There is a lack of explanation of how the different towers work. Add this to the tutorial or introduce them during the first few levels of the game. I think there is some interesting game mechanics that can result from the use of the different towers but it needs to be communicated to the player. 3. The center of rotation when using the two-handed grip to rotate the world is bugged. It appears to be rotating around one of the hands. This makes the rotation very uncomfortable to the player. The usual way to do this is to rotate at the midpoint of both hands. Please check and update how the rotation works. 4. Add a left-handed mode where the cards appear on the right-hand and left-handed players can use the spells with their left hand instead. 5. Bug: Pointer switches to hand when grip is used. Pointer should only switch hands when the trigger is pressed. 6. Add a co-op multiplayer mode where both players need to co-operate to defeat the mission. Make the mission unique where each color is controlled by one player so both players must do their job to complete the level",Let me start by saying tower defence games are not normally my thing at all. I normally find them dull and uninspiring and just generally tedious. This game though has something about it that keeps me coming back for one more go every time. It's not a traditional tower defence game as I have known. It's more a capture the map and wipe out the enemy rather than just sit back and not get invaded. The maps start out simple one on one maps with a few towers each but gradually evolve into multiple enemies that require you to manage where your troops are going to depending on what the opponents are doing. It becomes increasingly difficult to decide who should go where but the game never seems unfair to you. It leaves you with the feeling that in defeat you could probably beat them next time if you just changed tactics slightly. There's a nice selection of unlockable hero's on the game too. Graphically the game is lovely. It's not photorealistic obviously but the style suits the game perfectly. Sound wise is the same. I have experienced no performance issues whatsoever while playing this game it just runs beautifully for me. I would like the addition to design and share your own levels in a future.update but aside from that there is not much I could suggest to improve it. I guess some people might like multiplayer as an option but that's not really my thing. The ability to move the board around or to move to other side's would be a welcome addition to. Oh and the ability to customise the colours of your hero ðŸ˜Š All in all a superb game for the money!,"I really like the base gameplay, which works quite nicely in VR, so I definitely see a lot of potential, but I think that it needs to be expanded upon before it can be a success. The lack of saved progress pretty much kills the game for me. I personally think that this is mandatory for adventure mode to work for many people. I have these suggestions: - A campaign mode where you have a story line and stages that are not generated, but hand-crafted - I'd like the game to save your progress in adventure mode. Right now that game mode is really only usable for people who have a lot of time to play and don't get interrupted to do other things. I really think that this is one of the biggest detriments to the game, not only putting of a lot of players who don't always have so much time, but also frustrating players who do, but who get very far and then get interrupted when getting to a very high level. - There should be an option to pause the game in single-player. People get phone calls and the like. - Adventure mode should show the level on the screen between stages. That is actually where you want that information, to admire how far you got, not so much while playing. - This game seems perfect for a multiplayer mode - I'd like the levels to start paused so you can get your bearings and do some planning. Even just a 5 second countdown would be nice so you can figure out which towers are where. - Please add achievements for people motivated by that. - It's a bit weird that file access is demanded for the game. Don't understand why you'd need it. - Multiplayer mode can be combined with outfits, so you can show off your unique personality to others. - I don't like force quitting apps. It feels wrong. So a quit button would be nice. You can make it natural by having the door be the exit-button.","I enjoy these kinds of strategy games though I will say this one feels unique to me. One of the more polished app lab games that I have played. I like the heroes as well! My suggestions are adding co-op, more variety in music, and a few more sound effects. I think adventure mode can be challenging and I appreciate that there's also an endless mode as well. Any more modes would definitely be welcome but I like these as is! I would also like if there were more races to fight. Like demons/orcs, undead, etc."
