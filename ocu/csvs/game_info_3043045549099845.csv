The main problem is that it’s just not fun. If you want a similar game that does it right, get Mother Gunship","There should be a bestiary or enemy somewhere in the game, as I have absolutely no idea what most enemies do, wherein I get killed by then immediately because their projectiles do something that I can't seem to dodge. I love the aesthetics and the combat feels fun, but there is a SEVERE lack of information ANYWHERE.",I really want to like this game but when pulling the weapon out of the orb fails 80% of the time (the main mechanic you're supposed to be doing) it's unbelievable and unacceptable that this got past any kind of QA testing. Seen many other reviews with the same complaints,I love the game but I have some ideas for weapons One idea that I really would like is a spell That travels between enemies if you shoot one The bullet would spread to the nearest. Everything about the game is perfect so keep up the good work.,"This could be so good. The graphics, style and music are great! I am not generally a fan of rogue likes, and while I've had a couple of recent counter examples. I either suck, or I missed something important in the intro, or this game needs difficulty settings. I played enough to see how I could get better, but losing all my progress each time was just too frustrating. I'm done and it's uninstalled. A couple suggestions for future projects. It needs a better tutorial. I didn't even know where my health was for the first 30 minutes. It needs difficulty settings. In the early level (I don't know if the game changes later), the rogue like elements are meaningless. Just moving the planets around doesn't improve replayability without some progression path. It's just the same thing over and over and then you die. I was really enjoying it for a while, though. Update: OK, they do have difficulty levels. My mistake. I was playing on easy, so I guess I do suck at this game. That doesn't mean I shouldn't be able to enjoy it, though."
