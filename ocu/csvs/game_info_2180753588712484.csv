Red Matter,"Red Matter is a story-driven VR puzzle adventure game set during a dystopian Sci-Fi Cold War. Take on the role of Agent Epsilon, an astronaut of the Atlantic Union dispatched to an abandoned Volgravian base on Rhea, one of Saturn‚Äôs moons. Your mission: to investigate a shady top secret research project. Solve puzzles in a beautiful, high-detail brutalist environment which only becomes more and more surreal as the story progresses. Use an array of hi-tech tools to decipher hidden messages and mechanisms and uncover ever deeper and darker secrets of the facility. But beware of what you may find... Once you discover the truth, will you be able to stomach it?",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Puzzle","English, French (France), Spanish (Spain)",1.0.009,Vertical Robot,Vertical Robot,http://www.redmattergame.com/,"Aug 15, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2180753588712484/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2180753588712484&r=1, https://verticalrobot.com/privacy/",Terms of Service,1.50 GB,"For graphics and atmosphere there's not much to beat this game on the Quest 2. I haven't felt this kind of immersion anywhere else. The puzzles are varying in difficulty, and can feel a bit mechanical, but some are really good. They feel integral to the story (although sometimes a bit ""why would anyone do that?""), and can be solved by using logic and the game environment. If your don't like linear games, though, stay away. It's a straight railroad from start to finish. No jump scares, but some slightly creepy sequences. All in all probably the best game I've played on the Quest 2.",Absolutely breathtaking- there is no other moment in vr comparable to landing on that platform of the moon of Saturn‚Ä¶ Except maybe when you‚Äôre taking that train across the surface a little bit later. This should be required viewing and playing for anybody interested in virtual reality. It really conveys the potential. this review is for the bundle- first one was awesome too,"I‚Äôll keep this short and spammy. If you can get it as a bundle with the second one, if you can use my lnk below or if you can wait for it to go on sale, get it and enjoy it so you can get to the real meat of the story and graphics within the sequel. 1. Half as long as it‚Äôs sequel 2. Everyone tout the sequel with graphics much better than it‚Äôs predecessors. I think it‚Äôs slightly better only. 3. Very few puzzles compared to the sequel. 4. Story is very cryptic but leads you to the explosive conclusion of it, in the sequel. That being said, I loved playing this game. I played it back to back with the sequel and It was like a major AAA game that didn‚Äôt suck. Use my lnk below or other means of saving money because I wouldn‚Äôt pay full price. I hope this is not spamming you as it‚Äôs on the bottom of the review, but should you find this helpful, please consider using my lnk below. Thank you! üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚úåÔ∏è it‚Äôs %25 off.

I played RM 2 first and must say I'm already enjoying the original one even more.,Put oculus address first.... /Perrtti/2180753588712484
