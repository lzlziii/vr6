Please make me a zoo rift, or a forest rift or a jungle rift. This is so wonderful it would be great if you had other programs along the same line to learn about other animals like the ones in this app. Ocean rift is easy to use. It is educational and entertaining. I enjoy that it lets you explore and find other creatures.","There are lots of cool animals and landmarks to learn about and look at. When I just wanna chill I come play this. It's fun, low costing and well worth the money.","This app feels so real that it still continues to keep me unsettled to scared each time an orca or creature swims nearby or behind me, then comes right up to me. Love this app.",It is impossible to select the type of fish you want to see. It only lets you go in circles and seems to select for you. It’s kinda cool once you’re wherever it takes you.,It’s fun! Different things happen with the animals. My family got a huge kick when I was confronted by the great white shark!
