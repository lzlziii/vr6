I like Fortnite, it's night time I mean it's five o' clock, that's basically night time Y'all remember Cartoon Network, adventure time?",The game is a amazing shooter I play it every time I play on my oculus the chat and the games are epic even the sounds tbh I thought it was a game you download once and never play again but I was so shocked the game modes are so hooking and makes me want to play forever my favorite game mode is the chapter the flag it is so well made,"Alright. I like this. This game is fun. It seems like a good mix of parkour elements and Multiplayer FPS. I think the mode for me is the one that’s the free for all. I don’t know the names of gamemodes. I kinda just started playing an hour or like thirty minutes ago. But I recommend this game for people who, like myself, need to get good. Competition isn’t that bad. (From what I’ve seen.) Five stars, hands down.","Since day one that I started playing haven't stopped, I played everyday but since about a week ago I haven't been able to play it doesn't load it just stays blank I tried everything and nothing has worked so far so I ask if someone else has the same problem or if the developer can do something about it Truly yours : Bujing","I like to get smgs and mow enemies. My top pub kill count was 511 kills to 4 deaths…that’s a KD of 128! Can you top it? Kd is 7.02, but there’s one guy with a 19.2 and another with a 35.4…but I play a mix of matches, like pro matches, regular old pubs, such and such…which is where I obtained a mix of skill sets appropriate for different games. If you are super good and find yourself in a pub, yes it feels good to get 300+ kills a match but after 20-30 matches like that you crave a challenge. Take it from me - I’ve been there."
