Downside Up,"Welcome to the Downside Up room, where people walk upside-down, right-side-up and on their side. One person's wall is another person's floor, and yet another person's ceiling. Build walkways and stairs so people can walk from one door in their dimension to another. But build fast! The people walk at the same time you're building! If they run out of walkway, they collapse. You frantically scan the room. Behind you, a person walks towards the precipice. With seconds to spare, your mind races. What type of walkway do you build? How do you rotate it for a person who walks on his side? Can you avoid the other paths crisscrossing each other in all three dimensions? The walkway just barely snaps into place before the person crosses the threshold. But there's no time to celebrate. People above and below you speed towards their demise. Can you save all of them? Play the game using either Oculus Touch controllers or hand tracking.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,Puzzle,English,3.4.88,David Mines,Downside Up VR,https://downsideupvr.com/,"Dec 13, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5705108336180957/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5705108336180957&r=1, https://volcanolairxr.com/downside-up-1#fdee1d6f-9bc8-4304-ba05-63dc25414ee8",386.0 MB,"Will someone just back this guy with a load of money? Even the tagline 'can you think inside the box?' is brilliant, let alone the name of the game. This is what VR needs - originality - and David Mines has got it in spades. This a very clever spacial puzzler where speed of thought is paramount. Downside Up is the follow-up to the great City Of Eternity, which you should definitely check out too.",Very cool game. Once you pass the listed levels then its a little confusing what you are doing next and how to navigate around the different levels beyond the ones listed. I also tried to do multi player and it was impossible to get into the game with another person. We both tried it and we both had no luck. Maybe all in due time though. So far so good!
