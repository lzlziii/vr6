But on the Rift S and Quest it dosn‚Äôt look that good, should be more optimization put in to it. Please make an Quest Pro / Quest 3 optimized version! Another reflection the visuals are way better ‚ÄùArms/Guns/Characters‚Äù on the first version of this game! Still only on the Rift/RiftS maybe to be ported to Quest) Compare them and you will be amazed how much better that is on the Rift S If you got a Quest go for it, it‚Äôs kind a fun anyway!",I miss the old dead and buried one the zombies was simple and the multiplayer was relaxing but I feel like all of that has changed. There is now team death match that feels nothing like the old game. They even messed up the zombies. I miss just sitting somewhere and shooting them but not all running around. They just have to learn the simple is great even sometimes better,This game was the best but after 3 years I play this game but there was no players I played this game on my oculus rift and it is sad to see this game have no updates no player you will be missed ü´°‚òπÔ∏è,Love the game great graphics waste many hours playing it . As a result I see many glitches and disconnects . Hope they fix it soon then I would rate a 5!,"I love this game, especially the shootout, deathmatch makes me nauseous. Developers need to fix the ability to cheat. So many people are hiding behind stuff and reaching their arms THROUGH the virtual solid objects like barrels, walls, and beams.....even some of the bots do it. You can sometimes see their faces peek through the object also. This needs to be made not possible as it makes it impossible to kill the cheaters. Everyone should have to shoot around and over objects. The way it is now makes it not fun anymore as more players are hip to this cheating glitch and are destroying honest players. Please.fix it!! Also please fix the issue with the invisible bots!!"
