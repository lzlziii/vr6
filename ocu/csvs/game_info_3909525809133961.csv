Exit Condition One Demo,"This is a classic escape room game built exclusively for VR using roomscale to give you the experience of really being there. Walking is fully supported. Your hands and all objects act just like in the real world, no ""ghost objects."" The puzzles are all tightly interwoven into the room and feel more like problems that need to be solved rather than puzzles that need to be figured out. There's about an hour of playtime. Cool Features - Roomscale ( walking, locomotion, teleporting, stationary, sitting all supported) - In-game visualization of the guardian to align physical and virtual spaces - Drone with unique 3D controller - 90hz support on Quest 2 - Full use of physics - VR within VR - Fireworks display for finishing - Dynamic background music - In-game hint system - Distance grab assist There is a discord here: https://discord.gg/2NfBumhKQD .",3+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Adventure, Puzzle",English,.999.12,Damon Poole,Damon Poole,https://exitconditions.com/,"Jul 22, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3909525809133961/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3909525809133961&r=1, https://exitconditions.com/privacy-policy/",693.0 MB,I really enjoyed trying to figure out this puzzle and thought maybe it was just the first room of many more. I only downloaded the demo if I purchase the game are thereother rooms to escape from?,"This demo caught me off guard as my expectations were low given how most escape room titles end up being. This one is more like a full on adventure game, which is even more apparent in the itch.io paid ALPHA version. If you are into games like Apex Construct, this may be one to add to try out. Looking forward to the full game.",I admit I struggled a bit getting control of the drone but beyond that it was amazing. this was a great preview but I SO WANT THE FULL GAME!!! When is it coming???,"Hey , it was a good escape game , i am waiting for next rooms ! little glitch found : if you hammer the button ""get up"" while being under the desk and you come out from under the desk you make a super jump and can access high doors when they are on the top.","This is the best escape room I’ve ever played on the oculus, and this isn’t the full game yet. I can’t wait for the full game to come out. Somethings that can be improved is the hint system, sometimes I couldn’t find the hint I was looking for. But other then that this game was very good. It was hard but I still liked it. Do you guys have a planed release date yet and how much will it cost?"
