I understand they are updating, but there is no timeline on when the feature will be back and I don't understand why they couldn't leave the old system in place until the had the new one. I am sure I will not get a refund, but still, it's pretty lame.",I seem to have forgotten my username and password and cannot log on. I can pm you the email that is associated with the account and hopefully we can recover my username and reset my password. Thanks so much for your help with this. I can't speak highly enough of this app. It's just beyond cool. Probably the neatest non-gaming related VR App in existence. Thanks again. :),The best app.,"Unfortunately I had to change my rating by lowering it as the app had started off very well, but the services gradually decreased. It is no longer possible to convert videos directly from YouTube as it was at the beginning and now it doesn't even give me the possibility to upload videos, only photos. I don't know if this feature ended only for premium accounts, but I find it difficult to think of subscribing without being sure that video conversion is also included. Pity...",Pretty cool app! download pictures. Videos on the other hand I don't understand. It will download a video but it won't show up to be watched in 3D maybe I'm doing something wrong ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” I would give it five stars if they can explain how to download videos.
