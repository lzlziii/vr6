VR-ME: Abandoning Ship,"The «VR-ME: Abandoning Ship» app is about an emergency declared on board and given the impossibility of controlling it. Conditions that lead to abandoning a vessel: -In case of a fire: When the flares are increasing and block the access to the place where the fire extinguishers are kept, and there is no possible way to put the fire out. Fires is a major risk for a vessel, particularly on a passenger vessel as a great number of people will have to be evacuated; -In case of sinking: A sinking vessel leaves no other choice than abandonment, as the situation cannot be amended; -In case of capsizing; -In case of vessels’ collision. In any marine accident, the vessel has to be abandoned after the Master and their Officers have evaluated the stability of the vessel. The development of the «VR-ME: Abandoning Ship» app is co-funded by the Erasmus+ Programme of the European Union under the framework of the Virtual Reality for Maritime Emergencies (VR-ME) project.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Educational, Simulation",English,1.0,SQLearn,The consortium of VR-ME project,https://vr-me.eu/,"May 11, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/7357804420961060/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=7357804420961060&r=1, https://www.sqlearn.com/privacy-policy/",794.8 MB
