The gun mechanics are quite good, but the arm to arm combat isn't great. Throwing things that land miles away from the enemy seems to kill them anyway. Screen glitches every now and again and the gameplay is nowhere near as smooth as similar games like this on the Oculus. Haven't really delved too deeply into the story mode, but the arena mode is a lot of fun, but as I said before, it starts off quite difficult, but perhaps with practice it'll become easier. Has potential to be a 5/5 game, but it's not quite there yet!",Stunning cell shaded graphics give this game a unique look Added to it fast paced gameplay makes it a top contender and a must have game Challenging and addictive gameplay will keep you wanting one more turn Martin76x,Desperate Vladivostok is made by MiroWin the creators of Federation 77. This is another amazingly made game with a crazy story and an amazing gameplay loop. This is a must have if your a fan of bullet hell games! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iuPGkyGEcE,"Amazing fast arcade shooter with intense combat, amazing styled graphics, and lengthy single player mode with added arena mode.",I have played about 6 hours all in the story mode it's fun but challenging you will die get used to it but you get better after time playing. And I'm pretty sure this is the first A.rated game on quest 2. Give it a try if you like games like super hot you might enjoy this one.
