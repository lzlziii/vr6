Labyrinth deLux - A Crusoe Quest (Free Demo),"In Labyrinth deLux - A Crusoe Quest (Free Demo Version) you are space trucker Robin on your way back to planet Earth. By your side - your ever helpful virtual assistant Friday. When caught in a time-loop you happen to wake up in a temple-like space. The only way out of this cube and to the safety of your space truck is to (re)align the laser and point at mirrors, prisms and other reflective surfaces to open the doors and perhaps find answers to your questions or to a truth beyond your imagination.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Puzzle, Space/Universe",English,3.8.2,K5 Factory GmbH,K5 Factory GmbH,https://k5mediagroup.com/games-projekte/labyrinth-delux/,"Jul 27, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4603501616372548/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4603501616372548&r=1, https://k5mediagroup.com/terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy-ldl/",364.9 MB,A lot of fun.,"Though the graphics are a bit retro, this demo really amazed me. Voice acting and gameplay are excellent. I like the idea of the gravity boots and being able to walk on walls and ceiling. Very promising! But will there be more tasks in the full game than just turning mirrors? How long is the game?",I like the Style. But I get motion sikness from the jumps.
