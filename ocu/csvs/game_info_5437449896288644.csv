I have a few suggestions of updates that can gradually be added. 1. Proper games-You can add an option for actual games vs ai where you have to bowl and bat. There would be a toss and you decide what to do and you should be able to set a separate difficulty to the one in game on how hard your scenario is. There should also be an auto bowl feature that skips a number of overs if you don't want to bowl and an option for am entire inning. It would be cool if there was a test match mode specifically which would be even tougher and more tactical. Obvious for this you would need to make cpu batters and animations for them etc so this would be a long term project. You could earn gems by scoring or winning these matches 2. Keeping-You could add a keeping option where you just have to keep by keeping both controllers (in this case your gloves) close together and you have to catch the ball by pressing grip at the right time. This would be cool for you can then add stumpings etc. As keeper you should also be able to captain your team in the game scenarios such as picking who to bowl and setting your field. 3. Full body-Make it so that when batting you have legs. This makes multiplayer seem more natural and it makes it more realistic. You could add appeals and reviews for lbw when batting and bowling. 4. Highlights- There could be an option for at the end of your batting/bowling session to watch the highlight reel. There is on ball replay but maybe you can add it to replay boundaries wickets etc. This would be cool to see your batting performance and there could be coaching tips aswell that sees your performance and gives advice. The stats should come up aswell. 5. Small other things-Make the fielding tighter sometimes it is really poor how when simple stops go for four etc. Add more coaching and practice options for keeping I hope you take some of my ideas on board but nevertheless I love your game. Thanks",It is a top notch gaming experience for all the cricket lovers. There is a good room for development to get the realistic feel. Looking forward to see the analytics involved to suggest for moves and also correct on the body language to improve the skills.,This is the best game I have ever bought on my oculus. The amount of time they have into it. From chasing down targets to getting top of the leaderboard this game is truly amazing in every aspect. There are 5 levels of difficulty going from 50 mph balls to 90 mph swinging balls. There are nets and coaching on the game. Things I would like in the game: -Visible ball wear - an option to run. That u can turn off in settings -more realistic fielding -Test matches (chasing) 5 stars,"I just love this game. Gives you a close-to-real experience of Batting. That sense of achievement when you smash that ball out of the park, block a super fast ball to save that last wicket on the last ball, it has all the excitement a real cricket match would have. The only complain I do have is getting out to a negative line (ball pitching outside leg stump) as there is no concept of legs, so if the ball pitches outside leg and heads to the stumps and misses the bat, your are done. Almost all the wickets I have lost is against a left-arm over, weather it be fast/medium/spin bowler. Also watch out for Spin bowlers, they are probably the most difficult to face as the ball spins a LOT and the ball kind of comes faster after it pitches. IMO, the outside leg stump dismissals can be fixed by giving the batsman the concept of legs. Overall, very happy with this game and an amazing option for Winter Nets :)",I saw on youtube about the game and bought meta quest 2 for this game only. After playing I must this experience is far more better than what I saw on youtube. Without playing no one can explain better. 10 out of 5
