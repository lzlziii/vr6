Very polished and very, very fun for a few hours with a friend. The only thing this is missing is more levels and randomized enemy spawns. It is very quick to learn the 9 (?) few-minute-long levels and remember where all the danger spots are. The RPG is always in that window, etc. But the game is very cheap, so worth it hours / dollar. DEVS: you have a solid platform here. Just give us some DLC (I'll happily pay!) and a randomizer / horde mode!! (Users please upvote if you agree. :)","If you get motion sickness from FPS games that require you to move and tilt the camera and all that, then this is the game for you. You can literally sit or just stand while playing. Co-op is fun and simple. Great point and shoot while having the ability to crouch and dodge without having to get too physically involved.",I just need more details and graphics 👏 And more people need to respect 🫡 this game I want more game modes And more guns 💪😸👋 :) (-_-) 👣 And it needs buttons To make it easier or harder The fact this is such a good game Is just amazing 🥲💋🖖🏾👄 Respect 🫡,"This game is awesome, I’ve had it for 6 months and just now beating Montoya lol but also I really only played with friends now I just been linking up with everyone and each time it’s awesome. Need A Part 3 please or more levels. I just stopped to use the bathroom and on my way back 😂😂😂 Hands Cleaned 🧼","Fun game but curious if anyone else has issues with the revolver staying in reload mode? Once this happens, I have to exit the game. Only does this on manual reload, not auto. Update 8/20/2023 The revolver has an option to flick your wrist to open the cylinder (instead of just hitting the release button on the controller). When I do this, it'll randomly get stuck in the open position. No buttons or movement's will get the cylinder to pop back in. A lot of times I have to close the game and re-enter. I can attempt to get a recording and send it to you. Hope this helps."
