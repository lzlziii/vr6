Rodent People: Origins,"Rodent People are rats with human level brain power and a body enhanced with bionic parts, who somehow found themselves locked up in a prison. At the first glance, life inside the cell is not too bad. Rodents occupy themselves by working and earning money, which they can then spend on food and other things. However, the days quickly start blending together, and the Rodent People can't keep on living in a prison cell - they decide to break out and find out the mystery behind why they were incarcerated in the first place. While the game is best experienced with team, you are free to tackle the mission on your own. Choose any rodent and use your wits to escape the prison!",16+,"Co-op, Single User, Multiplayer","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Puzzle, Shooter",English,"v0.70

It's a trippy, awesome little indie title that shouldn't be missed. If I had made this game, I'd be so proud. I hope we see more in this rodent universe.","This game is challenging, entertaining and funny as hell. Had a blast playing this and for the price it’s a steal. I would recommend this game for anyone wanting a good escape room experience with a friend. Aside from the actual escape part of the game there is plenty going on to keep you smiling and happy. Hats off to the developer for making this. Keep up the good work.","An absolute masterpiece of an escape room. One of the best multiplayer experiences I’ve had on the Oculus. If you like escape rooms and/or puzzles, this is a must own! I don’t know how this isn’t on the official store with more reviews!","Absolutely amazing experience, great mechanics, even better story. Everyone must try it."
