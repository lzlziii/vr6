And itâ€™s in space!! I love it, itâ€™s nearly impossible to not love this game! Just shoot! Not too much strategy to worry about. ï¿¼Youâ€™re on a platform and all around you is decorated space. You protect yourself from incoming rockets and you gain new weapons and upgrades. You can start with two weapons, or one weapon and a energy shield. I met my first â€œboss enemyâ€œ at level 10. It really is a blast!!ï¿¼ ï¿¼The one feature that I wish the game had is a save feature. You can make it to level 15, and if you die youâ€™re going to start all the way back at level one. ï¿¼Thankfully the levels are not long. ï¿¼ï¿¼Edit:ï¿¼ I had to revisit my initial review. I was too hasty and It just didnâ€™t do the game justice ï¿¼. Itâ€™s a bit challenging at first with leading moving targets, but it becomes addictive. The soundtrack is terrific and adds a great vibe to the game! Youâ€™ll see that the developers took great care with the details. ï¿¼ And Iâ€™ll be paying attention to see what they come up with next!ï¿¼","I love this game and although I donâ€™t get to play with it as often as I wish I could, whenever I do, I always find myself having a blast playing this game. It also helps that itâ€™s not too difficult but still challenging enough at the same time to have lots of fun without the unnecessary frustration of not being able to progress to the next level which I really welcome because that allows me to just get lost in the game to my heartâ€™s desire and Iâ€™m never disappointed on how much fun I have playing it. I guess thatâ€™s why I always find myself coming back every so often just having fun shooting at everything and just focus on how much fun Iâ€™m having playing that I really donâ€™t even pay attention to my score only that I can play continuously until I literally get tired of shooting. ðŸ¤£ I canâ€™t thank the devs enough for all their hard work and exceptional creativity in developing this incredibly amazing fun game and generously making it available for free for everyone to enjoy. Thank you so much devs for bringing so much fun to all those whoâ€™s lucky enough to play your game and wish you all continued success. ðŸ¥‚",great game reminds of of space pirate trainer which is one of my favourite games this one is just as good will be sending a lot of time with this love it.if the Devs see this make more shooters like this I need more arcade shooters,"I'm not a big shooter game fan unless I'm shooting something that does not resemble real animals or people. So this one works very well for me! I'm a horrible shot but I thoroughly enjoy this game!!!! I have not advanced far enough to acquire a 3rd type of gun, but nonetheless, I'm still having a blast. Not giving 5 stars yet since I've not gone far enough to provide an accurate 5 star rating. I also have an issue in that if I play and then leave the game, I cannot restart it. When I go back in, I cannot select anything as I have no lasers with which to make my choices. So I have to uninstall and reinstall in order to play. This is why I removed another star to give it a 3 star rating.","I'm really tired of those dizzying VR games, this game doesn't make me uncomfortable (like nauseous) at all, I just feel the joy of shooting! It does not have any complicated stuff, and easy to play for anyone. My living room is very small, I always hit the table when I play shooting games, so this really suits me"
