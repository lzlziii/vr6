Mythic Mage,"Did you ever want to feel like a powerful mage as you explore dungeons, fighting scary monsters and discovering long lost treasure? Mythic Mage is a dungeon crawler with procedurally generated levels. Fight monsters using melee or ranged attacks! Face giant bosses! Upgrade your stats between floors! But beware: if you die, you start again from the beginning! Unlock permanent upgrades and new enemies the further you get in the dungeon. How far can you get before you perish? Features: ★ Infinite procedurally generated dungeons! ★ Terrifying monsters to battle! ★ Environmental hazards! ★ Shop to upgrade abilities during a run! ★ Permanent upgrades and unlocks that stay between runs!",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Fighting, RPG",English,2.1.4,Andreas Grütter,Andreas Grütter,https://www.facebook.com/MythicMage,"Mar 22, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5044109012328920/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5044109012328920&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/10aIJbCE7sSdmNKTR-5PfX8bTVjyPkZ6BY2cwRRS9wGQ/edit#heading=h.52gwa9acpvcx",346.5 MB,"Absolute fun. So much fun. I think there should be a couple more things to run into besides vases. Maybe throw in a type of puzzle here and there or a change up in colors on different levels. Something to show change in levels. Hell, other than that it's super fun and I definitely recommend. A must have. Again absolutely love it.","UPDATE: 8/20/2022 and I still play this a lot... Still playing this... I am hoping developers keep checking this review and keep doing updates for the game... It IS frustrating to get to like level 27 or so and then die... BUT... I still enjoy chucking energy orbs at the enemies... Once again, how about some updates? Different looking dungeons (they all still look the same after 20 or so levels), different looking enemies (how about some scorpions, bats, maybe some devils or demons, flesh eating blobs, I got suggestions for DAYS)... Still a bit of issue with two projectiles colliding (you can't throw a projectile at the place you already destroyed an enemy projectile), but other than that and maybe adding some new weapons this game could use a little TLC... Still very enjoyable, and hopefully we haven't seen the last of newer updates... PLEASE don't abandon this game! Keep the updates coming, and I'll keep playing!!","Sometimes I get scared, but still really fun! Also you should be able to revive with 500 coins or more.","It is one of the best Applab games out there! I got it when it was free, but I still feel like it would have been worth the $10. There are a good variety of enemies, the teleporting, swords, and magic take skill to use. It is an overall great game.","If you die, you have to start over from the beginning. Adventures are very monotonous and long, so it's hard. The hit check between the attack and the wall is too large, which can cancel or make the attack unreachable. The atmosphere is good, but it needs improvement."
