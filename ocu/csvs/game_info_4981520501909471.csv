Make a complex and interesting story, different types of difficulties and more visual effects and this game will have a lot of fans, even if the game is paid.",I guess if you are new to vr this can be a little fun but there are so many better demos.,"It is very interesting idea, perfect for VR, because you can observe cables and trace which one it is. However sometimes I don't really know how to distinguish them yet. Atmosphere is very nice and there is a bonus game with shooting.","Interesting game. The graphics vary between very good and in need of improvement the pistols look very good as well as the small explosions when hitting the targets. However, the following points of criticism still exist. On the one hand, the cables on the floor flicker a lot, which eventually makes it impossible to follow the cables and connect the right monitor. Another point is that you can intentionally crash the game if you shoot a lot of arrows with the pistol. The arrows do not disappear after a certain time but all remain on the ground. Sometime after 50 shots you notice that the frame rate drops. After more than 100 shots it gets worse and worse and if you want it you can crash the game completely.","I feel like this is just the beginning of a good puzzle game, bit like a test demo to see what people think of the concept before they do. https://youtu.be/viTxge3P1OA"
