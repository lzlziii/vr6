But most of my time on the Quest is spent watching qualitative 360 storytelling experiences. If you own a 360 camera like the insta360 One X or more recent Insta360 One RS, you are likely to have a lot of footage in 360 video format. You can easily share it on your socials, but it’s even more fun when you watch your content in the Meta Quest headset. While 360 cameras are getting more affordable and better quality, Driftspace allows you to create non-linear storytelling narratives on the Quest yourself. Simply upload your assets in the dashboard and put everything in place on the headset. This works very intuitively and you immediately feel and understand how the final result will look like. Share your story experiences with the network or explore what other people are creating. New drifts are created daily and the platform is attracting more and more creatives sharing beautiful “drifts”. With the development still in early stage, there’s some room for growth, but the team is very responsive and helpful in guiding you through the app and creation process. And best of all: if you have a friend with another headset, you can simultaneously experience an experience for an extra dynamic experience. The app is also very useful for judging and prototyping 360 experiences in a more professional context.","Driftspace has been one of the coolest apps I’ve used to create narrative content in VR using 360 video footage. You upload media assets using their web portal and then create whatever you can imagine - from documentary films to travel vlogs to recordings of live events. The video quality is excellent and you get immersed in the experience. You can add text boxes and images to the scene to really customize things. You can make it so the viewer follows your narrative, create a “choose your own adventure” style experience, or a self-guided exploration. In the main menu, they feature a wide variety of different user generated content to give you a sense of what you can build. Pros: The editor is intuitive and easy to use. Everything is drag and drop. I saved so much time over building a similar experience in Unity. It’s super easy to take a storyboard and just…make it in driftspace. Linking scenes together takes a few seconds. And multiple people can be in the same “drift” at once! You can view things with friends or even collaborate on production. Cons: I know it’s still in Beta, but I wish they had more features. Support for 3D rendered objects would be nice, and a web viewer so I can share videos of my content online with friends who don’t have a headset. It’s also buggy, but that’s understandable for early access. Also, if you don’t have a 360 camera to shoot footage with, you’ll be limited to stock footage, which kind of misses the point. Overall, if you have some cool 360footage and want to bring it into VR, Driftspace is the best way to do it I’ve found so far. The devs have told me they’re adding a ton of new features over the next few months too. It really has the potential to be a great platform that anyone can use to make compelling immersive experiences.","Driftspace is starting a platform worth the aspiration to become the YouTube of 360 video. Tell stories, create education, lead viewers through an experience you create in your Quest headset. It's the killer app for 360 that's putting me over the edge of buying a 360 camera so I can create my own drifts.
