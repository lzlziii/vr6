The ones I have found I am never really excited to play again. This game however does not have any negative side effects and is SO much fun! I get so excited to play it each time! I love the new dishes you learn, the new zombies, and the new weapons and dishes. It's so exciting, fun and addicting! Love this and highly recommend it!!","I first saw Horror Bar on The Facebook group Total VR Gaming and decided to give it a look! I'm so glad I did because i have so many positive things to say, it's absolutely fantastic. It's easily become one of my daily plays. Such a fun and wacky concept! The graphics are superb, whoever is doing your environmental art deserves a raise! The textures are beautiful, it's all so smooth and very easy on the eye. It truly feels like the characters are really in front of you! The feeling of immersion is incredible, i could play for hours and i have! I love the variety of characters, some had me laughing out loud, you have done a great job of filling the game full of great humorous touches like hitting the fish with the mallet. All in all i will continue to play Horror Bar for a long time to come and I'm really looking forward to future updates. The possibilities are pretty endless with regard to learning new recipes and adding more grizzly ingredients! Congratulations devs! You have made an excellent game.","I find this game to be really enjoyable. I have played most of the bartending/serving games available for VR and this one is one of my favorites. I find the controls to work well and are pretty intuitive. I like that as another day starts, you get a new item to make. Then you get a tutorial on how to make it before your next shift starts. You can make it as many times as you would like until you have it down, or just roll into the day. The progression of adding items as I go, make all the menu items manageable for me. Things aren't too complicated to make, at least right now, which I appreciate and the weird ingredients and different zombie customers make me giggle. I haven't had any issues with bugs while playing, but sometimes with updates, bugs happen. My advice is to notify the developer. This developer is quite responsive and constantly working to improve the game. A fun addition for all ages to add to your game library.",Iâ€™m sitting here in the middle of the night thinking of ï¿¼getting a refund and then I realize it is a work in progress and I should wait I hope I didnâ€™t make a bad decision pls update the game like add more drinks and food and more stuff like I now on the rift version you can cook the frog pls add but besides that it is ðŸ‘Œ,"This game is great but I am experiencing some jittery like performance issues but this game Is one of the best bartending games it actually feels like your running a bar and I love that it's not just drinks. Ignore most of the 5 star reviews they are almost all trying to get you to use there refferal code, to be completely honest I'd wait until a couple patches role out because this games has so much potential"
