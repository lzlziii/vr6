Bullet Roulette: Peaceful Edition,"Four suspicious persons with mysterious pasts are sitting around the table in the gloomy dark bar playing a gun roulette game... with a toy gun. Why? Because it has been already too much violence in the wild west so everybody got tired of it. Nobody has to get hurt this time. Beware of other players, because they don't look like someone who plans to play fair. Be tricky and become the last one standing!",12+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Casual, Simulation, Social",English,1.06,FIBRUM,FIBRUM,https://fibrum.com/,"Jul 6, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5512932282149764/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5512932282149764&r=1, https://249724.selcdn.ru/public/privacy_policy_for_fibrum_updated.pdf",841.4 MB,"Great game, tons of fun with friends. Happy to see that it's on the Meta Store and is on track to receiving updates again. But Meta forcing these devs to tone down the firearm references is insane! Shooters such as Pavlov and Contractors have real revolvers that you can play russian roulette with, usually depicting more violence than even the original versions of Bullet Roulette. Even SUPERHOT had a gun suicide scene that was allowed on the Quest store, even if it was hastily removed by someone on their dev team for some reason. The double standard being displayed here really sucks, the new audio and visual feedback in this Peaceful Edition partially botches the tense atmosphere created by the original versions, but I guess getting onto the main storefront is the only way for FIBRUM to succeed on this platform. In terms of actual game feedback, all I ask is that you return the automatic seating calibration that would occur when entering a game like in the original, or add a proper seating calibration mode in the settings or when you first open the game. Can't wait to see more updates! EDIT: My feedback was addressed really quickly, thanks guys.","It's amazing how wide a range of emotions this game brings. If you play with npc, you get angry at how difficult and sometimes scary it can be with them. Playing with real people (and especially with friends) is ridiculously funny.",I feel like it would be better with a real gun and stuff and if meta lets you add a gore option like in the OG game,It’s was fun but trying to play with two friends does not work one friend joins and the other cannot idk if I’m the only one with this problem though,Too bad oculus is holding them back. You should still get it though I played for about an hour or 2 and didn’t want to stop but my oculus was getting low on battery. Would recommend
