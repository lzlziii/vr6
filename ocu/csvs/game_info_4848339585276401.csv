RaceMaker VR,"Ever wanted to create your very own custom race tracks, then experience what it'd feel like to race on them in first-person? RaceMaker VR allows you to build your own unique racing masterpieces, then go head-to-head against the CPU or the clock (in Time Trial mode) on your custom creations!",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Racing,English,1.0,Code Without Limits Ltd,Code Without Limits Ltd,https://racemaker-vr.netlify.app/,"May 3, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4848339585276401/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4848339585276401&r=1, https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/87368577",116.0 MB,I TRIED TO TURN IN THE GAME AND IT PUT ME IN A STRAIGHT LINE INSTEAD OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO! THE TURNING ONLY WORKS SOME OF THE TIMES! BECAUSE OF THIS MY HEADSET ALMOST GOT SMASHED CAUSE I HAD SOME GAMER RAGE! FIX THIS OR I'M NEVER PLAYING AGAIN! Overall the rest of the game works but I could have gotten a new headset because of this!,This game is very fun but has a few bugs this includes not being able to turn and sometimes spawning inside the track. Even with these bugs the game still finds a way to be fun. If this game didn’t have these bugs it would easily be 5 stars. Suggestion add a no motion sickness option if possible!,"I love the game and the whole idea of making your own track and racing on it, if you can get used to the controls and know how to build a good track it’s really enjoyable! Only reason I’m giving it 4 stars is because of some AI bugs. I’ve encountered that some of the AI can get stuck on walls or on jumps but aside from that I haven’t found many problems with it. I’ll definitely continue playing it!",This game has endless opportunities! Whatever you want to do. And then adding the multiplayer to the game… chefs kiss it’s perfect. I don’t normally feel comfortable in racing games but I didn’t feel sick at all while playing this. Power ups are fun to mess around with and the community is very chill. It’s very mature at the moment not a lot of crying children when you beat them.,The game is fun I enjoy making tracks and racing on them but there are a few bugs and a tutorial would be nice as the controls were a little hard. If you like build and/or racing this game is a 100% get as the bugs will be fixed in updates so I recommend this game and BEST PART ITS FREE so I think it a really good game
