Crisis VRigade,"Crisis VRigade is a virtual reality action filled first person shooter that lets players take on the role of a SWAT trooper and deal with terrorist situations. Play solo or team with your friends with the coop multiplayer mode. Duty calls! Youâ€™re put in the middle of the action. It's a dirty job but someone has to do it. Together with a SWAT team you will have to deal with the situation and take care of the terrorists. Your mission is crystal clear: finish off all hostile elements and keep your teammates and hostages alive. Be aware of your ammunition and take cover while reloading your gun or you will be exposed and the mission over: maybe you see the bullet coming, maybe you didnâ€™t, but the terrorist got away and your partners now have the unpleasant task of giving the bad news to your nearest relative. Everyone counts on you and your first-of-the-class aim. You got the highest rates at the academy, itâ€™s time to prove it!",18+,"Co-op, Single User",Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Shooter","English, Spanish (Spain)",1.30,Sumalab,Sumalab,http://crisisvrigade.com/,"Jan 26, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3926597184026195/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3926597184026195&r=1, http://crisisvrigade.com/eula.html",Terms of Service,1.15 GB,"Time crisis for quest, with coop. Good for experienced players and new comers. Canâ€™t recommend it enough.","Visit linktr,ee/gaving7095 for 25 % off many Oculus games ðŸ˜€ Iâ€™m familiar with this tricky-but-fun game from my PSVR days. Love it on Quest with superior tracking and itâ€™s priced really well.","This game is hard. Tons of enemies shoot at you at once and bullets fly by your head. You're pinned down and crouched behind cover for a lot of it, only to pop out occasionally to shoot a bad guy. If this description turns you off, this might not be a good game for you. If you're looking for an intense and challenging shooter, you will probably like this game. There are only three levels that last a maximum of 7 minutes to complete (assuming you don't die first), but there are different paths you can take to complete them. The game offers a lot more playtime than 21 minutes total, though, given how difficult it is to get through the levels without getting shot to death first. The controls are, well, unique, and they take a bit of getting used to (grip to unload a magazine, trigger to grab a new one from your belt), but they're not the worst thing in the world. There is a shooting range where you can get accustomed to the mechanics. (EDIT: It is possible to change the controls to the more common ""grip button to grab, A button to unload clip"" mechanic from the settings. D'oh.) When you're playing through the story, you will play the same parts multiple times due to the difficulty. On the flip side, because it's such an unforgiving game, it's *extremely* satisfying to finally get a perfectly aligned headshot on an enemy and then immediately duck behind cover in time to dodge a bullet shot by another enemy. The graphics are cartoony, but they work well for the game and don't detract from the intensity. The game feels extremely polished, and I have yet to encounter any bugs. (EDIT: If you shoot yourself in the head enough times or get killed by a friend in the menu area, the game will get stuck. Try not to kill yourself.) I recommend playing with a friend or two--it's easier to progress and a ton of fun. If you have $6 to burn at an arcade on shooters, get this game instead. It'll last a lot longer and be a lot more fun. To anyone still reading: Sorry for the rambling! I will clean this up later and make it less of a strugglebus to read if I get around to it.","It's fun, challenging and good exercise. Always a good time.","I figured with as inexpensive as this game was, it's probably glitchy and mediocre... I figured wrong! What a great game, and so well developed. I have yet to pass level 1 on rookie, but enjoyed every second of losing ðŸ˜†. Great job creating this!"
