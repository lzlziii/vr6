If you guys could fix the controls a bit, and after a few updates, this game will be great!",Squadron One Deathmatch is a full blow Dogfighting space simulator in Virtual Reality. It takes a few minutes to get used to the controls but I had a blast playing it! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdUTU0PeKeg,"Really enjoyed the game overall, but my experience ran into a few issues related to the controls. There seems to be a deadzone in the corners of the joystick controls. This works well when using joystick mode since the vertical tilt and barrel rolling are very distinctly different types of movement. You don't want full blast mixing of the two in the corners. However, with the arcade/controller setup, you get extremely slow aim movement in the corners, resulting in only the main 4 X and Y points giving you appropriate aim adjustment. This might be intentional by the developers, but it felt really unnatural compared to other console flying games. In joystick mode, I felt like I could appropriately chase down enemies, but not so much in controller mode. If that was fixed, I could see definitely going to 4 stars! EDIT: Another plus, the headtracking weapon aiming was really cool and slightly offset the control issues. Great use of unique to VR capabilities.",I lived this game it has so much potential and it gives me star wars vibes,This game is amazing I only ha e one issue and it's that I can't figure out how to play multi-player but I'm sure it's my problem and not a game problem but other than that this game is 100% 5 ðŸŒŸ
