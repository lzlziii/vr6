Next Player Please,"Next Player Please is the first fun and engaging Mixed Reality party game using a single headset passed around a table for two to four players and only one device that is passed from player to player. In quick tournaments the players are pitched against one another in various mini games, whether it be fishing, building a fortress or digging for buried treasures to win the trophy. When your turn is over and the screen turns dark, pass the headset to the player on your right. Play with hand tracking for a simpler and more natural experience or play with controllers, letting inactive players use the left one to play with or against you. A headset full of fun for everyone! ** RECOMMENDED SETUP** Have good light conditions and draw the guardian around your table. Hold the headset with one hand without covering the cameras. Be careful to not let the headset fall while playing. We accept no liability for a broken headset.",3+,"Multiplayer, Co-op",Sitting,"Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Casual, Social",English,"0.0.3.5

Quest does not really have a party game. None that l am aware of for more than 2 people at least. This has now changed. Think a bit of ""Keep talking and nobody explodes"" but for more than two people, and in Wario Land party game fashion too. The passthrough used here is very expertly done. Admittedly l did not understand yet how to let the app see my hands instead of the controller as they advertize, but still. Even with just the controller, this is a great party game, heck it is the only party game. Great quality mini games (10 of them). Great tutorials and very unique. Get it while its free folks!",Next Player Please is a well designed Introduction experience if you want to Show off VR to your Friends and just as a Party Game in general. The diversity of modes is refreshing and the simplicity of the interaction lends itself well as a family entertainment option. A must have for Quest users.,"That's a cool concept! Fast-paced mini-games with enough time to switch between players. Very funny. In some games, you compete, while in others, you cooperate. + Very intuitive, with a proper explanation for each mini-game. + You can draw where your play area (empty table) is. + Hand tracking works super well. + You are never disoriented bc you see your whole room in other colors. - The speaker's voice sounds artificial. (That can be a plus. I know we're in the future if we play something like this.) Overall very cool casual game!",...and I'm surprised why there aren't more. The concept is so simple and taking turns with one VR headset works great. The party games are easy to pick up and quite diverse. Passthrough lets you see your friends who are mocking you while you play. It's just fun!,"Awesome collection of games with different mechanics to each game. My favorite one is ""build and destroy"". And you can play local multiplayer with only one Quest! Very unique idea, you need to try!"
