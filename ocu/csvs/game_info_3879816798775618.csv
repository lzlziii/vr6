GAIM,"Improve your skills as a hunter or sports shooter with GAIM virtual training simulator. Practice shooting and hunting in the comfort of your home, and with more sophisticated tools than at the shooting range. Precise barrel tracking, correct animal anatomy and correct ballistics ensure detailed understanding of your shooting technique. Together with analysis and replay of every shot, this simulator will take your training to the next level. Practice on targets where you set the distance, speed and direction then test your skills on running game in driven hunt scenarios or a set sport shooting scenario.",3+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Simulation,English,2.3.6.0,GAIM,GAIM Immersive Technology Group,http://www.gaim.com/,"Jul 15, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3879816798775618/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3879816798775618&r=1, https://www.gaim.com/media/wm1jw4g4/privacy-notice-for-gaim-software.pdf",Terms of Service,1.26 GB,bro there’s so many free games out there that offer exactly what you guys offer with less lag and more movement and freedoms lower the prices and let us enjoy it already bruh all this extra going to a different website instead of just buying it in the oculus store as a add on was extremely frustrating and irritating to even have to deal with just to find out it’s $35 for a map that’s just yellow instead of white with a slightly bigger animated lunk of meat hurtling itself across my screen with no change what so ever might as well played the demo the whole time do not waste your money,"Wish there were more modes like American skeet, bunker trap, and sporting clays.",Hi ! Perfect to practice youre shooting skills! Would be nice to have the possibility to decide if you are standing on the floor or on this pedestal… Best drivenhunt practice ever!!!,"For me, Gaim is the best way to improve my shooting skills and build lasting muscle memory. Of course, training with Gaim cannot replace the shooting range, but it is definitely a useful addition. In addition, contact with Gaim is always very friendly and quick. If there should ever be a problem, the team makes every effort to solve it quickly. Please continue with your great work!","I am practicing Compak and Sporting for one year. Gaim is wonderful to train yourself and consolidate your basics : feet positioning, visual point, hold point, shooting point. You can test pull through, pull away and maintained lead to know which method best fits you. I am missing long clays where you need to have an important lead. A bug on the Five Stands with the rabbits. I’m no longer use it until they fix it."
