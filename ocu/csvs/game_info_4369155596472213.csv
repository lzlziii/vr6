RealityViewer,"Experience virtual realism as never before! Explore beautiful locations and real estate properties in 6 degrees of freedom and a visual quality that you haven't experienced on your Quest before. Reality Viewer is a free showcase application for our virtual reality conversion service. Using our proprietary technology, we can convert scenes from any 3D software and any renderer, or lidar scans of real locations, into highly realistic virtual reality experiences. Navigate through these virtual spaces using your Oculus Touch controllers, or even directly using only your hands. To learn more about our conversion service, please visit www.roomscalestudios.com and get in touch with us, we're looking forward to help you!",3+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing","Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", 360 Experience (non-game), Exploration, Simulation",English,1.0,RoomScaleStudios,RoomScaleStudios,https://www.roomscalestudios.com/,"Mar 14, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4369155596472213/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4369155596472213&r=1, https://roomscalestudios.com/realityviewer/realityviewer_privacy_policy.html",3.81 GB,"I wouldn't be desappinted with such graphics on PC, and the performance is perfect. Only complaint is that its really easy to accidentally look out of the bounding box and that is distracting. Would be nice to be able to freeroam or at least clip out from the box, even if I need to enable it in some settings menu.","Thanks unity for the work ! The details are INSANE, but need more products. I finished all the environment in 20mins.. And i add one more negative comment about the moves, we canâ€™t move where we want.","This was great. It made me feel like i was actually there. Great job. However, i feel as if there is not enough freedom. A free move option would be a great app changer. Just need a boundary around the map. Other than that, everything is so relaxing. Keep up the good work!","This appears to be a demo from a company that does archviz stuff. Outside of a few minor visual artifacts, the models are very clean. I was particularly blown away by the detailed vegetation in several of the scenes; the realism exceeded most PC VR. I wish there were some way to hide the menus in the opening tutorial area (the small glave in the forest). The wild flowers are amazing! It would be the icing on the cake if the ocean in the beach house scene had some movement. I realize, however, that this app is already pushing the limits of standalone VR and any option for realistic water is going to be resource intensive.","These scenes look amazing, even in my Quest1. This app shows a future where you can walk in a realistic rendering of your future house."
