It would be nice to go right to the game at startup rather than viewing all the startup garbage.,I love this game. It reminds me of those days at the arcade I would spend hours there. Really fun and easy going game. A great intro into a VR game but with a classic feel. Well done,Unique FPS experience from a big fan of 80s arcade. Gameplay and review: https://youtu.be/xbMRuBxeYXg,"Downloaded this on impulse as it showed arcade cabinets, like what you seen in that PCVR Arcade room. Sadly I don't have pcvr. Opened this up and it's amazing, side scrolling on the rails shooter with immersive parts. Must try for any shooter fan and arcade fans.","Played the demo, I liked game so far. Driving was a bit of trial for me. I will purchase this soon as seems pretty cool."
