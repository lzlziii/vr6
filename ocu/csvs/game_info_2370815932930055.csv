Now, the game haunts me. It's in my dreams and follows me everywhere I go. I can't get away from it. But I spent years understanding the game, and I have even gotten better at the game. I now know that this game is not only a challenge but is also an escape.","Game Runs good. Best poker game out there by far. This beats any other online poker game in terms of fun and enjoyment. Some people take this game very seriously and others dont know whats going on. There is plenty of cool items to get as you play, giving you things to play with as you play poker. Really well done game for being free. I've seen people climb up and get rich without spending a dime. I've seen people spending money on the game but they seem to enjoy doing so. At the end of the day you cant cash out and it was just a game. but this game makes not cashing out still seem fun. Recommend",I‚Äôm gonna start by saying that I‚Äôm 14 and play this game and I really do like it but I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôve gotten banned for being underage it‚Äôs VR it‚Äôs not real and on metas store it‚Äôs rated teen plus I spent my money on the game and there is no way to get that back. I really could wright a whole paragraph but to keep it simple you shouldn‚Äôt pay any money on this game even if your not underage I‚Äôve read a lot of the one star reviews and 90% of them are because of underage bans even tho the people that are getting banned aren‚Äôt underage the devs should really listen to there community or this game will die soon because if you‚Äôve ever played it you know that most players are even younger than me,"Hi poker stars, I got banned for being underage while the game is rated T for teen , I am a teen. Lots of my friends play without getting banned and they are the same age. I like this game and it's the only game that I play with my friends. We all enjoy it. If you could unban me it would be great. I still dont understand why I got banned from a teen game but thanks for your help.","I see the issue isn‚Äôt fixed once again, Part 2/or is this 3 I thought the situation was taken care of in part one‚òùüèæ now I have to make another review and take my stars back on top of the first or second review One review that clearly must be mistaken because it not fixed. It was for a while, and then it went back to the first results broken Might as well be an app lab I do mean what I said I follow the YouTuber (sadly it‚Äôs Bradley) he did say something that‚Äôs going on with Linux however, I don‚Äôt know if that has anything to do with this poker app I don‚Äôt know if the case it‚Äôs very aggravating one minute your in next you‚Äôre out please once again developers fix the problem so I can give the stars ‚≠êÔ∏è back ! P.s as you can tell I‚Äôm way over the age approval !"
