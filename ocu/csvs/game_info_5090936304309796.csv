Sharecare YOU Anatomy,"THE SHARECARE YOU ANATOMY APP IS AVAILABLE ONLY THROUGH THE END OF MAY AT DISCOUNTED, “AS IS,” NO LONGER SUPPORTED RATE OF $5.99 PER DEVICE. THEREAFTER, IT WILL BE DISCONTINUED ALTOGETHER. Experience the human body like never before! Sharecare YOU Anatomy is a larger-than-life exploration of the Human Body that allows viewers to visualize, understand and interact with their organs. This is not a boring anatomy app, nor simple 2D video demonstration–it is a fully immersive and interactive 360-degree experience you have to try for yourself!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,Health & Fitness,English,1.62 (554.30041),Sharecare Reality Lab,"Sharecare, Inc.",https://www.sharecareyou.com/,"Dec 9, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5090936304309796/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5090936304309796&r=1, https://www.sharecare.com/",3.22 GB,Real first class app. Graphics excellent. Information and detail. Worth every penny….great pity it is ending,"This app isn’t finished yet; but I am so impressed, I can’t wait until the next update. I am an ICU nurse. To be able to walk inside an organ has been the most incredible thing I’ve done in VR. I hope the developers continue to add more “internal” views. It would also be great to add some pathology-for example, what it might look like to walk into a lung that has pneumonia. Keep it coming! I love it!!",This app has not enough content compared to the steam version of app. When are there going to be updates?,"Italian language and pass through, please.",I was disappointed by limited interaction. Can’t easily get closer or grab body parts for detailed observation. VR can present various scale and viewpoint intuitively but this does not utilize its strength. Great contents but I’d like to see more VR interactivity and various language support throughout developing.
