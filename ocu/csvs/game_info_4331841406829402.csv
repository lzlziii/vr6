Weapons to unlock and passive abilities to collect.,"Let me start by saying this game has SO much potential. BUT it's absolutely riddled by bugs. It's nearly unplayable after level 5. Your game will crash, you will fall through the floor, something will make it impossible to continue through the game. This would be perfectly acceptable if the developers were working on updates. The sad thing is they have completely abandoned this game, leaving unsuspecting folks to purchase this absolutely broken mess and hoping it will be fixed. The discord channel for D9 has even been abandoned by the devs. Leaving many people feeling they have been ripped off, myself included. I didn't even pay full price and I still feel ripped off. DO NOT BUY Update : development has officially been canceled by the devs.","Dev is probably not dead. But the development of this game definitely was. I had joined the discord server of the dev. They were only active for maybe a month. I was hoping my suggestion of more upgrades would have been looked into. I was only mocked. Game actually softlocks you after a certain point. Devs do not respond to anything. It has so much potential and I wanted to love it... Oh well, I would reccomend you go play Sweet Surrender as that game is playable LMAO","This had a lot of potential but promised updates never came and Dev is not responding on Discord anymore. Dont buy this till the game breaking bugs are fixed, if ever. Oculus, please take this game down!","I understand that this is an app lab game, but many of the bugs make the game unplayable at the moment. I will have to get a refund for now and come back to it later"
