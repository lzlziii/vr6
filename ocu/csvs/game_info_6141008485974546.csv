Z Show,"Choose the car, reload your guns, get rid of zombies and take your city back! At the beginning of the 21st century, the television used to only broadcast telenovelas, reality shows, singing competitions and fake news. People became fully addicted to these shows. In 2036 there was a blackout in Eastern Europe and for the most people the world came crumbling down. They became aggressive, wandered through the streets killing innocent little kittens and in the end became zombies. The best brains in the world, scientists, TV moguls, and producers of soft drinks have put their heads together to resolve the situation. And so they started to broadcast a whole new reality show for the rest of the world.",16+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Arcade, Racing","English, Czech",1.07,Cenda Games,Čeněk Štrichel,http://www.cenda.cz/,"May 4, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6141008485974546/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6141008485974546&r=1, https://cenda.cz/privacy.html",347.2 MB,"This is a really fun racer game as well as a zombie shooter combined. It takes time to get used to the way you drive the car, but once you catch on, it's a fun game. It's like the original Mad Max movie and you are Max."
