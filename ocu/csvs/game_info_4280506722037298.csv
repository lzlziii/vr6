I couldn't find any comfortable way of holding the controller in which I could grip the bat well. The fielders are stopping the ball by diving from literally 2 meters away. Bat's scale is totally unrealistic. Too much spin turn even with beginner difficulty. The whole delivery is readable (in terms of speed) until the ball lands on ground. Then it just goes with super speed, which is totally weird.",Has some good potential to be fully developed. Enjoy the basic gameplay can be repetitive,Great experience in VR stadium!,GG!
