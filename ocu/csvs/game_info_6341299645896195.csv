Discord appears to be dead too. Not much action since last year. Shame. The game had promise.,"How is it that I just dropped $15 on a game that I can't even play because the only option is finding a match... which is never found. $15 to sit at a menu with a ""searching for match"" loading screen. I'll be seeking out a refund on this one. Very let down.","I'm an old Mechwarrior 4 pilot and this game feels very similar...jumpjets, overheating, weapons on arms and torsos, beam weapons with duration times, missiles, direct fire ballistic weapons where you need to lead your target. The same torso twist (can be walking one way but cockpit another). Mechs look polished. Cockpit is beautiful. But the maps need work. But this is a work in progress. Currently there is only 1 game type - deathmatch. But it looks as if there will be others in future like capture the flag and respawn. If you are an old Mechwarrior pilot like me you will love this game","Has potential but I am not a fan of the controls, no customization options and feel sluggish. I like the support mech But it’s almost impossible to aim. There is another mech game on sidequest, called war mechs, that feels much much better to play but it is a simpler game with no campaign or multiplayer￼ or Choice of multiple mech. I would just lift the controls from that game and put it onto this one and this game would be great.","So, this is one of the only mech pilot games I can play, right? Yep. And I have to say. It was a pretty good hell of a game I recommend using a cushion chair and headphones for the best mech pilot experience. The graphics are better than usual, and the combat reminds me of war robots, except this one is better and not pay 2 win So I say buy this if you are looking for a standard mech game, with immersive mech battle action."
