Wrote by chat GPT.","Iron Rebellion gives the dream of piloting a big heavy mech in a Mechwarrior styled tour de force with the most indepth and interactive cockpit and control scheme I have EVER witnessed in a mech game since Mech Warrior 2 on PC. The tight controls, amazing attention to detail and overall gameplay and fun factor are through the roof. While this is still in beta, it does not feel rushed or thrown together with electrical tape and shattered dreams. The team behind this game did a BANG UP JOB. As owner of the coveted Steel Battalion on the OG XBOX with the huge controller, this game was an evolutionary jump up to being able to fully immerse myself in a world filled with giant mechs thundering across a wide open map while blowning up stuff and jump boosting from place to place. This is an experience NOT to be missed and I have HIGH hopes this will come to playstation VR 2 hell I would buy this game for 50 bucks if it did! Cannot stress how great the game is, I have not tried the co op missions but I can see myself jumping into the cockpit of my mech a lot and spending time in the world of Iron Rebellion. Nuff said.",Let me start by thanking the Developers for making such an awesome game. Totally immersive battles put you in the cockpit of a giant m e c h. I prefer the heavy with twin Spitfires. My call sign is HAWKSTEAL. Look for me in the game as I play as often as I can. Four versus four is a totally satisfying feeling piloting one of these machines. I prefer Deathmatch on the junkyard map. Give it a try it is a must-have highly recommend this game you won't be disappointed. Three classes of mechs and a boatload of weapons to customize your layout to suit every sort of playstyle. The heavy is slow and tanky but is hard to kill as it has the highest HP points in the game. Give it a try and look for me in the game.,⣿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠘⢿⣿⣿⡛⠛⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⡟⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿ ⣿⡿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⢿⣷⡀⠀⠀⠈⠻⣟⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿ ⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠴⠭⠤⠤⠄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣿ ⣿⣷⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣿ ⣿⣿⣆⠀⠠⣤⠤⢤⣤⣤⠀⠀⠀⠀⢰⣶⣶⡖⠒⡖⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿ ⣿⠻⠿⠦⠀⠇⠀⢸⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⠃⠀⢹⠀⠒⠛⣻⣿ ⣿⣷⣤⠀⣀⠃⠀⠈⠛⠛⠀⠤⠀⠀⠀⠙⠋⠀⣀⢈⠀⠠⣾⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⠏⠀⠘⠉⠀⠀⠀⠠⢄⠤⠀⠤⠐⠀⠀⠀⠈⠁⠀⠀⠘⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣶⣾⣿⣶⣤⢀⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠤⣤⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⡤⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣤⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ Lin(k)tr(DOT)ee/dogekin Dot=.
