Cus I see these other people talking about free roam and finding treasure and a shovel so… how do I free roam? Or am I just dumb?,I was excited to play but I can’t select a game mode,The game is awesome with it’s free roam but you can’t find the treasure without your hands and your shovel because you can’t even bring your shovel with you without it glitching,I love these ship or boat based games . It was sooo much fun being captain of your own pirate ship .i loved the fact i could fill my tankard in the tavern and have a drink. I felt a real scale of things especially climbing up to the crows nest . I hope this game gets lots more things brilliant keep up the good work im fed up with shooters and zombies. Truly looking forward to more.thanks,Even though it’s a pre alpha I was pleasantly surprised by how detailed this game was since most other sailing or pirate games on be fall short. Can’t wait to see what else is coming next
