To be relaxing one would want to stop, reflect and enjoy the view but you can not stop this avatar from moving, it just keeps circling the island over and over. It would be nice to just stop, sit down and really relax. How about a little grass shack to sit in a chair on a deck looking out? It would be cool to see sail boats off in the distance on the horizon. It would be nice to be able to adjust the volume of the music, hard to relax with the music blasting in your ears. It would be nice to have more atmosphere. More trees, bushes, and wildlife like tropical birds or fish in the water. How cool would it be to see dolphins or whales jumping out in the water! How about being able to sit in the boat and row out to relax on the water floating in the boat. The music doesn't stop. It just goes from one right into another. How about a stop/repeat button? How about being able to create a ""playlist"" with your songs and possibly our own songs. Right now, it's just walking around an island with nothing new to do or see. After a few minutes, it gets very boring. The only control you have is how bright the sky is and if you want to look up or down without tilting your head, and to push a button to change the song playing and using a randomizer you can hear the same song several times in ten minutes. It should just move from one song to the next on the list and not repeat until you have gone through the complete list or want it to repeat. On a scale of A to F this is a big D......","Could be 5 star but needs more to it. Here's a list graphics improvements, more beautiful environments and could be a longer island instead or short island, but you get the picture. have the boat still in the background, Locomotion and automatic, bgm on/off and just the ocean sounds etc, mp3 uploading, and more meditative content. The reason for the extra star so the new dev can improve and keep developing the app. Thanks"
