Can anyone tell me how to change the commands into English thanks. I‚Äôll update my review when I can change levels","Better then Beat Saver, especially if you love kpop. Hopefully more music will be added. Love to see songs from IU, Punch and Ailee üòÅ","Exactly what the tile says. It‚Äôs got the old school colorful feel of a DDR arcade game with arrows to slash instead of step on! I love beat saber but this has a classic look to it that takes me back to when DDR was released and it comes with a lot more music I like than beat saber. I really hope this keeps getting updated with kpop, or even jpop and any other music would be great too! I‚Äôm glad I made this purchase!",Game has a nice collection of songs to play with. Different play skill levels helps you to work your way up in skills. Hopefully the developer will keep adding songs to this great game. Hours of fun for the whole family.
