Cosmic Sugar,Cosmic Sugar is a trance inducing physics sandbox. It can be used for art making and light shows. Cosmic Sugar visualizes natural forces in a way that is similar to sand grains on metal surfaces revealing hidden cymatics. It is a relaxing and engaging universe which responds in completely unique ways to the personalities and interactions of each individual artist.,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity, Relaxation/Meditation, Space/Universe",English,3,ObjectNormal,Light Clinic,https://cosmicsugarvr.com/,"Mar 17, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3979296855448714/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3979296855448714&r=1, https://cosmicsugarvr.com/privacy.html",247.0 MB,"Genuinely one of the greatest times iâ€™ve ever had with a vr game. Relaxing, psychedelic, perfect. 10/10 everybody should try this out.","I bought an Oculus Quest looking for non-gaming, yet mind-bending experiences - I discovered Cosmic Sugar! Cosmic Sugar is the ultimate experience to activate the creative brain cells. You can get lost for hours. Playing with Cosmic Sugar takes me back to being a kid and using a magnet to attract iron filings out of the dirt, then playing with the filings while using the magnet under the table to shift the filings around. Cosmic Sugar takes that concept into a completely immersive 3-D experience. Amazing. Cosmic Sugar is a very fluid experience that will make your mind explore a whole new paradigm of creative expression. It needs to be seen to be experienced.","Hello! I am in absolute love with this application. The only thing I really wish it would be able to handle is letting me reorient the default direction of the headset. I tried laying in bed while using this but unfortunately that was a no go, at least with the lights turned off since the tracking is inactive then. I don't know if it's possible, but I truly hope so. All that being said, the lights and the ambient sound create a hypnotic experience. I kept saying wow out loud in my room, and I can't wait to try doing different things, perhaps creating something like what's on the screen shots.","If you ever had a theory on how our universe came to be.. I'm sure you could create a model,with this simulator. Black holes, white holes, nebulas ,galaxies ,universes, supernovas ext.. best played with headphones with bass.","I love this app! Creating art scenes in 3d space is fun, mesmerizing, and trance-inducing. I feel like I'm tripping without taking any drugs. It's like being on a journey in space with control over the elements of light and sound. Endless meditative, artistic flow state. So good!"
