Everything Beautiful,In this very zen short experience you will play with a host of objects as the protagonist recalls his earliest memories. For the first time in vr you can pet a cute fluffy creature as it purrs and other extremely satisfying experiences.,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Narrative,English,1.10,Dragon Lagoon Games,Dragon Lagoon Games,https://maessof.wordpress.com/,"Sep 9, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4910242182389271/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4910242182389271&r=1, https://maessof.wordpress.com/everything-beautiful-terms/",300.8 MB,"The voice over in this one almost made me cry. It is still rough around the edges, but it feels right so many times, and gives a sensation of tactility. There are many satisfying interactions in here. I swear I could feel the pet! And popping the bubble was super awesome. Great Job!","Lovely vignettes evoke childhood nostalgia. This makes great use of hand tracking and VR's capacity for impossible locations and experiences. The visuals are gorgeous, and the performance is very smooth. Some of the interactions are a little repetitive, but overall there are a lot of moments of surprise and wonder, and it's worth going through everything. Time and money well spent!","The hand tracking could be a bit janky at times but that may more be metas fault , I don’t use hand tracking often but when I do it’s usually been jinxed by an update. The atmosphere / story / sounds were all good , Visually some parts were a bit too dark but overall were good. The activities were varied. The hand tracking again worked better on some more than others. It only took about 10 minutes to play through but you can replay it - it’s quite a relaxing experience I can’t think of anything really bad about it so I’ll give it 5 stars. I enjoyed it, it didn’t cost much and it’s good to try different things. Give it a bit more polish and hopefully you’ll get it on the main store with a wider audience.",it's super well made and is definitely worth the price personally I had a fun time in the bubble part I swear when I popped the bubble I felt it hit my arm it was amazing,"Its more than a hand tracking demo. The thematic music is really nice , theres a bit of a story, and theres definitely an atmosphere about this little experience. Im not sure how some of the exercises are related to the story, and some feel janky. I think a few of the exercises could be removed as they are similar and the whole thing tightened up. That being said playing with the last exercise gave me goose pumps . I dont know why but that was worth $3.. I would encourage this dev to keep going and mine the emotive aspects of VR ."
