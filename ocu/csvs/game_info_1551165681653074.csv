Get ready for an unforgettable adventure where discovery and excitement await at every turn. Very fun","All around it is a decent game. So far there are only 2 issues I have but they are both somewhat avoidable. #1 is collision on the elevator and train. If you are ""walking"" around the elevator or train and move into a surface, you get stuck unless you are able to move out using your irl environment. When you are on the elevator, it is quite time consuming which you have little of in the moment. #2 is the final gem for the gauntlet. It is kinda blinding when it appears and if you are using the gauntlet to punch the rocks, you run the risk of skimming over it and having to go through the cutscene again. It would be nice to just be able to keep the gem on the glove after unlocking the cutscene or stops its spawning.",Good night love I hope youâ€™re feeling well today and that youâ€™re having fun and that youâ€™re getting better I hope youâ€™re doing good and that youâ€™re feeling good and I love and I miss seeing your beautiful smile I hope youâ€™re feeling good and that you are doing good and that your family and friends know you love me I miss seeing them and you and Iâ€™m always thinking about them I miss seeing my friends I love them I love my kids I love my mom so very many people love my kids but they have so little friends that are just too old and so far and they have never seen a mom and they are so much more than I love them more like they have a good mom and they will be a family they will always be a family that they will be one that loves you more and they will be a good mother they will always have to live in,I love this game
