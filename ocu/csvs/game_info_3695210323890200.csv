I only got this game because BoneLab is taking so dang long, but this is a wonderful sub while Stress Level Zero gets their rear in gear. Some suggestions: Add blood when you stab a dummy, not just decapitate them. Be able to stab someone with an empty healing shot, not just a full one. Knife. Higher hatchet damage Lockers Human dummies. I do get the feeling that sales for this game are gonna TANK when BoneLab comes out, but this game will hold a special place in my heart forever",Don’t waste $40 of your allowance buying bonelab buy this there is no mods tho just sandbox… BUT WHO GIVES A CRAP ABOUT MODS so I recommend you buy this $10 game and buy something else with the rest of your money so one more thing I recommend y you turn on oil splat and dismemberment🩸cool game i play it every day that’s all go downthere for the cookie Mmm HERE IS DA COOKIE 🍪 🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪,"I really like this, it was good and works like bonelab and bonework, 10 out of 10, but it be really good with mods, a frying pan, a story mode, more guns, multiplayer, explosives, more maps, cosmetics, and a laying down animation, you press b and you crouch, hold b you lay down.","Very good and cool game, here are some suggestions:cars/vehicles, more gun options, more gun customization like scopes and extended mags and better blood/ink the blood should be customizable like to change the colour and more of a budget cuts type blood so the blood spews out instead of drips."
