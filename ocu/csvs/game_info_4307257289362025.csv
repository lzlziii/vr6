New guns, maps, zompies, and even more see you there 🫡",This game deserves 4 out of 5 stars imo I will list the pros and cons Pros -great customization for guns and vest layout -great graphics for quest -a ton of guns and attachments to choose from -great gun feel -a lot of pvp and single player maps -satisfying grenades and breaching tools -mg42 :) Cons -high grip sensitivity (if you have a sticky grip button that doesn't go out fully when you release the button irl 90% of the time your in-game character will keep hold of the item and you'll have to pull out the grip button irl to release in-game) -toxic community (pro tip gun them down) -only five attachments are allowed in multi-player) -multiplayer is slightly janky but its getting fixed -weapon sway is a bit too heavy making your character feel weak and your guns aren't very manageable (was reduced last update) Overall I recommend purchasing this on quest as a substitute for h3vr especially for the low 16$ price point.,Here is a list from of cool stuff to add 1. More multiplayer missions 2. Being able to pilot and drive vehicles besides the jets 3. More attachments like a heartbeat sensor? 4. A nuke Rocket Launcher Hey these are just a few things that I would enjoy playing reach out if you get a chance to🪖🇺🇸
