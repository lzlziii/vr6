Great job üëç. Please continue to add more gameplay, one suggestion is to have more maps and new colorful outdoor environments if possible. Allow to have longer play times, or unlimited time ‚è≤Ô∏è Thank you üôè.","While a competitor to QubeFall is always welcome, this game is unfortunately aggravating because the blocks often fall to areas on the ground that are well outside of your Guardian instead of accounting for it. They also come from two different angles that aren't anywhere near as predictable as QubeFall's spawn point, and they come way too fast for the game to be enjoyable. There is also no indicator of when the blocks on the floor will cause the game to end, such as a changing color aura or a faster beeping sound. They also don't even always connect to the grid and still fall even when they give a positional preview. The instant falling that they do, instead of floating in midair, is really jarring and kills the fun of figuring out positioning of blocks on the table. Just get QubeFall on SideQuest instead, until this is massively improved with way slower-moving blocks so that you can last for 15 min per session instead of 2.","As much as I love Cubism, it's a chill game. So chill that it can make ice cubes. Flickblocks is the anti-thesis of that. Not really a puzzler, but then again Tetris is a pseudo-puzzler. Combine the Zen like mood of Cubism and the frenetic pace of Tetris, then you'll get Flickblocks. There has to be some improvements though, to make this a 5-star game. Roomscale is limiting, and may turn off players who have limited space. Also, controllers are needed to a game that barely requires more than two buttons (one for each hand). If hand-tracking and non-roomscale option is added, then I can see this game as a must-have in your library, belonging to the ranks of Beat Saber and Pop:One.","It seems that it is made so that the block can not be reached unless it moves, but it is not very interesting. It's more fun to fall from directly above the table. The game is over when the blocks reach the blocks on the table.",Tetris with a twist
