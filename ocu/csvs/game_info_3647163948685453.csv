Tiny Castles,"Tiny Castles is an ""action puzzle game"" built from the ground up using hand-tracking. It's an experimental project developed internally at Oculus to test necessary interactions for a hands-only game experience. In the game, you play as a powerful god. The game's objective is simple - free your ""believers"" from the evil god and his minions and advance forward to destroy the obelisk which powers the evil in this world. The game was built to identify the types of game mechanics that could work well with hand-tracking. For this reason, it lacks real challenge and difficulty balancing and focuses more on showcasing a variety of hand interactions instead. Included is the ""Playground"" level which is the best place to experience all of the game mechanics in an isolated setting while the actual game levels demonstrate these mechanics in real game scenarios.",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale, Sitting","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Puzzle",English,0.9.10098,Meta Quest,Oculus,https://developer.oculus.com/blog/hand-tracking-in-tiny-castles/,"Mar 3, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3647163948685453/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3647163948685453&r=1, https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/?utm_source=www.oculus.com&utm_medium=oculusredirect",Terms of Service,1.85 GB,"Another example of a great little free app lab game with a lot of promise. Detailed, warm graphics, nice sound effects and music, cool ambience. Gameplay is a little on the simple side; some more advanced puzzles would be nice. At this point the ""puzzles"" are more of the point and click variety. Hand tracking works well in the premise of this game but is inconsistent. The lightning bolt action (pointing and thrusting forward two fingers) almost never works. I could also do without the aim assist when sending said lightning bolt or throwing a brick. As another reviewer pointed out, yes, the characters are kind of silly and comical, but come on...you're in a tiny castle after all! All in all, a really cool example of what hand tracking can do in VR, even if it does need some work. I'd love to see a full game come out of this.",This is a nice game controller is recommended as hand tracking loses sometimes there is a glitch where you can go to playground then move with joystick go to a level with hand menu then move around while loading then you can skip to the end all though the ice temple is hard because of the power it's not ranged so it's hard as it's fast paced but over all nice but there's a glitch where in playground if you go over the wall then move titan then it works you can hold him if you get him in the air use the attacks to get him down please don't patch these because they are so fun to do still reading? Thank you this game is also short story but replayability for all of them playground is better as has more fun in it and to use ice slam it on the ground for lightning make a gun shape with 2 fingers then push fire is a ðŸ¤˜ sign for controller b for fire a for lightning and please add more this is great greater if there is more levels if it's hard to make levels I understand plus it's new but hand gui is hard to use because it has to be presice hand movement just put hand out can be used in moss with the guardians and in playground although much space the oculus has 200gb of space so it's fair as so much in playground and it's in applab don't expect a lot of updates as oculus didn't make a full realease yet that's what applabs for thank you for reading and please don't abuse the glitches as it can be reported it's fine to use them once or twice but doing everytime is bad 4 out of 5 because it has no updates YET so it's nice 5 when more levels and playground levels realease watch a video on YouTube for tutorials,"Hi, I think it would be awesome to have random generated levels , soo it's not the same level ever time",More content,"I absolutely love this game. I just hope they make more levels. If they did I would play this so much, it is also really amazing with the hand tracking."
