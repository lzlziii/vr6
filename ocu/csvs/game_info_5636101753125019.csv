(still in development) but i think everyone should support because this game will be wayyyyy better in the future and i think this will be successful so like play the game it’s amazing!","I was kicked Out Of The Glad Guild Group Cuz The owner (PixelGTAG) wanted to kill me in the Glad Guild SMP For ‘Content’, The Server was then ruined so i said to everyone how it was now bad, Pixel Is A Toxic Person And I Wouldn’t Recommend Supporting His Game, Also His Mods On This Game Will Just Randomly Kick Or Ban You Because They Are Literal 4 Year olds Bro","The owner of this game (pixelGTAG) is a predator, please do not support this horrible person. (also this game sucks)",I like it bc I’m part of the mod team and clurr is like a slay queen
