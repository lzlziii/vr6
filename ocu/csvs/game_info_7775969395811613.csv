Backrooms VR,"This a small-ish backrooms VR game that uses the gorilla tag locomotion (because I was too lazy to write my own locomotion) where you can explore the backrooms level 0, level 1, and the poolrooms. Be careful though as there are entities that really don't like you.",7+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Horror",English,0.6,WCDuck Games,WCDuck Games,https://jacksonchaos175.wixsite.com/duck-s-games,"Aug 10, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/7775969395811613/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=7775969395811613&r=1, https://jacksonchaos175.wixsite.com/duck-s-games/privacy-policy",524.3 MB,This game is honestly the best backrooms game out there! The only think is that you said multiplayer is coming soon… ITS BEEN 9 MONTHS yeah. Also jman made a video with multiplayer meaning the dev can add it but is too lazy,The game is really great and has great potential but you need to add more levels and give the pool room an exit I found a glitch with the howler when you go as low as possible basically to the ground the howler can't get you and your still able to move to the exit,Please and I said please make a multiplayer because its way to scary without players. I was so scared that I didnt even want to leave spawn. So please make a multiplayer thank you.,Your game is very fun but one thing I’m not saying your game is bad but everyone is saying how fun exploration mode is but why am I not allowed to play it it just says coming soon on exploration mode and I’m clicking it so just respond to this review and tell me if I’m doing anything wrong because how do I play exploration mode? Please tell me.,After a long time duck announced Multiplayer is out for Pcvr we just have to wait for Quest support for Multiplayer
