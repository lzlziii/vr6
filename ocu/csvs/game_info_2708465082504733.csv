Part 2 is way better than part 1, but near the end gets kinda of frustrating. The pteranodons were a pain. Loved everything else. Definitely worth it, but the developers NEED to add a scene select feature once completed so we can play certain parts again without having to play the entire story. You will get more and better reviews if you give it replay value. EDIT: It's been over a year now. Any word on a possible update for splitting the chapters up into smaller sections so we can choose to replay certain scenes from the main menu?","I know I probably shouldn't use reviews for questions, but I can't figure out what it means. Is it a collection of parts one and two, or does it mean something else entirely? Side note. What caused the crashes? I just wanted to know. Another side note. LOVED the game it was perfect, and after a while, I treated the raptors like pets they were like family to me. The game is the perfect amount of ""AAAAAAAAAH OH GOD A RAPTOR"" and the perfect amount of "" look at wonderful detailing and animation."" All in all, it's a wonderful game. I would play a whole 4 or 5 game series. Thank you, coatsink. Thank you.",It is so fun hiding from raptors and the horror when you get caught. It is especially fun when you are speed running the game so you have to go fast. The other Dino’s make the game so much better and the end make me crying. Definitely worth the money spent!,It is a very great game I wish they would make a chapter 3 or a second Jurassic world game because this is the only one it is still a great game but I think they could make a second Jurassic world game.,"Just played through the game for the second time (second-and-a-half time, actually, since I played through the first chapter before the second came out and then started over once it did), and I have to say the game definitely holds up! Graphics are stylized of course, but because the game isn't going for photorealism, it's able to give you some pleasing light and shadow effects that really enhance the atmospheric quality of the environment as you make your way through the deserted facility in your attempt to survive and escape the island. As an added bonus, if you elect not to use the crouch button you'll get a fair amount of exercise getting down to duck behind cover, crawl through vents, or to just make yourself as inconspicuous as possible when the raptors are hunting you (and then scurrying to your feet so you can sprint at full speed when they find you). It's not one of those games that leaves you exhausted and drenched in sweat by the time you're done, but I'm sure I burned a few calories playing it."
