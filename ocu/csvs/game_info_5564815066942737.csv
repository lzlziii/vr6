As others mentioned, rendering and moving videos to your headset may be more work then some people are looking for - but if you have the time and interest it’s awesome!","Rating this four stars as it's a great app, but there's a lot more development and support that needs to happen to really make this something everyone can enjoy and not just the experimental virtual hacker crowds. The developer is very active on the discord and takes feedback and suggestions seriously.",Great movie player. Can't wait to be able to watch 3D movies in 6dof when that feature is added to the converter.,watch only mode so good !
