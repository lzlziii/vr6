I played through a few dungeons and enjoyed it. I did think it was funny how the characters spoke, the spells were fun, the ones I got to try anyway. But the reason Iâ€™m giving this game a two stare review instead of a four or even five star review, is because after about the third quest my guardian was all over the place. My headset would lose tracking every five minutes or less. Most of the time I would need to exit the game, make a new guardian, and Launch the game again only to restart the mission I was on, and start from the beginning. At first I thought it was a problem with my headset, so I restarted it, and tried again only to have the same problem occur over and over again. Eventually I got the tracking to work, but then the quest I was on broke, in the little book you have there is a page that tells you what your objective is. Well it told me to go talk to the mayor, but when I got there he wouldnâ€™t talk to me, so I went back to the guy who gave me this quest in the first place, and he told me to investigate a castle, but I already did that, and nothing happened if I was to go back by I tried. So I was stuck between two different objectives with no way of progressing with the story. So I restarted the mission entirely, only for my tracking to go all haywire again. After restarting my headset again the tracking was still all over the place so I played a different game and then the tracking was fine. If I could get past this mission and keep playing the game, it would be a four or five star game, but because of this bug, I was only able to play half the game, so it gets half the rating.","I absolutely love this game, from talking to NPCs to battling creatures and completing quests. This is a definite recommend. Only thing I wish it had was Achievements!","Visit linktr,ee/gaving7095 for 25 % off many Oculus titles ðŸ˜€ This is a fun retro-style dungeon crawler / RPG style game. I would say there are better examples of the genre on Quest & overall itâ€™s kinda forgettable so not worth the full 5 stars from me. The low price saves it from getting 3 stars.",One of the better first person adventure titles for VR. Great retro aesthetic.,"I played this all day at my friend's house and could not wait to get home and play it on my own computer. This game is from the same people who did shock troops and theta legion so I was expecting a lot and I was not disappointed! I love the retro graphics, the medieval environment, all the spells, gameplay etc etc. The guys at garage collective know how to have fun and make fun games, end of story."
