Thumper,"Thumper is rhythm violence: classic rhythm-action, blistering speed, and brutal physicality. You are a space beetle. Brave the hellish void and confront a maniacal giant head from the future. Scream down the endless track and crash through punishing obstacles with simple, airtight controls. Hurtle forward, master new moves, reach overwhelming velocities, and survive epic boss battles. Every crushing impact is interwoven with a pounding original soundtrack. To reach synesthetic bliss, you must go through rhythm hell. * Nine levels of Rhythm Hell * Adrenalizing Boss Battles * Simple Controls: one stick and one button * Psychedelic Visuals * Original Soundtrack by Brian Gibson of noise-rock band Lightning Bolt",7+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Music & Rhythm","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French (Canada), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Mexico), Swedish, Turkish",1.00,Drool LLC,Drool LLC,http://thumpergame.com/,"May 21, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/1854124104686464/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=1854124104686464&r=1, https://thumpergame.com/tos-and-privacy-policy",Terms of Service,410.2 MB,"This game is balls to the wall...in your face. Best first person tunnel vision on what could be seen as an absolute ride through Hell. Rhythm games may prepare ones senses, however a full VR rig with headphones playing this game--BAM! Great job devs, I will say no more.","I first bought this game and then refunded it. But the next day I had to buy it again. This game has a spiritual connection. I needed to feel my-self flowing through the universe and battling these entities. It’s weird the triangle is just a shape, but yet it has being to it. A god like being. That you connect with as you send your shock ball towards it exploding it with your power. I like how this is a game that you can play in bed. You don’t swing your arms just press the buttons. A relaxing yet enjoyable intense game.","Amazing game To get a dis count use lin ktr,ee/megadis count (replace , with . and remove space)!!",www oculus com /app re ferrals /LJWHJ/1854124104686464,"Thumper for the Quest 2 is an adrenaline-packed masterpiece that's redefining gaming experiences.

With stunning visuals, immersive soundscapes, and pulse-pounding gameplay, it's undoubtedly the best game I've played on the Quest 2.
