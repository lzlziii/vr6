The Cat Way,"""The Cat Way is an immersive VR game that takes players to a future world where cats have become cybernetic animals. Players play as the main characters, a cyborg and his cat drone, who find themselves in mysterious rooms filled with challenging puzzles and dangers. One of the main aspects of the game is the use of VR technologies that allow players to fully immerse themselves in the world of the game, feel its atmosphere and become a part of this story. Players can explore each room, find hidden keys, and solve complex puzzles that require logic, observation, and ingenuity. The main characters have unique abilities and skills that help them overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. The cybernetic cat can move quickly and easily by jumping and climbing, and the cyborg can perform basic functions. In addition to challenging puzzles, the game also contains other dangers, such as traps, laser beams, moving platforms, and much more. Players must be very careful not to fall into the trap and successfully complete each level. ""The Cat Way"" is a great choice for those who like challenging puzzles, adventures, and the latest technologies. Thanks to VR technologies, the game allows players to fully immerse themselves in the world of puzzles.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Adventure, Puzzle",English,1.1,LandS Studio,LandS Studio,https://www.thecatway.com.ua/,"Mar 22, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5796924910389253/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5796924910389253&r=1, https://www.thecatway.com.ua/privacypolicy.html",345.0 MB,"Interesting game concept and good idea, already relatively well implemented and fun to play. I don't know anything similar in VR, which is rare. The cat helps to solve puzzles by reaching areas where you cannot go. With this, she can bring things that you cannot retrieve yourself or trigger switches. The game and puzzles are physics-based, and that works quite well already. However, it still needs a lot of work. I got stuck with my hand a few times and couldn't free it, so I had to respawn. These issues need to be resolved. Controlling the cat is also not easy and could be improved. Additionally, it took me a long time to figure out how to shoot a bow (Tip: Grab the arrow at the very back and put it in the bow). Currently, it's more like a demo in terms of scope, but this demo is enjoyable. I hope new levels and updates will be added to make it a truly great puzzle game. Is it worth the $4.99? Currently, no, there's not enough content, it's too short, and there are some bugs and relatively easy puzzles. Traps, laser beams, and moving platforms mentioned in the description were not present (probably still in development). However, if you want to try an interesting game concept, enjoy puzzle games, and want to support the developer, it's worth a try."
