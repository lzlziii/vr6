QOR (QuestORama),"Inspired by Dactyl Nightmare and Tron, you are the computer virus, sent by nefarious hackers to take down a server from the inside. Use rocket jumps, grappling hooks, and climbing to quickly dart around each Node of the server, stealing every bit of data you can before bringing the whole thing down. Procedural generation of the levels and enemies keeps every fight new and fresh. Slow down time mid-flight for insane maneuvers and Hollywood movie-style gun fights. Buy upgrades, modify your weapons, crack puzzles, and more in this Retro Tron-esque world on the other side of the computer screen.

I first picked it up when it was still on SideQuest and not App Lab. The problem is with Quest O Rama is that as soon as people see it they immediately get displeased and just drop it after a couple sessions. Sure it definitely does have bugs and problems nor the best looks but after playing it for a while you realize that it gets better the more you play. Once you go down a few levels you'll start fighting bosses that are genuine tests to your strength. Also the secret cassettes and tapes that you can find give you a real ""Aha!"" moment. The bugs and glitches and overall performance could do better but it's a very promising game with lots of potential.","Got stuck at reloading the clip to weapon instruction at the start, reinstalled the game, deleted game files, still not working, then I jump right into the game skipping the instructions, have no idea what I am suppose to do.",QOR is amazing but confusing at times. Give this game a try it's a lot of fun. Really the only confusing thing is the story but not every good game needs a story.,I think it cured my cancer!,You can somehow know exactly what's happening without understanding any of it. It is...something.
