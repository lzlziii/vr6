Gorilla Tag,"Reject Humanity. Run, climb, and jump in VR using a unique locomotion method that only needs the movement of your hands and arms. No buttons, no sticks, no teleportation. Push off of surfaces to jump and squeeze them with both hands to climb. There are four different game modes - From simple Tag, for up to 3 players, or infection mode, with 4 or more. The Hunt game mode gives you a unique personal target to chase down. Paintbrawl is a team vs. team paintball battle using slingshots. Run from the other gorillas, or outmaneuver the survivors to catch them. Parkour up trees and cliff faces to evade and chase monke down. Hang out in a virtual jungle with randos or group up in a private room with friends to hang out and play. The stakes are low, so feel free to just chat or make up your own games. The movement is easy to learn, and hard to master. Crossplay with the PC versions of the game, so play with anyone on any platform. There are six different levels to explore. Each with their own topography that form routes and obstacles to play on. Visit our store in the City, with a rotating inventory of items to buy, play with, and wear to express your true monke.

It's like you're slowly turning into a monkey while you play it! Sure it might take a bit to get used to the controls but after you get used to it it's really fun! I think my favorite part about it is that you can fly like the wind on the trampolines and ropes if you really try. It's also a great workout! 5 stars would recommend! You found the secret monke party!!! 🐵 🍌 🐒 🪩 🎉 🍌 🐒 🐵🍌 🐵 🐒 Click the helpfull button if you found this!!!,This game is so much fun me and my friends have so much fun and I get to be a gorilla ╱▔▔▔▔▔╲⠀⠀⠀ ⠀╱⠀⠀╱▔╲╲╲▏⠀⠀⠀ ╱⠀⠀╱━╱▔▔▔▔▔╲━╮⠀⠀ ▏⠀▕┃▕╱▔╲╱▔╲▕╮┃⠀⠀ ▏⠀▕╰━▏▊▕▕▋▕▕━╯⠀⠀ ╲⠀⠀╲╱▔╭╮▔▔┳╲╲⠀⠀⠀ ⠀╲⠀⠀▏╭━━━━╯▕▕⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀╲⠀╲▂▂▂▂▂▂╱╱⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀▏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀╲⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀▏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀▕╲⠀⠀╲ ⠀╱▔╲▏⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀▕╱▔╲▕ ⠀▏ ⠀⠀⠀╰⠀⠀⠀⠀╯⠀⠀⠀▕▕ ⠀╲⠀⠀⠀╲⠀⠀⠀⠀╱⠀⠀⠀╱⠀╲ ⠀⠀╲⠀⠀▕▔▔▔▔▏⠀⠀╱╲╲╲▏ ⠀╱▔⠀⠀▕⠀⠀⠀⠀▏⠀⠀▔╲▔▔ ⠀╲▂▂▂╱⠀⠀⠀⠀╲▂▂▂╱⠀,"Honestly, I spent way too much time in my life for this game.
