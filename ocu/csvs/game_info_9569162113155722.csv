This is where the replay value is. I need that faster time and it's addictive especially if you think you got a fast time but if you hit any of the red hostages you will instantly scream out loud like I did nooooo F*********k and you start from the beginning again. The pressure of the timer that you don't see till the end is a nice touch as you don't know till the end what your time is, so every second counts and you know it as you play Would be 5stars if maybe a leaderboard or something but for a demo it's fine EDIT: ***THE FULL GAME IS NOW FREE ON SIDE QUEST ***",Just wow blew me away
