But the Menu it's very bad, sometimes when i want Open a door i grab the gun or bullets accidentally. Another thing is when you take the bullets accidentally, is imposible put away again. Just you can reload the pistol or left behind the bullets The IA of the killer can be better. The locomotion shadows around the eyes is veeeery big and ruins the experience a bit. I ike the Game but feel it like is not finished. I hope the developer bring some updates to make it better.","House Of The Butcher is a game where you must solve puzzles in order to escape the serial killer. It takes some critical thinking and finesse to escape! This game is well rounded but do not expect a horror game. While the environment creates a tense and creepy atmosphere, there is no jump scares. The Butcher is a bit of a dummy and is fairly easy to get around as well. The big thing about this game is the use of the environments to create a ""saw"" type puzzles in which you need to solve before the butcher comes barreling toward you. There is ammo for your gun laid throughout the house and there is plenty of it if you hit all your shots to stun the killer. Overall the game feels pretty good besides a few hiccups I had with the UI when trying to stow bullets but kept grabbing my flashlight. The game also does not have smooth turning but does have smooth locomotion, kind of odd to not have both. The game is worth the download and can be easily beat in about 20 mins or so if you know all the puzzles. It took me about 40 my first playthrough. Give it a try and escape as soon as you can! Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ4cInp4VX4","This game reminded me of the first Resident Evil with a mansion. The butcher will constantly try to kill you, but you can deal with him with a little skill. There are enough ammo, although they need to be looked for. But I liked swinging the ax more, real hardcore. I finished the game in 2 hours, I totaly recommend it.",I like the it's so scary to play I like the jump scares I love the game I like the guy in it he's very scary,"Pretty scary with a scent if drama, recommend to every re series lovers üëç"
