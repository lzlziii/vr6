HyperTunnel,"HyperTunnel® enables multi-dimensional collaboration between frontline workers and experts on demand – from remote physical worksites to centralized immersive digital twins. We 3D scan a remote worksite and create an immersive digital twin. We use AI/ML to recognize and match specific objects found at the worksite, and augment the XR shared space with corresponding interactive 3D models. These interactive models are used by the experts, immersed in the VR digital twin, to guide and demonstrate how to perform tasks on-site. We also leverage the digital twins as immersive VR simulators for training.",12+,Multiplayer,"Roomscale, Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,", Productivity",English,"2023.2.1
