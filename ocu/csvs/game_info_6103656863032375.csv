But then the game started getting so many remakes to the point it got boring. It was good but at-last, all things must come to an end.",W game,"Let’s get on with the basic stuff. First, good maps have been destroyed. Almost every model is copied off of either GTag or Capuchin, which is getting a remake. My brother has invited me to the game, which was 1 year ago, and this happened. The game is closed. Maybe try something else, creator.","It was good when I joined in January, then the new map update kinda ruined it so I stopped playing and now I see that Hilo shut it down",If I become a mod I will help the games community and help by giving out idea's in discord???? I will be really glad if I become a mod and would really help out the community. Goodbye hopefully I will become a mod
