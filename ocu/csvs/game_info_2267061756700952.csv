It‚Äôs not as fast as the other racing games on quest 2, but I still recommend it. The boost system is not the best when it comes to limitation, I think it at least could charge up over time. This is a good stay in position kind of game, and i recommend the game.",I think this game is realy good and it was only ¬£5.99 Looked at all the bad reviews and thought about not getting it glad I did now üëç
