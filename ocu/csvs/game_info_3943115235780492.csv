ModernArcheryVR,"An old Chinese poet said,. Ideas come up when you're riding a horse, sleeping, or defecating. Good ideas come when you're focused on something else. Also, it's better to think in a large space than in a small room. Here is a VR game where you shoot an arrow at a target in a big space. Would you like to try this game to come up with a good idea? Also, all the sales of this game will be the cost of the designer of the next VR game we are preparing. Please buy it for our next game.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Sports","English, Japanese",0.1,ouka-ichi-mon,ouka-ichi-mon.inc,https://oukaichimon.com/,"Jul 2, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3943115235780492/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3943115235780492&r=1, https://oukaichimon.com/PrivacyPolicy/PrivacyPolicyA.html",209.4 MB,"Game lacks of things to do apart from being good shooting. Apex Construct archery competition is far more entertaining, and if you don't need targets and points, In Death will be much much more enjoyable. But the main problem here (and it could be corrected at least) is the bow mechanics itself, all the direction control is made with the left (front) hand, the one at the bow, not the cord... But in archery it is exactly the opposite! Even the slightest direction change of the front hand makes the arrow deviates meters on long shots. All other archery games uses the right (cord) hand to control direction and using the other hand as pivot, not perfect but much more realistic. That makes the shooting experience estrange, unreal and steals all your immersion. Then grabbing the cord and pulling fails A LOT, the grabbing point is either too small or activates whenever it wants, which adds more problems to the mechanics. I know the purpose of the game is to financially support the next game... but this game is really unsatisfactory for the price and purpose.",Let's see
