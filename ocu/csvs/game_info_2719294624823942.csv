Myst,"Welcome to Myst: a starkly beautiful island, eerily tinged with mystery and shrouded in intrigue. Journey to Myst Island and other stunning, long dormant locations - called “Ages”- and begin to unravel the mystery you have been thrust into. As you learn what happened on the island, you will find that you are playing a key role in an epic story whose ending has not yet been written. Explore deeper connections in these stunning and surreal Ages, uncover a story of ruthless family betrayal, and make choices that will affect both you, and the world of Myst itself. Cyan, the indie studio that created the beloved classic, has reimagined Myst. Built from the ground up to play in VR, Myst is teeming with new art, new sound, re-imagined interactions, and even optional puzzle randomization. Finally... the highly anticipated Myst VR experience has arrived! UPDATE: April 4th, 2023: Please note that due to newer Meta software updates preventing the support of new features for Quest 1 moving forward, and our desire to make sure Myst supports the latest and greatest software & hardware, we must cease Quest 1 support in Myst on October 1st, 2023.

It's a faithful port and honestly the experience is incredible. Puzzles are really fun in VR, it's an amazing trip down memory lane, it's a blast. I really love this game. However, I am subtracting a whopping two stars for the world's biggest oversight. Who did not use a notepad to play this game on the computer? Nobody, right? We ALL had to write things down! So why on earth is there no virtual notepad to keep notes about the puzzles on? Like I'm seriously supposed to just remember everything? I tried taking pictures and it limits you to a tiny amount of pictures! So what I have to go into the real world to take down notes and then go back into the virtual world? No way.","Myst is without a doubt a 5 star game, but this VR adaptation feels somewhat neglected and the implementation feels lazy in places - especially for the standards we have come to expect from Cyan. The VR version took over a year to receive the long-promised ""notes"" update, but it actually wasn't a note update at all. We got a clunky photo management mode that breaks immersion and feels awkwardly thrown together. Its clear that they neither did any user testing with this faux ""note"" mode, nor did they prioritize the implementation of it (it took over a year). I'm still waiting for a fix for the fix, but updates seem so infrequent that I'm afraid this implementation will forever be good, but not great.","Nostalgia is a powerful force, I tells ya. And I must say, I did enjoy feeling like I'm actually standing in the library. Two minor marks against it: First, realMyst had day/night cycles, and I was kind of hoping this game would too. Or that it would rain in the Stoneship age. Second, playing with hand tracking is kinda fun, and the feature is good enough for movement, pushing buttons and pulling levers, but it struggles when it comes to turning dials and holding things. For the chest puzzle in Stoneship, and any puzzle involving a book, I had to pick up the controllers. Also, I never got my home background. Maybe because I bought the game in a bundle? EDIT to respond: I did, in fact, contact Meta support. They said YOU should be able to help.","Being new to VR and Myst, I had a bit of a rough start but with a little nudge from the devs I got going and omg this is THE best puzzle game I have ever played! The graphics combined with the challenges, spectacular! Highly recomnend!","Nice game about graphics. Maybe I was young when I played it before (on pc), but puzzles seem a lot easier. However, they're still challenging and as quality puzzle games can be hard to find in VR, still worth the investment. Hopefully Riven will come out next."
