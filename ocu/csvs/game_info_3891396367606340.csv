So my Question to the devs is if the single player mode is actually a finished product? Please say yes so i can still play while avoiding being trash talked by kids 35 years younger than me. PS I pondered dropping a star(but for the greater good this game needs 5 stars) for how incredibly uncomfortable the club dance floor scene made me. literally the most horrific dancing by people i would describe as world class ugly and then never being able to get the bartender to come to the darkside with me under the guise of ""Freedom"" when in reality i just want the hook up on free drinks. Love this game","Fun game but it makes me log in every time I go to play and that is annoying. It takes so long to type in vr! I like the iron man feel, and it is a fun concept.","A very great game. I love the spider man/iron man feel. Pretty Good story. Love the missions and npc interactions. Would play it even without the tag, race and other game modes","Picture this, your a combination of iron man and spider man flying/swinging around a dystopian city while playing a game of freezetag. Literally the most fun I’ve had in a vr game. 100/10 would play again",ITS SO FUN… but there’s not as many people as I would like so everyone if you see plz get the game
