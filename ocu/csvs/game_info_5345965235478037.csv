The dealer got black Jack 3 times in a row. And besides that he only got 18 and over every single time. If you want to loose your mind and want to punch a whole throw your wall then play this game.,Amazing game! Easy to use and runs smooth.,"I like the game and the Smokey atmosphere, and would play it more if you could multiplayer for friends. Sometimes late at night, I just want a few games with my friend/s not a random person. Lastly, selecting the chips amount could be made easier. It’s a good hangout game.","Love logging into this seedy joint, you can almost smell the mild and old smoke, have made some great friends and thankfully not to many kids","If you go to the slot machine, and set it to Auto-Spin, all ya gotta do is wait patiently til it hits on something and you win. At this point, quickly hit the button to stop the auto-spin. Then continue hitting this stop button, and keep adding to your total $$$. As your balance grows, you can gradually up your wager so when the Stop button stops working, you can start auto spinning again and eventually win a larger amount. Eventually something will hit. And then you can collect the winnings many, many times just by hitting that stop button many, many times. I got my total over 5 million over the course of just a few days by doing this. Hehehe..."
