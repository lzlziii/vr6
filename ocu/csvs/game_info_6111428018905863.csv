This game is simple, silly and so much fun! It is addicting, you'll never get that song out of your head! It does have progressions that keeps the game getting tougher and faster as you move on. Be aware of your surroundings because things pop up on your sides and behind you.","Set in a Swiss chalet, with a funfair type of shooting gallery. Hilarious yodelling music and cute graphics. Swivel around and shoot various other objects like the cuckoo clock and beer tankered to activate them. An array of achievements to be had too. Great watching the Swiss man gradually climb the mountain each time you hit the wrong targets which include the pop up Swiss maidens. When the man reaches the summit its game over, thus providing an interesting and fun way to end the game. The longer you survive the more different types of targets appear adding to the interest. The type of game where you have to have 'just one more turn'. Well done the developers for a producing a novel twist on a carnival shooting game. In my opinion you can't go wrong for the price."
