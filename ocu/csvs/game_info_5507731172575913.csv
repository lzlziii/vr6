Beware, some bonuses are good, others are not! Also, keep track of flying bonuses, those are the special ones. Feeling good? Try the Survival chamber, at the pyramid's lower level. Resist as long as you can.. or taste the heated lava! Have local scores for you and your family. Also compete with other Oculus players in the general leaderboard! Be the best!

Graphics are top notch. Like the whole concept of this. Great work by the devs to create a first class game and such a great price. Treat yourself. well worth it!!!!,"Great Game, but please add a colorblind option. Edit: Wow! Thanks for the Update! That was fast! :) The new designs helps alot!","It's an interesting take on an old classic. The gameplay is smooth and actually adds a few interesting twists to the gameplay formula. If I were to fault it, I would say it's a little too short, but you can extend the play time in survival mode.","Great graphics. Lots of fun with some challenge. Coming from a year of playing Zooma, I'm still getting used to the aiming but a must-have for marble shooter fans!"
