Maybe items like new toys or treats or even clothing for the pets? Would be nice! Kinsale like those pet games that were on the ps vita. Play fetch with them? Maybe be able to redecorate the room. Go shopping for supplies with them?be able to teach them some tricks using voice commands. This game would be fantastic üëåüèº",The devs completely abandoned the game because There weren't enough players don't buy no more updates EDIT: they responded with a smiley face new pets VR coming? It's been awhile since a update for a game so I don't know if there just saying that I bumped up the review,"‚Ä¶both pets are stuck showing the ‚Äûzzz‚Äú over their heads and won‚Äôt do anything any more. Developers seem to have abandoned the game too. @ Devs, Doesn‚Äôt get better after latest updates. Same thing evertime we restart.","I have never played this game, it was gotten for my 6 year old daughter. She loves it. This and Rec Room are her favorites. She is able to play with minimal assistance from me (normally when I don‚Äôt set the height for her and she needs to be picked up to get something). It holds her attention and I hear her laughing when she plays. What more can you ask for when it comes to entertainment?","Great concept, but for our first dog after playing for a while he just sits there barking at us, with a sponge over his head. Tried everything to get him into the bath, getting sponge wet, soaped, tried cleaning him on the spot, tried attracting him with toys, scratching him, etc. He just walks to different areas of the house and barks with the sponge icon above his head. Buggy. Had my kid start a new game, hopefully the dog isn't broken this time..."
