HomeVR,"Home VR, powered by ImagineX, is the first real estate platform to experience unbuilt properties worldwide in VR. Through our APP, you can walk through and customize, whenever possible, non-existing properties from around the world. Also, you can contact realtors, brokers, or developers directly and schedule a joint tour of the property. From now on, there's no need to waste time going to the properties and doing mind tricks when you can have it all from your own home. Welcome to the future of Real Estate! . If you want your project to be uploaded to our APP, please use the following service: https://homevr.imagine-x.co/.

Having the option to walk into a unbuilt place, with a 1:1 scale to better understand spaces it makes it very simple to buy or rent anywhere in the world and from anywhere in the world. If you havenâ€™t done so, you have to try it!","You can walk through places based in real -life spaces, and it shows you where they are located.","Loving this type of app, I think this one doesn't reach enough. After all, the environment is cold and unwelcoming, above all the resolution has been drastically reduced, it is also on this, it makes everything unpleasant to the eyes, to worsen the situation even the only slow and boring locomotion system, without the possibility of greater speed or teleport to avoid the boredom of slow movements. Given the scaled graphics it is not even tempting to download the other environments. There is certainly much better out there, such as Mixeal Apartment or the newer Reality Viewer","When it comes to walking through and experiencing properties in VR, this is the APP to go."
