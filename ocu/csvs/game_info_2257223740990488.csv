I've been struggling with learning the hand controls, having dyslexia sucks üòÜ. I've been learning to use my hands instead. I really enjoy messing around with this game. I really like the fact that people are so welcoming to me. I let them know I'm new right off the bat. People show or tell me how to do this or that. I'm looking forward to getting to know the controls better. Love that I can sit and watch if I want. I've had some fun conversations in several games. Thanks again Sv Rhiannon ‚ù§Ô∏è‚òÆÔ∏èüåç~üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è",Discord mods and devs are lazy can‚Äôt respond for days. I say shut the game down there‚Äôs no point in having it if they can‚Äôt help us get are account logins. They ask for a password if you accidentally log out when it doesn‚Äôt ask for one when you first install it. Terrible team of moderators and devs.,"This games USED to be a blast but due to the amped up AI moderator, i dont think i can even think something without getting banned‚Ä¶ seems tgey are mostly worries about the children on the game. It is poker, so i feel like there should be a MATURE audience that actually knows how to play & doesnt spend the whole time going all in before the flop bc they are clueless. why is thos game all of a sudden so worried about what kids hear at a poker table? maybe their parents should be more worried about it, that way everyone else can continue having fun w/o certain suspension‚Ä¶ i quit poker stars bc of kids & it seems this one might be nextüòû CAN THE ADULTS HAVE JUST ONE GAMBLING GAME THAT THEY CAN ACT LIKE ADULTS AT THE CASINO NOT CHURCH??","I got on this game last year and it looked too new, I thought I'd wait for new features and updates to the way stuff looks... anyways a year later and it looks like the same old boring game. Plus everyone seems like they are afraid to speak cause they'll get banned? Idk what kinda non sense this is but if this game really does just ban people for talking then that's lame, but also it's just Texas hold em. There's no craps, blackjack, baccarat, roulette, nothing. This games algorithm seems legit compared to pokerstars, just wish they had craps or something and the developers didn't seem so lazy. Add craps and let people swear and talk like men and it'd be a 5/5.","I've been having trouble with signing in to my profile. It pops up another name, which I haven't signed in to before, and it won't let me reset it because my controller is broken. I have hand tracking on, and this game's the only one i love to play that will actually work. If there's any fix you guys can help me with, I would appreciate it. Thank you!"
