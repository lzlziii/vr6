Marla - Masters of Malfunction,"Grab your safety helmet, put on your harness and head out to sea. 35km off the coast of RÃ¼gen lies the offshore wind farm where you can train your skills in fault diagnosis and maintenance. Armed with a multimeter, screwdriver and cleaning rag, you accompany Alex to a wind turbine. Together you master the eight steps of fault diagnosis. After the successful first mission, you are then on your own to prove yourself as the ""Master of Malfunction"" and professionally fix the next faults. MARLA is an educational game to train fault diagnosis skills for mechanical, electrical and hydraulic faults. It was developed for use in vocational school lessons by trainees in metal and electrical engineering. Here they learn maintenance and repair on a complete offshore wind turbine - directly in the classroom.
