It keeps saying to set my weight, but the number pad does not work to enter my weight. How do I fix this?",New game similar to the other rhyming fitness apps but different exciting music and being able to play while listening to your music of choice is a huge bonus.,I bought this today after seeing the brilliant reviews but so far I can’t see what the hype is as after I play one game on easy mode I can’t play a game straight after as it doesn’t reload I’ve got to quit the game 2-3 times until I can play again. I will give a review in about a weeks time hopefully it’ll be a better one. Can anyone tell me why I can’t play a game straight after playing again without quitting the game to open the game again to play? It’s says you can keep a record of your calories on an app on android. Does anyone know what the app is & where available Thanks Liz,"As the title says, you can have a nice chunk of time working out with this app because of it’s feature that you can add any music track and automatically makes you the map and it’s beats. I really enjoy it and will be expending more time on it!","Great for fun or exercise. Wonderful graphics. Different backgrounds. Custom music. I liked playing each if the 5 levels from easy which was slower up to god mode which went much quicker. Bonus, it keeps track of calories burned!"
