It's a very tough game and it does have an addictive quality. I do want to keep coming back to it for one more go after i fail. There are a few small problems that stop it from being great. You are not given enough info about what the powerups do or what penalties you can pick up and how to remove them from your ship, so you are left a bit confused in the beginning. Also, the ship does lag behind your hand movements. If the Devs can massively reduce the lag with the controls then i will change my score to 5 stars.","I bought this a while ago, and never gave it the attention it deserved. Completed stage one, and then......wow!!!!! That's when the game truly comes into its glory. This game is so addictive, and visually beautiful. Totally immersive. One of my top 5 games. The whole game has a very slick style too it, and is very satisfying to play. If I had to give one criticism, it would have to be I want more of it! Please please please add more levels. This should be on the main store. And way more polished than many other space shooters on the main store. This is a superbly executed space shooter.",Great game. Wish there was an expansion for more missions. Is that coming soon?,"A gem that should be in the main store. Devs, where is the Pause button? The campaigns are long. Sometimes you need to answer the phone or door!","I played the demo of David yesterday, after a long pause of months... And again, i am surprised how much fun it is. Blasting space ships, trying to beat my highscore. Played on my old Quest 1 and works super."
