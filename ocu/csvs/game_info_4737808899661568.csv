Once you get the hang of how the grapples work, you can be swinging lightspeed. I think there should be more backgrounds and color palettes. It would also be cool if there were better game modes, for instance, one where you have to dodge lethal cubes. Final thing, is the music. I don't like how you can only choose from two different songs.","I suppose. Probably not the best grappler, I dunno. I liked it.",I don't get very far I don't know it's me but there's not enough time to grab or the grabber don't work well. Need a update.
