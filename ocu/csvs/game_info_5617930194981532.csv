I will NEVER kick/ban people who aren’t doing bad things. I will only kick/ban people if they are doing a REALLY bad thing, like glitching into the mod vents, or saying bad slurs. I will only use my moderator for reasonable stuff. Most of the time, I will just play around until I’m supposed to kick/ban people. I do have moderator experience. So please, may i have mod? (Ps, the game is really fun! I hope you add more stuff..)",Yo polar chase is the best and the owner did a good job on that and your gonna ask why do u want to be a Moderator because I want to help the team and I wanna help u guys with the horror mod so pls Can I have a application to be a moderator￼￼ pls polar chase my discord user is rufus12345k😖 ok bye,Hey owner of polar Chase I really really like the game it's really good it has good physics and good graphics the player model is good it must have took a long time for you to make that game and the moderator vents I really wish I could go into because I don't have moderator in any other game and it's really sad because I really want to test out moderator and I would be really really nice with it but if I see any person being rude I would go grab the kick hammer and kick them from the lobby because I don't want people to get getting very mad and like being toxic to other kids cuz I want this game to be in peace so that way people could have fun playing so that's the end of what I was saying so thanks a lot for making the game I wish if this is what you wanted for me to tell you please I just really really really really wish I had moderator and I would be really really nice with it so whatever your name is I'm I really appreciate the game,⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️👑⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️ 🩷 🩷🩷 🩷🩷🩷🩷 🩷⬜️⬜️🩷 🩷🔳🔳🩷 🩷🩷🩷🩷 🩷🖤🖤🩷 🩷🖤🖤🩷 🩷🩷🩷🩷 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷 💚💚💚 💚💚💚 💚💚💚 💚💚💚 💚💚💚 💚💚💚 🩷🩷 🩷🩷 🩷 🩷,"I will not get people banned for any reason at all and i will be a helpful mod that will not tolerate toxicity in any way possible im very desperate My in game name is cozmovrr im a purple bear with demon horns Pot Favor, cozmo"
