For instance when I'm brushing teeth. The toothbrush bounces around. It's not seamless. This could be a problem on my end, but I haven't noticed it with other games. Hint: when cleaning the teeth. I simply pull them out and put them back in. Makes it easier for those hard to reach places","Life, it seems, will fade away Drifting further, every day Getting lost within myself Nothing matters, no one else I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free Things not what they used to be Missing one inside of me Deathly loss, this can't be real I cannot stand this hell I feel Emptiness is filling me To the point of agony Growing darkness, taking dawn I was me, but now he's gone No one but me Can save myself But it's too late Now I can't think Think why I should even try Yesterday seems as though It never existed Death greets me warm Now I will just say goodbye Bye-METALLICA","I was skeptical when I got this game but the fact that your working on big people is hilarious. I like games with repetition and this game has a lot of it, I could play for hours and not get bored. Great game guys.",10/10 You should definitely get it is extremely fun and you can just mess around and stuff or you can do what the client wants,It’s a really fun game but after a while you get the same thing over and over again. I feel like if there were more diverse things to do it would be more fun.
