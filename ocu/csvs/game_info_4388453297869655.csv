I got pretty addicted to it, and it took me a couple of months to complete all 12 levels and stages with 3 stars in each. Quest 2 helmet and controllers, limits the the handling of a bow in any game, but this one has an adjustment setting for that, makes it much better but not perfect. Would be nice with more levels and stages. I‚Äôm an archer IRL, and the arrows flight path is stunningly close to real life arrows flight path.","I looked up on YouTube the best archery games on Quest 2 and to be honest, I was a bit disappointed to run only into FPS games with a bow. And then, at the end of a top 5 list, Arrowhead!üôè It feels like playing archery on the old Nintendo Wii Sports, I love it! This is very much a chill, realistic game with great mechanics and physics. You'll get to blow off some steam and get a nice arm workout with no flashing light, loud bangs or other BS! It's basically Medieval Archer Simulator and it's done right! Much love to the devs, I'm only on Area 3 but I can see myself getting to 12 rather quickly. Please put out more content if you can, don't let the game die. Launch some DLCs if you need, I'll buy them. I wouldn't even mind modern compound bows. Or if you want to keep historical, add historical bows from different countries, different years, with little descriptions, different perks from other bows to make them unique, not just a different skin. Also, timed leaderboards, something to keep people coming back. Turn based multiplayer? Anyway, yep, love it, keep it up, I'll sure keep an eye out for updates! 10/10",Really enjoying this. Good mix of fun and fitness.,"I love archery and was looking for a descent game in vr and this is it.plays great,the controls work well and enough options to taylor it to your shooting style.the only gripes i have is it could be a little sharper looking,also turn based multiplayer would be Great. definitely recommend","This game doesn‚Äôt deserve to be in the app lab, it‚Äôs pretty awesome! The game is still developing, so I imagine that a lot of new features will be added in the future, can‚Äôt wait for it :) Just a suggestion for developers: I love the ‚Äúdetection loss‚Äù function, it helps a lot to adjust your arrow position if you want to remove the target circle for an advanced playing mode, but we need to adjust the position every time a level restart, and in the time challenges adjusting the arrow will use lot of the firsts seconds, it could be helpful to save the position settings so you don‚Äôt have to reset every time the arrow position when a level start. Thank you all for your amazing work and good job!"
