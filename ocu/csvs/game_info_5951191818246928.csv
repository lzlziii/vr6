Battle Bows,"Ready, Aim, POP! In a far-off land in a distant realm, Inflatium is the source of all life. Those born there are living, breathing balloons!

Now, their armies are pouring into your world, unleashing creatures whose evolution has taken a different, deadlier turn. Band together with other archers to defend your realmâ€™s Inflatium from terrifyingly zany living balloons!

Great bow mechanics makes it easy to jump into. It does get challenging but stays fun. A tutorial or practice area would be nice. One minor glitch was sometimes on the easy level, the arrow path didnâ€™t show up during gameplay. I had to exit to the menu and go back into the world and then it showed up. Not a biggie but just thought Iâ€™d point that out. Definitely a good time! Great job Devs!!",Devs if you are reading this I would like you guys to add more maps. At least two because this game needs more then one map to keep a lot of peoples attention and only having one map in this game and charging 20$ for it isnâ€™t that great. I think people like me would just appreciate having more things to do in this game. Other than that this game is satisfying and addictive. Not to mention how fun the multiplayer is. If you want a good tower defense game then donâ€™t mind hitting this game up. Itâ€™s a easy 9/10,"Personally, I love this game and it shows after being able to get 1st on both leaderboards but there is a few things to change, (which is to be expected because the game has only been out for a week.) 1. Some of the hit-boxes can feel really janky. An example is the double bomb guy and his bombs have really weird hit-boxes which is basically the fuse and no other part of the bomb. Also some of the bosses have weird hit-boxes like the purple and blue bosses. 2. There needs to be more clarification on the leaderboards. It needs to say if itâ€™s in the region or the world and a nice quality of life change would be showing what element the people on the leaderboards used in that run. 3. There are a few bugs in the game like when the Green guys spawn in sometimes they float and donâ€™t go to the ground and a few others that would be nice if squashed. Overall, this is a great game that is easy to play but very hard to master and every run feels different. The art styIe is unique and different to all other bow games on the market. I love this game and I just want to see it succeed, so I hope the devs keep updating the game and making fresh content. That is all, thank you for the amazing game! Edit: The hit-boxes have been fixed and other things have been improved. :)","Played for 30 minutes and I feel like I played everything there is to offer. There is only 1 map. There are 2 doors (so as long as you camp the doors, you are fine). There is no difference between co-op and solo other than the fact that you canâ€™t do anything about bad teammates not defending their side (so co-op is useless because of a bunch if kids). The leaderboard is pretty wonky because it encourages you to not play with people for accuracy and points. The bow is alright, but ALWAYS holding an arrow definitely needs to be fixed. There is no difference between the different elements (other than graphics). Overall, a bust of a release date and definitely do not recommend.","Played this with friends and solo, Fun game, would be good to have a crossbow option to saves the left arm ache from holding the bow ðŸ˜„ other then that a great app! I look forward to more maps and maybe a zombie wave in the future updates 5*****"
