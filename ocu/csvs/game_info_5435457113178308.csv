It's like you get a few random Mario 64 worlds to explore, though the levels are pre-made. Just randomly selected in a ""gauntlet"" of sorts. More levels would be amazing, but the current selection is diverse enough. My only gripe is sometimes the jump doesn't work, mainly when trying to jump from an edge that is rounded or dips. If you die, your gem progress is reset and the levels are changed, which can be frustrating if you die to a jump that didn't activate. But for what there is, it's definitely a steal for the price."
