Baseball Practice,"Automatic baseball pitching machine chucks a ball every 5 seconds or so. Try and knock it out of the park. Play in 12 minute sessions. Enough time for a good workout. Receive stats such as number of home runs, longest hit, average flight distance, etc. Try to make the monthly leader board. Try to make the Wall of Champions. Try to be a Legend !!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Simulation, Sports",English,1.0,"Gurglurator Entertainment, Inc.","Gurglurator Entertainment, Inc.",http://www.gurglurator.com/,"Aug 27, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3530121767088767/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3530121767088767&r=1, https://gurglurator.com/privacyPolicy.asp",234.6 MB,Very cool game if you like hitting home runs ! My only complaint is the leader board !!!!!! Got quite a few high scores that never showed up on the leader board !!!!!! Very upsetting !!!!!!,"The game is really good but I wish that they can make stands with fans in the stadium so it isn’t just boring, I also think it would be better if they made the homerun distance realistic because nobody can hit a ball 2200 feet",Would get 5 stars but ive hit 65 home runs twice and had a streak of 17 Homer's and a average flight distance of over 1200 multiple times but doesnt show up on the board,Wish you could play other positions,It’s really bad game and I do not enjoy it. It is very boring. I wish you could play other positions. ￼
