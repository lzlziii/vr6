You get stuck in certain places. Just exit the game and start back over. And you'll be able to get back-and-forth in certain areas. Sometimes, it doesn't pick you up in the room, so you have to consistently keep waving your hands. Touch the dryer. The picture is pretty much everything in the room. Sometimes, you have to come out and restart. Do your wheel fall through the floor or sometimes . The game needs more work but if you are a doctor who's fan like I am just restart the game and your stuff will reappear if it disappears, and you'll be put back in the area you're supposed to be in. Right now, i've been chased by the angels And they keep popping up out of nowhere so I have to quit. I'll get back on later","Highly underrated game. Bit on the short side, but if you're a fan of the series or have even the slightest interest in stepping into the 13th doctor's Tardis don't skip this one! Definitely worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot): b i t , l y / d r w h o q u e s t","I bought this game because I loved the doctor who show, but moving is super slow in-game and I can't leave the laundromat without falling out of the map.Please help or I want a refund.","I recently got the game but there's one problem that I've been having which is whenever I'm in the managers office I can't move anything but the picture of the old man that had the pass code ""14"" on the back of it. I'm pretty sure that there's nothing wrong with my controllers since I don't have that same problem with any other game EXCEPT this one.. I restarted the game various of times, closed the app and opened it, restarted my oculus, replaced my batteries, and it's the same problem. Please fix this problem and I'd really appreciate it, thank you.","I have had so much fun with this game and trying to find the collectibles. While some of the puzzles were a bit challenging, I never had a dull moment. I can see myself replaying this again and again. And remember, DON'T BLINK. DON'T EVEN BLINK. BLINK AND YOU'RE DEAD."
