I use there other modes occasionally. The developers have done a great job with this app. It has simple choices to make. That matters to me.",UPDATE: the developers were in contact with me right away and fixed the problem. Excellent customer service…..Paid the money to unlock the full app and still only have access to the free version. Horrible! Can’t figure out how to contact them either.,I use float mainly at the end of my day just to relax and get ready to sleep! I’m loving the music! It’s always different and always perfect! I love seeing the creatures and find myself enjoying following where they are going! I’d love to see them interact with each other if that was possible? I am a classic overthinker and Float is really helping me let go of my day and stress and just chill! I am very grateful and thankful!,"There are two modes Relax and Energize presently. Relax is ok, but something like Energize is rare in vr world. I love the speed and wish I could adjust to go faster. I get it, I know a lot of folks get motion sickness in VR, not me, I love the speed. FLOAT is best so far offering a decent VR relaxing speed through space experiece. This mode is amazing. If an additional star warp-type, star-field type effect can be added with stars and planets streaming by with deep twists and turns, that would be great. Watch the classic movie Contact with Jodie Foster to get an idea. Nice work.",I just started with the float app and it is so calming and peaceful helped me unwind after a few stressful days also it gave me a pick-me-up when I was feeling blaa. Wonderful app I can not say enough about it.
