My daughter is obsessed with petting all of the animals and throwing the ball over the walls. Definitely worth a download to wander around and explore. The capture-the-eagles game was a great addition.,I <3 the zoo and this game gave me a lovely day at the zoo experience. The animals looked surprisingly real and lots o animals to see. Def recommend this for anyone wanting to play a zoo game or rest at the zoo,High quality animals for a Quest environment in my opinion and the kind of game you could let a new Vr player wonder around in,"I used to be a broken man, my wife had left me, my children were gone, and i was on the brink of ending it all. Then, a man on reddit approached me and gave me a key to ZOSU Zoo, i learned later that this was Mr. ZOSU Himself, maybe even the Holy Spirit. I played for hours on end, even got into the ZOSU Zoo speedrunning community, and i currently hold the record for Eagle%. It is a overall life changing experience and i feel like world peace would be attained if we gave everyone an oculus quest 2 and a key to ZOSU Zoo.",Found out about this game from a dev post on the Oculus Quest 2 subreddit. Animals are changing and the Eagles are near to catch. I enjoyed going underwater and playing with the fish and then sprinting away to catch another eagle. I highly recommend this for young kids who are interested in animals.
