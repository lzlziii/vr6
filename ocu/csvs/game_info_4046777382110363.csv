The single player mode is great with quite a few maps to play. The Tetris elements are really good and scratch that Tetris itch quite well. PvP is super fun as well, it gets really intense. Highly recommend.","This is a fun little game with a lot of potential. It still needs a bit of polish, but i was happy to buy this game and support the developer as this brought back a lot of nostalgia for me.

Hope for multiplayer one day!,This game has a lot of potential if the little bugs are works out here and there.,I didn't know about Rampart until I found Ramcastle. I'm a little addicted now :P
