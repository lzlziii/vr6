Personally, I prefer playing solo, or Co-Op with a friend, not big on PVP these days and yet, Zero Caliber excels in all those areas in large part thanks to the amount of interactivity you have with the world around you, climbing ladders, ducking behind cover, and controlling levers/devices that progress the plot. A nice little addition to this game in my opinion is the firing range which is located on your left when you start the game. The range has both stationary targets that flip up upon being hit and a fully usable range that allows you to set target distances and see in real time where your bullets are landing. Another big bonus of the range is the fact that you are able to spawn any weapon in the game, along with any attachments you want, and test that assembly before taking it out into the field, just a great place to practice your reloading and improve your accuracy. As of my writing this, the Modding section has been added and so far I love it, the attention to single player experiences is a major reason I prefer Zero Caliber to other similar shooters, CS players will especially enjoy this. With the possible addition of a Zombie game mode in the works, ZC keeps me steeped in anticipation, and I have yet to be unimpressed by anything put forth, just keeps getting better! Thank you to the Dev team, this is a very solid win, and sets an example to other VR developers, of what needs to be emulated to give life to the world they’re building. Sorry for the long winded review, just such a good game, and you will definitely get your moneys worth!","First, let me say that I do not normally play shooter games. However, my friends have this game, and they love it, and I want to play with them, so I got it. It took me about 4 hours of play before I figured out all the controls and all the weapons, and then my friends and other players helped me customize my loadouts and gave me game play tips. Really great community! I especially enjoy PvP play. When you can just say to everyone, ""Truce, we just want to meet you."" Lol! Maybe this is supposed to be a simulation of real life. But I would really appreciate it if an update could include the ability to reload just by pointing the gun down and then back up. I'm having a blast, though!","This game is amazing and its getting even better now with mod support i really recommend getting this game if you like good shooters. The servers are always full and it has a fun campaign to do alone or with a friend Search Multiver.Bio.Link so you can get 25 off of this game and many more, Hit “Helpful” if this made your purchase even more worth it.","I got this game because I played it on another headset and loved it. So I naturally wanted to get this game for my quest 2. The guns feel great besides 2 things. 1) sensitive 2 handed controls with primary weapons 2) most guns can be AK reloaded, don’t get me wrong it’s fun to reload AKs, but when I pick up an M4 or G36 I don’t expect to reload those platforms. The best things offered from this game are the advanced movement, missions that make me feel like I’m in a mission impossible movie, the mod support, the overall feel of the personal options and preferences and lastly the secrets laid around the maps. This game was my first vr shooter and it has a staple in my heart just for that. Xreal, if you see this, please, keep up the good work",I've been wanting a good single player 1st person shooter and this is exactly what I wanted to in 1. Was nervous not go I after hearing all the negative reviews of the graphics but that update in my opinion makes it look wonderful I guess I never get the try it before the update so I can't really compare it but I am so happy
