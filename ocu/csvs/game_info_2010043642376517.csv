Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,"In Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player is trapped in a virtual room with a ticking time bomb they must defuse. The other players are the “Experts” who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb by deciphering the information found in the Bomb Defusal Manual. But there’s a catch: the Experts can’t see the bomb, so everyone will need to talk it out –fast! Features: • Challenging puzzles – Test the limits of your communication skills… and friendships? • A different bomb every time – Procedurally generated puzzles keep the action fresh. • Local multiplayer party game – A great way to experience VR with all of your friends! • Only one copy of the game needed – If you can talk to the bomb Defuser, you can be their Expert. Try using your favorite voice chat service to play remotely. • Requires 2 or more players – Bomb defusing is a team endeavor. Going solo is not an option!

We played it with 5 people and it was the most fun thing since months. The levels/bombs have different difficulties and are challenging all the same. You can play it with only two players or up to as many as you like. I don’t regret buying it and recommend it to anyone. Please leave a 👍🏻 if this review was helpful. Thanks and enjoy!","Use the link below to get money off this game. Just remove the words ""REMOVE"" and put it all together https://www.REMOVE oculus.REMOVE com/appreREMOVE ferrals/ChaddJ/20100436REMOVE 42376517/?utm_source=2 This game is pretty fun with at least one other person. You can have more people playing which makes it more fun if they're all involved trying to defuse the bomb. There is a downloadable pdf document that you use with this game. One person wears the VR and sees a bomb in front of them. The others with the PDF have the instructions for diffusing the bomb. You work together by the person in VR describing the bomb while the others ask questions and tell them how to diffuse it. There are many different bomb scenarios and it gets harder and harder as you go. It can be confusing at first for new people to play so I would start on the easiest bomb so they can all see what it's like and get a feel for how it works then it makes more sense why you're yelling random instructions to someone. I enjoy games where others without a VR can enjoy it as well and participate. This is a great party game to keep multiple people involved. It's worth the price!","Awesome game to play with friends. I usually play it with my wife and it’s great fun. It demands a few bombs to explain/understand how to solve the problems, but when you get it, it’s super fun to try to desactivate the bomb before it explodes. Every bomb is different, and you will not find 2 equals, and this gives you the opportunity to never get bored.",This is a genuinely great game and I love the intensity and tension with friends or family . And all for a great price.
