I have a few suggestions for you to add in (sorry if it‚Äôs too much to ask but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get there because you‚Äôve worked so hard to make this game as perfect as possible) I would love to see on the hostage rescue missions instead of as few people guarding around the hostage, there should be a guard holding the hostage pointing a gun at them. I think you should also add voice commands into the game so you can just be like GET DOWN ON THE GROUND AND OUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK! üòÇ another suggestion for you is to try and add kicking the doors Down into the game as well- it would ad so much more realism to the game. Thanks and keep up the hard work üëç",The game is very good and I like it a lot. But it will get old pretty fast. And I would recommend you have some friends get the game with you. So you don‚Äôt bored as quickly. And so you don‚Äôt have to deal with annoying little kids. And remember that it‚Äôs not finished yet so if you experience any problems. You most likely will need to restart the game and get back in. But otherwise it is a very good game and I would recommend it.,"Pros: 1. The gun play is top notch 2. Running/walking speed is solid 3. The AI isn‚Äôt bad 4. Room randomizer is absolutely amazing 5. You can set your height 6. Customize your vest (however it is a little janky) 7. Voice chat is functional (it‚Äôs not the best) 8. Playing with friends and even solo is a blast 9. Sound design is extremely immersive 10. Decent variety of weapon customization Cons 1. No tutorial (took me a couple of weeks to figure out all the mechanics the game has to offer (scroll to end for my specialized tutorial of all the mechanics)) 2. Ladders are a nightmare 3. No fall damage 4. Minor bugs and inconveniences every now and then 5. Lacks maps 6. No gunner/m249 (immediate five stars and kiss on the cheek if implemented) 7. No jump 8. Knife is extremely inconsistent My extra special spicy tutorial on mechanics: Night vision: hold the right grab and trigger buttons and A at the same time over the top of your helmet Slow/silent walk: hold down the right stick while walking Crouch: crouch irl Prone: prone irl Flashlight: left trigger Laser: B or X (I forgot which one exactly) Bolt release: slam hand where the bolt release is or if you don‚Äôt know guns, above where the mag goes into (however this only works 50% of the time) Mag release: A Radio: left grab button on top left slide of your vest Everything else should be self explanatory, load mag, rack the slide, pew pew pew, reload, rack slide/slide release, more pew pew pew."
