Eye of the Temple,"Embark on an adventure to explore a vast and treacherous temple and uncover the ancient legend of the Eye. Keep your balance as you step between moving blocks, dodging hazardous traps and solving environmental puzzles with just your torch and whip in hand. This game requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m. TRAVERSE A VAST ENVIRONMENT: Eye of the Temple makes unique use of room-scale VR to deliver an experience of navigating an expansive space. Lose yourself in the depths of the temple without teleportation, artificial locomotion, or other distractions. USE A FULLY PHYSICALLY SIMULATED WHIP: Wield your whip to grab levers and defend yourself from threats. Before long, you’ll have mastered it as a reliable tool and effective weapon. AN EXPERIENCE PLAYED WITH YOUR OWN BODY: Step onto blocks, flick levers, and dodge obstacles. You’ll play this physical game not with controller buttons, but your body, and it’s designed to be easily approachable regardless of whether you normally play video games. UNLOCKABLE SPEEDRUN CHALLENGES: If you’re an extra daring adventurer, you can unlock speedrun challenges where you can build up incredible speed for a true test of your temple-running prowess. Please note! You may get a sensation of almost losing your balance when blocks you stand on start or stop moving, and there is a small risk of falling over. This will usually quickly decrease over time. The game also has various VR comfort options.",7+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), Danish, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish (Spain)","1.421

Eye of the Temple truly tricked my brain into full immersion. No thumb stick movement here! You must physically walk, duck, crawl, and balance in your play space - but the game brilliantly keeps bringing you back to the center of your space using these same movement mechanics. The puzzles are not too difficult, but just hard enough to make you think, and they felt rewarding when I solved them. You won’t regret picking up this game!! Thank you, Rune Skovbo Johansen, for making this masterpiece. **Note about space - You will definitely need all of the 2m x 2m play space (approx 6.5ft by 6.5ft) to safely play this game. Your sense of balance will be tested, and at times you have to move fast. Even with these restrictions, and needing to move my furniture around to play this game, it was worth EVERY BIT of the effort.","➡️ quest25.bio.link Get % Off for Quest Games ---- ➡️ My new Projekt: Deals24.net ⬅️ ---- PLZ Like this Review for the other Players ---- Title: A Captivating Journey Through Time - Eye of the Temple is an Impressive VR Game! Review: Eye of the Temple is an outstanding VR game that captivated me from the very beginning. As an avid VR player, I have experienced many adventures, but Eye of the Temple stands out with its unique gameplay and innovative controls. The gameplay of Eye of the Temple is simply breathtaking. You assume the role of a brave explorer and embark on a captivating journey through time. The movements are controlled in a unique way, where you physically move in the room and explore the environment by gazing at the horizon. This innovative technique provides an incredibly immersive gaming experience rarely found in other VR games. The levels in Eye of the Temple are meticulously designed and offer a variety of challenges. You must skillfully dodge obstacles, overcome traps, and solve puzzles as you navigate through the ancient temple world. Each step feels realistic, as if you were truly on-site, and the breathtaking environments amplify this feeling even more. Another remarkable feature of Eye of the Temple is the atmosphere it creates. The mystical ambiance and well-placed sound effects provide an exciting and sometimes eerie experience. You truly feel like an explorer uncovering secrets in a bygone era. The VR controls are precise and intuitive. Movements are seamlessly captured, and the ability to move in the room without relying on virtual joysticks makes the gameplay incredibly enjoyable and realistic. Eye of the Temple is a VR game that fully harnesses the potential of virtual reality, offering a unique gaming experience. It masterfully combines exploration, puzzles, action, and atmosphere, immersing the player in a fascinating past. If you're looking for an unforgettable VR adventure, you must absolutely try Eye of the Temple. It's a masterpiece that will captivate you!","As someone who didn't really expect much from looks alone but instead went off the near perfect store rating, I held my breath as I booted it up for the first time. Fortunately, i was to find it is top rated for a reason. What at first seems like an almost childish room scale puzzler, due to the relative simplicity of the first section and the pretty but slightly cartoonish graphics, quickly reveals itself to be quite a deep and progressively challenging experience as you descend through the many varied chambers of the temple. And to each there are unique puzzle sections that you have to ponder and plan ahead to get through and to the next. I'm about a few hours in and I think I'm still a ways from beating the game, and the more playtime I get the more apparent how much value for money I'm accruing. The thought that must have gone into designing this game, given the minimum 2m x 2m play space, has become an prominent thought as I turn a corner and the temple and it's innumerable navigable platforms continue to work in harmony with the confines of the playspace. On this point, the game does an excellent job of both keeping you safe within the guardian and immersing you enough that you forget you have a set playspace at all. I could drone on but it'll only muddy the points I've already made. If you like the genres this game covers, predominantly platformers and puzzlers, and you're physically able to play this game I cannot recommend it enough. I've started to refund games here and there that I feel are either overpriced and/or under delivering and this is not only well worth the money it's also well worth it's standing in the esteem of its players. To the devs, hats off to you. Creating this game must have been so much more of a brain trainer than playing it. Very impressive","I love how this game thinks out of the box, it is such a good time to play. My kids love it. The way you can walk around or in your play area but in the game you’re actually walking around this world is so amazing. If you like good puzzle game and adventure, with a cool twist on locomotion in vr this is a good game for you and it’s a great game for the family.",This game i could play for days it’s so fun if you are a Indiana Jones fan or just looking for a really fun game this is the one all the puzzles and how you actually have to move around it is sooooo good being honest this game I played for hours and hours so if you are looking for a puzzle game or adventure game this is the best option .
