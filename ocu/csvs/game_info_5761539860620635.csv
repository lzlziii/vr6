But it is the game play,so addictive..stupid game I keep saying but oh so Addictive..your be saying over and over again. Just one more try. Cast it to your tv or iPad and let your family watch and take it in turns. Great fun,at silly price!!!!","The Handless Show is an amazing VR game show experience. It brings me back to watching game shows as a child, and playing the stressful board game Operation. Your skills and reflexes will be put to the test in this game show. With 20 fun mini games to step on up to and play. People are not here to see you win a new car, or a stack of money. No they are here to watch your hands get cut off. That's right, in this game show, we play in hopes of keeping our hands. The game is very easy to learn, nerve wrecking to master. The mini games are each unique and fun to play, and will bring a smile to your face and tense you up at the same time. One wrong move and CHOP, your hands come off. The graphics and sounds are great, making you feel like you are a contestant on a game show. The crowd cheering you on as you rise onto the show just feels amazing. The controls are very easy to use and figure out. The game had a few glitches where my hands got stuck in the game, but it did not happen often. Fun factory this game has. I love playing this game over and over. Losing is actually fun in this game. If you love game shows, and want to feel the call to come on down and be the next contestant, the Handless Show is a VR experience for you.",Gameplay: https://youtu.be/3BTdX5RgUw4 This is fun for a short ammount of time with only so many mini games that do get repetitive over time. The price as Â£10.99 is way over what I would expect for a game like this. With no options to change any settings and o ly one area I would expect more. Huge opportunity gone to use hand tracking in a game like this also. For what it is can be fun to just show someone but with a high price and not much content changes would need to be made before I change my review.
