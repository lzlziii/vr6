I played for like 15 min and then stopped. It said ""trial expired"". This was strange because the game is a DEMO so that's mean is free without some stuff from the paid version.","Amazing game, really fun and satisfying to play. But can someone please tell me what the eggs do(the ones that spawn on the right on top of the items draw) Edit:I think the devs updated the game because now it says I need to pay to play the game","If you want to know this game Is really good, your probably wondering why I did a 4 stars even though at the start I said itâ€™s really good but when you pluck out their teeth especially of the Naruto one because heâ€™s the child version of himself itâ€™s kinda uncomfortable taking out a childâ€™s teeth..",The game said it was free and so did the tiktok video but it told me my free trial just endedðŸ˜¡ It is a fun game tho.I enjoy it,"Awesome experience, tons of fun and laughter, great for teaching young children the importance of oral cleanliness, had a lot of laughs with the fly explosion, Truly an amazing experience to play for a while (in my case 30 minutes in a row)"
