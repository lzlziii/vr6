Moon Slime: Space Sport,"Play as two astronauts on the moon, slapping slime balls in a crazy sport where anything goes! The enemy gets smarter, so how high can your score get? Pick up powerups that transform alien slimes into lightning, ice, bombs and even poop! Protect your flags and just keep smashing those silly slimes.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,Sports,English,1.0.6,Studio Tonkin,Studio Tonkin,https://www.studiotonkin.com/,"May 16, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5132017190239527/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5132017190239527&r=1, https://studiotonkin.com/privacy-policies/",135.3 MB,"I enjoyed this game a lot and it entertained me very well. It was a nice break from most vr games that try to do things that the quest 2 isn’t ready for and over complicate the game. This is a great, fun, simple game to just relax and play. I hope in the future more content will be added, like possibly difficulties and levels.","[Product received for free] Fun and challenging arcade experience. It reminds me of Air Hockey, but on the moon. The craterous terrain gives the ball all sorts of action that's difficult to master. Don't expect more than you see in the trailer, but if you're looking for a satisfying game to spend time mastering, Moon Slime might be it.","Got a free key to test. For the price I believe it to be a pretty cute and fun arcade game to have fun with, it can get pretty hectic and you get to spread your arms a lot and really use up your space which brings the importance of being very aware of your surroundings as I personally bonked the wall at least once of twice! That being said it's very fun to feel so free to use your space in the game, grabbing powerups and doing my best to overwhelm the adversary.","[Recived this product for free] Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play something sorta like Tennis while at the same time beating the ever-living crap outta some slimes? This is that game. A high score challenge that's all about smashing jelly-like Bois into flag poles, but if the install size doesn't give it away, this game is mostly skin and bones, there's not that much here. Sure the power-ups are fun, and the gameplay is pretty novel, but the novelty wears off with time. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this game, it's just that a single-player-only game that repeats itself over and over again can get pretty boring. Still, nice game, very cool.",Got a free key to test. Feels kind of like nock meets air hockey in that you’re frantically chasing bouncing balls in an arena often behind you or out of sight. Is pretty simple from what I see and is priced appropriately.
