It's so nice to be able to pilot a shuttle the way it was meant to be piloted! The hand tracking is amazing and I look forward to seeing where you take this project in the future! LLAP!,"OK, being able to get into a shuttle and actually get it to move is kinda epic. What it lacks is playability. Severe limitations on what you can do, and more controls that you can't touch and ha e no affect then you know what to do with. If you set course and speed and move around the ship, the other displays simply do not do anything. Another severe loss is no warp capabilities. I hope this is getting ported into an actual game, but there is a lot that could be added to make it seem a little more true. Like a replicator... Lol Nice but semi blurry visuals. As a long time star trek fan I did nerd out, it just went by kinda quick.",Thank you for making this! I have WAYS DREAMED of being inside of a starship or even this shuttle is really awesome! You did a great work i would pay money for a Starship like Voyager or Discovery or Enterprise I know thats asking alot but you have GOLD here! I LOVE THIS DEMO!! THANK YOU AGAIN THIS!!!,What a great little experience Found myself just relaxing watching the cosmos go by Genuine feeling of movement with some excellent reflections & interactions I can't wait to see were this ends up Would tweak the movement & the displays higher res..less pixelated at least Other than that really felt I was out of my crappy life for a while ..& maaaaaan those reflections ..who said that couldn't be done without being tethered to a high end PC Bravo Devs Cheers üòÅ,"I was blown away by this shuttle, I'm a voyager fan and this really does feel like a authentic shuttle, with interaction too ! would be amazing if you could do the uss voyager ship to explore or even the delta flyer. or perhaps make it so the transporter could transport you to a planet or something. love the captain's log and the ability to drive the shuttle, would be good to have a warp option too, would be willing to pay for updates etc."
