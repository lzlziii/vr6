Cook-Out,"“This is the kind of social videogame Oculus Quest was made for.” - VRFocus “...offers up everything that I could ask for in an immersive VR experience."" - TheGamer Get Your Aprons Ready… Things Are About To Get Messy! Set within the cook’s cabin of a fairytale forest, Cook-Out: A Sandwich Tale is a wacky and whimsical adventure that challenges up to four players to work together to keep the orders coming for a hungry cast of enchanted creatures in this multiplayer VR title from Resolution Games. As players progress through increasingly hectic levels, they’ll not only prepare meals but will also need to fight off a number of nasty customers who seem absolutely set on making trouble. With some of the game’s most recent updates, players can add to the fun by upgrading their chef’s look with the “Make it Your Way feature” and join the “House Party” update for new skins, customizations and more! While the game is focused on cooperative play, solo players can also enjoy the experience.",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Casual, Social","English, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Venezuela)",1.14.220773,Resolution Games,Resolution Games,https://www.resolutiongames.com/cookout,"Sep 3, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2004774962957063/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=2004774962957063&r=1, https://www.resolutiongames.com/privacy",Terms of Service,1.65 GB,"It’s a fun game! Although, after using it about 5 times my cooking area has lowered and I cannot get it back to waist level. I have to be on my knees to use the cooking area. I’ve uninstalled and reinstalled the game in hopes that it would reset it. I’m not sure if I changed something in the settings, but all the other games have been fine. Any ideas on how to fix this?",I gave it a five star because when you played by yourself is the greatest thing on earth. The only thing that I do not like is when the little kids get on and they go and jump into your page and start destroying your game that you work so hard for so sometimes this is why I wait at midnight so the kids I think will be sleeping. But like I said this game is the greatest game there is they need to make more updates and more challenging. Love this game.,"Update July 2023: game still full of errors, friends joining via room code in public lobbies get auto kicked for no reason, and this game has deleted ALL DATA TWICE! I had to start completely over on levels, endless mode high score and recipes. After the third restart I gave up on the recipes, and all the avatar upgrades I “bought” with my coins. I love the game, wish it functioned better, and games could be experience based matching love this game, it can be very fun, unfortunately I seem to always have connection issues, lobbies that glitch out with “customers” still locked on the screen after a level has ended, it’s hard to find competent players to play with. I would like to be able to see what the achievements are, like on xbox, and even if it’s a secret one, still have the chance to work towards achievements. Some of us want to finish the whole game. Would like more updates, either map expansion or additional challenge modes.","Awesome game, but i ran into a problem. Im not sure if its a bug or an error. All my progress was deleted and went back to level 1. Although my achievements are still there, everything went back to the beginning. Please help.!",I really enjoy this game and think it’s a lot fun but once I got to higher levels it was near impossible and then impossible to beat. I do wish there was different difficulty levels because I do really enjoy it
