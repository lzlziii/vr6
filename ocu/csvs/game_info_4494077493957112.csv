It is smooth fun and actually teaches you the game and I’m sure as more updates come out the better it’s gonna get I just hope your guys keep putting new courses and new discs on here,"All in all it’s a great game and I love the idea of it and work out in. That being said discs do not throw or perform accurately half of the time. Power is way off and inconsistent. Putting I can throw the same disc, same way and it might go 10 ft or 90 ft. Some of the out of bounds could be adjusted to be less harsh and narrow(some holes have the out of bounds going through the tee box) Realistic power is way too strong, power scale needs adjusted. Discs should curve throwing hyzer or anhyzer and they either don’t or don’t accurately. Tomahawk throw doesn’t work at all even though it says tomahawk. Rollers barely move. Love disc golf and play 1-2 times a week, with this game I get to play more. So would love to see the physics fixed. Would love to see a “mulligan” option so when the game doesn’t hoses you on a throw you can erase that throw. Would like to change putting options (turbo putt option would be nice).","This game is really well made, the physics and disc control feel really real and so fun. I would love it if they added a little fantasy, something akin to walkabout mini golf would add layers to the game that make me feel like it's an experience I can't go to my local disc golf course to have. That said it's also awesome!",Well done developers you ve nailed the feel of disc golf beautifully. Keep up the great work.,Love this game every time I play it I get better at it. Recommend for any disc golf gamer
