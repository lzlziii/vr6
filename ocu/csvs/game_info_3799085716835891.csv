Beat Blaster DEMO,"Beat Blaster is a VR game of shooting, running, and dodging where everything happens to the music rhythm. An original mix of styles where each game will offer you a new challenge. 30 SONGS & AMBISONIC AUDIO Each level introduces a novelty, and all the games are different thanks to the intelligent generation of levels. Ambisonic sound lets you experience the music in an entirely new way. 3 WAYS OF MOVEMENT You can choose between the classic VR controller, tilting the head, or the intuitive and original control based on the head's movement. NO MOTION SICKNESS Beat Blaster is a VR game with a high-speed component. But all the game moves are designed without rotating the player, thus minimizing the probability of motion sickness. EASY RULES To clear a level, you must reach the end of the song without dying. You have a Blaster with infinite ammunition and single life to dodge or kill all the enemies that will appear to the music's rhythm.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Music, Shooter","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain)",1.91,Ivanovich Games,Ivanovich Games,https://www.ivanovichgames.com/,"May 3, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3799085716835891/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3799085716835891&r=1, https://www.ivanovichgames.com/privacy.html",Terms of Service,214.6 MB,For how fast the game goes I'm surprised I didn't get much motion sickness at all. At first it seemed really hard for me but I did manage to finish the demo. Graphics are good and it's surprisingly addictive.,"Can't get the bad reviews, this game is a 5/5! The movement based in heads motion is absolutely sick!! Easy to grasp, i got it almost immediately and it's very very unique!! No other game has made me feel this way, it almost feels like you control your movement with your brain! Music is awesome but graphics could get a small upgrade.. Overall a fantastic title that I'm certainty going to buy!",Gave me motion sickness. Controls are way too sensitive.,"Unlike pistol whip, this game requires to move by tilting your head. Even with basic graphics, i feel nausea",This is the first game with locomotion that doesn't make me feel sick. Leaning into the direction you want to go is amazing. It's like riding a hoverboard. I wish more games did this. Very impressive.
