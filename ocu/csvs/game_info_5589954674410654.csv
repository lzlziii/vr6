If there was some more variety to the relax zone, maybe having alternate spaces would bring more depth to the game. Have a couple more minigames is a must, the more variety the longer users will play the game. Great vr games, although most are short, have much variety. Just some thoughts I thought I should share, good luck in development.","Some kinda mini social games hub, and seems quite posh. I forgot what game I played but it was all very colorful and nice.","At the moment, there is only one minigame that you can play. It’s a fun game but it does get repetitive after a while. I like dual wielding to shoot the pink balls. It’s not exactly challenging, though. I’m honestly not sure if there is a way to “lose”, the game seems to go on forever with virtually no way to fail."
