I was blown away by the level of quality and attention to detail in the game. The environments are absolutely beautiful and the high refresh rate and clear image make for an great immersive experience. This is a great gateway for those new to VR. It is easy to pick up and won't make you dizzy. The gameplay itself is a lot of fun, but don't be fooled - it gets challenging quickly. The level editor is a great addition and allows for endless possibilities of play. The cute character and lovely costumes are just the cherry on top. Overall, I highly recommend it to any VR enthusiast and newcomer.","Ok so don‚Äôt think this game is just for children. Graphics are really good and very vibrant. The theme here is of the child‚Äôs imagination, where by everything is made from cardboard, come on we all loved big card board boxes as kids üòÅ Put that all a side this game is very challenging, yes it starts of easy to ease you in but as you progress the challenge gets real. You have these 3D puzzles that you have to navigate the child through to the lanterns. There is also an editor mode, this lets you create your own levels and share them with the PathCraft community for endless fun. I don‚Äôt think anyone would have any issues with motion sickness either playing this. I do have a video up on my YouTube channel called fun with the clicks if you were interested in some gameplay.","It‚Äôs harder than I thought, like others said ‚Äúvery challenging‚Äù. The interaction is very straightforward, and you can understand the game logic immediately in first few levels. The visual is very nice and comfortable, with nice background music. I haven‚Äôt completed all levels yet, but I will keep trying in coming days, Wish me luck! And 100% recommend this puzzle game to others!","**Will update the review once I'm deeper in the game** The game is very pretty, smooth and the music is charming. Everything fits together very well, like a puzzle! Talking about puzzles, the game itself present puzzle with increasing difficulty. The complexity of the puzzles varies from a very simple straight puzzle, to multiple turns and even horizontal levels. The mechanics are super simple making it a perfect game for the family or to play sitting on a week night where you just want to free your mind and have some pure fun. Grab the game, it's a great fun!",Fun and cute game that reminds me a little bit of Lemmings. The puzzles are fun and challenging but never overwhelming (though I haven't finished all puzzles yet). I love the hand-painted style and the level of details in the environments- You don't want to leave the game once you're in it.
