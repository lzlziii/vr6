I remember getting the app for the first time on the wii u. I remember loving it, because it was like a better version on minecraft. Sure, it doesn't have as many animals as minecraft, but it makes up for it with the materials it gives you, including the ability to do custom lighting and the ability to change colors of diffrent block. I didn't think they could make it better, but they somehow did. They made it possible to play in vr and gave some extra blocks to go with it. Keep making the game as good as it is now.","I was hesitant to pay $10 for the full version of this instead of getting the free lite version through side quest. I’m glad I paid to get the full version. It has more to work with like letters, lights, and even paint! Graphics are a bit more realistic too. I do wish it had more to work with for what I’m wanting to build like train tracks, maybe beds if I want to build a hotel or a house, ladders, and a mine cart to put on a train track if I want to build a roller coaster. I’m sure we’ll see that in one of the next updates though 🤞🏻. I can make do with what I got so far. Other than that… I really enjoy this and spent hours on it building something big. I’m excited to see how my builds in this thing turn out. I’m also excited for improvements they decide to make in the future for this game too like mentioned earlier, more objects to work with. That said… don’t hesitate to buy this awesome VR world building game.","𝕋𝕙𝕖 𝕘𝕣𝕒𝕡𝕙𝕚𝕔𝕤 𝕒𝕣𝕖 𝕔𝕣𝕒𝕡𝕡𝕪, 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕒𝕣𝕖 𝕤𝕥𝕦𝕔𝕜 𝕚𝕟 𝕔𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕥𝕚𝕧𝕖, 𝕒𝕟𝕕 𝕪𝕠𝕦 𝕔𝕒𝕟'𝕥 𝕖𝕧𝕖𝕟 𝕞𝕠𝕧𝕖 𝕪𝕠𝕦𝕣 𝕒𝕣𝕞𝕤 𝕠𝕗 𝕪𝕠𝕦𝕣 𝕔𝕙𝕒𝕣𝕒𝕔𝕥𝕖𝕣",Please add a survival mode creator and also can we have hands
