Good graphic (especially on the fighters details) and arcade gameplay makes this game a must if you want to have fun time doing hadoken (Powerballs) and many other special moves!!! In my opinion developers could make the special moves more accurate/easy to do with the next update (sometime the game could become frustrating...). Overall is a good game considering is also cheap!,"This is the next step of fighting games. It is like Street fighter or Tekken in VR. First person fighting with specials, kicks and punches and freedom of movement roomscale and with joystick. Much more complete than current boxing games in quest. Totally recomended game!","Game still feels like it's in early development but it has so much potential. I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time so splashed out to support the development. I will add to my review as the game improves. Some feed back for the developers: Everything feels great except the kicking system, it's off putting having to put your hand in a certain position to get a certain kick. I think just have left high kick, left low kick, left middle kick by pressing in the joy stick and then the same the other side. Without the stamina cancel for the kicks."
