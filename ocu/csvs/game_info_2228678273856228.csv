Espire 1: VR Operative,"**Now including our free 1.9 Invictus update with enhancements for Quest 1 & 2 users.** With Espire 1, we're delivering VR's definitive Stealth Experience. Gone are the days of watching a super-spy hero on-screen: by leveraging the head and hand-tracked capabilities of current VR technology, players can physically live out their 007 fantasies as the Espire Model 1 Operative. These stealth mechanics cannot be replicated on another medium. Players assume the role of an Espire Agent - a drone operator of the future. From the safety of their ""Espire Control Theatre"" (sized to their Oculus Guardian Boundaries) they deploy the Espire Model 1 operative on assignments around the globe. The player then remote-operates Espire 1 from thousands of Kilometres away - the player's movement is translated 1:1 into that of Espire.. The ""Control Theatre"" mechanic is not only a story component; it is used to minimize VR sickness whenever the player performs artificial movement.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Shooting","English, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Spain)",1.9.166,Digital Lode Immersive Media,Tripwire Interactive,https://espire1.com/,"Nov 22, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2228678273856228/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2228678273856228&r=1, http://thelode.com.au/privacy-policy/",4.25 GB,"Yes, youâ€™ll find weird things here and there, such as: the AI can still report you while youâ€™re punching it rapidly to knock it out, you could have added a cooldown to that, but since Espire 2 is out, I guess nobody is going to take care of this too muchâ€¦ and thatâ€™s okay! ^^ I should also probably note that I am not the type of person to buy this game, play this game, or even like it, yet I still enjoyed it! I was sort of pressured into buying this (I will have my revenge on you >-> ) After you finish the main missions (Yup, itâ€™ll take a while ^^â€™ ), you still have a lot left to do, like daily challenges, but I found myself coming back only a year after to play the main missions again and finally complete the challengesâ€¦ the wrong way- Last thing I should note here is that the people behind this game have a good sense of humor, youâ€™ll find things such asâ€¦ a videogame called Counter Pandemic I think? Just look at Santa Espire from the 1.4 update log 3 years ago, youâ€™ll get the idea. Oh and you can hit someone with any object you find! Such as a keyboard ^^",Really is an amazing game. It makes me buy another system so I could play the second one. Thatâ€™s how amazing this game is. I played it on normal. Once before now Iâ€™m gonna try it hard and the game is still outstanding. Lots of fun lots of good missions. I hope they add more. ï¿¼,"Visit linktr,ee/gaving7095 for 25 % off this game and many more ðŸ˜€ This stands up well on Quest 2. Title of my review says it all I think ðŸ˜Š But if I had to elaborate, Iâ€™d say that the controls work well, graphics are nice & story pretty good / compelling. Itâ€™s fun to both stealth it up at times or go in guns blazing if you prefer, thereâ€™s scope there for both approaches.",I have played this 2years ago and I habe my progresses and challenge record. But when I wanted to continue yesterday. All gone. I was shocked. I have to repeat to play from the beginning. I played yesterday 5 hours and only reached the mission 3. Very disapointed,I loved this game. The only stealth game better than this one is espire 2. For anybody who plays Zelda this is the ocarina of time and the new one is tears of the kingdom
