The people loved the stunning Irish landscapes and mindfulness meditations, wisdom stories and breathing techniques ...Great array of content and super accessible",360-3D video is not clear enough. U can switch 360-2d pic to keep the high resolution.,"I wanted to love this, the idea is great. To be able to spend some “me time” in VR and mediate in real nature environments is a great concept but it’s been done so much better than this. The main issue for me and the deal breaker is that the environments are flat 2D and the scale is all wrong. To be clear I only tried the free demo so the premium content may well be amazing but if it is that would be a strange business model. The garden environment, apart from being flat was not scaled correctly so instead of you feeling immersed and “in” the garden, you were instead looking AT a flat picture of a tiny garden so it didn’t feel like you were in a relaxing meditation space, it just felt like you were outside it looking at it. To be honest there’s really no excuse in 2021 for flat VR and unfortunately that was enough to make me delete the app. Replace the visuals with immersive 3 dimensional VR and you may be into something."
