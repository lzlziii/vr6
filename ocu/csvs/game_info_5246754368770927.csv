Repossessed,"They called it Possession. Forget No Filter, this was no going back. Possession tinkered with your genes, made you a new you. Let you design a new mask and use it to hide from the world. Gave you an inner glow, skin like a filter, eyes like saucers, big and bright and terribly fragile. Getting Possessed was the difference between having influence and being an Influencer. By the time the cracks started to show the fad was at peak saturation. Even the people who had started it were sick of it. When it started to snap minds, the more cynical of the chattering classes claimed not to see a difference. When they started eating people though. When the infection started to spread from a single bite… that got people to notice. They gather together now, they haunt the spaces we used to share and make them into something else. This building has everything we need. It has power, it has water, it has light. It’s time for Repossession.",18+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Horror, Shooter",English,1.0.48,Home Tree Studio,Home Tree Studio Ltd,https://www.hometreestudio.com/,"Aug 2, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5246754368770927/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5246754368770927&r=1, https://www.hometreestudio.com/privacy-policy",462.3 MB,"The graphics and sound design is amazing on this game with gun whistling when you shoot a far target from the very nice and realistic textures. The only issue this game has is its repetitiveness with each floor, each floor tons of zombies that you have to kill with your two TEC-9's which sounds like fun and is fun for a little under an hour at least. Every single level is the same repetitive murder spree over and over again with the only change being the number of zombies and they're walk speed, though this is still pretty good for $10 and its pretty good for being applab aswell.",Amazing! Though i am a bit biased since I made it. Thanks,Wow this game is awesome !!! Here is where it all started just entering that elevator. When I made it to the 1st floor and those elevator doors opened just the gloomy environment and the sound I was already scared and thought nope I am definitely not gonna make it... Then I realised as I went around the corner and saw rooms full of zombies and they spotted me immediately they headed straight for me. There were times I thought I finished off a room and the next thing I knew I was being attacked from behind or I saw their creepy hand wrapped around the door frame... While playing I realised at that very moment I was the last human being during this zombie apocalypse.,Solid game with nice graphics,"The positives: The developers have nailed the atmosphere. Dark, gloomy and a zombie coming round the corner genuinely makes you jump. Graphics are good, although more varied zombies would be nice. The negatives: Variety is the biggest problem here. There' are 30 odd floors/levels and the only difference I've noticed between the levels are that the zombies move faster. The flashing strobe effect when the guns fire will give someone a seizure, I'm certain of it!!! This is early access, so hopefully there's more to come. As I've said they've nailed the atmosphere, so if they can build from that then this game has potential!!"
