Hauntify Mixed Reality,"Hauntify MR can be played in any type of building including single or multistory! The player must setup their play space using the game's built in features to enhance their experience. We want to give the player creative freedom to create a horror game and place props around their environment. Some ghosts can be summoned in player defined spawn points and other ghosts appear in completely random locations around your house. As you collect more relics, increasing dangerous spirits will be summoned. Hauntify MR features fully dynamic AI that is capable of navigating your house. The different ghost types with have unique abilities. Before playing read the instructions on how to set up your play space. To save your wall setup, exit the app before hitting continue on the first wall spawn menu. Regular updates will occur, this game is in early development. Check out the Hauntify Setup Tutorial Video.

Setting up the play space can be hard at times, but if you ignore the area glitching or moving around, it doesnâ€™t really affect gameplay too much unless you are in an extremely large environment. Like a field with fences and small objects. I completely recommend this game to anyone who loves horror games.",It takes a long time to set up but ITS WORTH IT! So SCARYðŸ‘»,This game is still in development and itâ€™s very good for where itâ€™s at right now. It is a little bit of struggle to place walls and use the buttons but i love the game. I recommend watching his video to set up the game as itâ€™s very detailed and good. Also I gave him feedback to add monster speed modifier and he responded quick so he is still taking suggestions. Love this game would recommend itâ€™s only 5$ very cheap for what it does,I play it on the quest 1 and it's very scary. It's the perfect game to play with friends and scare them! Good job!,If u struggle take a min and chill don't rush things or u get mad
