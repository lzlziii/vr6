I Can just recommand this game, devs are work very well to make a Amazing game. 5 stars you deserve it devs.","I don't think I'm a good enough player for this game. I haven't even managed to turn the generator on yet, mainly because I just run and try and hide from the zombies upstairs. I imagine it would be a lot better in coop mode, but I can't find a way of joining a game. I'm sure it is a very good game, but probably not one for novices."
