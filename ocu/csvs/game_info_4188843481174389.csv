MOTHERGUNSHIP: FORGE,"""A MUST-HAVE VR EXPERIENCE"" ‚ÄîScreen Rant MOTHERGUNSHIP: FORGE is a frantic VR FPS roguelite where players craft powerful hand-held weapons and struggle to survive‚Äîer defeat‚Äîthe MOTHERGUNSHIP. ""Incredibly well-made roguelite shooter with a tight loop and innovative mechanics. Its fun, gripping gameplay makes it one of the best VR shooters out there.‚Äù ‚ÄîAndroid Central Survive the MOTHERGUNSHIP‚Äôs metal minions and earn gun parts to add to your weapon, easily picking them up and snapping them into place in VR.

You could play start to finish several times a day for the rest of your life and never come close to building the same gun twice. There are literally millions of potential combinations. Mothergunship: Forge is my go-to shooter.,"I love this game and it is very unique. I love the fact that is a dungeon crawler and leaves you dodging between bullets. The reason you should choose this game instead of other shooters is because you build your gun, you pick a part and connect it to your hand and open fire! You will not be disappointed.","So in the new update I was trying to join a multiplayer game and it said to finish the game I was in with a different person and there no button to say ‚Äúend game‚Äù so I can‚Äôt play multiplayer, which sucksüòû. But overall the game is great Up date I just got one and it was fine, must have been a glitch","This game is definitely a must have title for anyone looking for a good shooter game or a game to play with a friend. The graphics are really good which really adds to the gameplay. I‚Äôve never encountered a bug of any kind while playing, the gameplay is very smooth. My favorite part of this game though is the variety. There are hundreds of different attachments which makes for millions of different combinations. There are also tons of different rooms with different enemies each time. No two games could ever be the same which means the game never gets old. Overall 10/10 stars and hope the devs will continue to update this game. Would definitely suggest to anyone looking for another great shooter or co-op game to their library."
