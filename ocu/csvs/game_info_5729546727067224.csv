Billionaires Show,"Have you ever wondered what happens inside the mind of a participant who is testing his knowledge on live TV? You have seen it and knew the answers to the questions but you weren’t in his or her shoes to answer them… Well, now it is time to test your skills and fulfill your destiny! We are happy to welcome you to the Billionaires Show, a show held within a space station, where you get to answer 30 questions in order to be part of the Billionaires Club and engrave your name forever to the game. You get 4 superpowers to help you answer different questions from all kinds of fields such as history, science, art, sports, space, movies, and more. We are aware that every TV Show needs a sponsor, and since we wanted to give something in return to our players, we have created a special place for the “extraterrestrials”, the ones who are knowledge-driven and highly competitive. If you manage to answer all 30 questions and be part of the Billionaires Club, you will be treated as one. You’ll get to promote your Oculus profile for 10 days to other players who are testing their skills in the show at any time...for free. And if that is not enough, you can always sponsor again by investing your billions and promoting what is valuable to you! Our goal is to give all players the most realistic experience that a real-life TV show could give, to entertain and learn more within the journey. For now, we have only one question: Are you ready to become a billionaire?",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Education, Simulation",English,1.27,Spontan Creative Media,Spontan Creative Media,https://vr.spontan.agency/,"Jul 6, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5729546727067224/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5729546727067224&r=1, https://vr.spontan.agency/?page_id=71",589.5 MB,"I've always dreamt of being part of a thrilling TV game show where I could put my knowledge to the test and have a chance to win some serious money. This game has exceeded all my expectations, providing an exhilarating experience that combines the excitement of a TV show with the thrill of trivia.",A fun and challenging experience for Quest,"I have been a game show junkie my entire life so grabbed this game as soon as I saw it. It is exactly what you expect it to be!! The game is superbly done and so much fun to play. I hope to see more game shows in VR in the future! Answer 30 questions and become a BILLIONAIRE! Sounds easy enough but the questions are pretty challenging! You will truly test your wit, but thankfully you have 4 superpowers to help you- 50/50, ask the audience, change question, and next question but use them wisely! There are also ways to earn or purchase coins to gain even more superpowers too. While this is a single player game, I think casting to the TV and having the entire family help is so much fun...and now we know who is smarter in the family! LOL Add this to your family fun night or test your smarts solo, either way- I think everyone will enjoy this game!!","As someone who grew up watching game shows, hearing about this game was super exciting! If you've ever wanted to know what it's like to be on a TV game show, download this game immediately... you can thank me later!"
