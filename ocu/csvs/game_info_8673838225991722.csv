People who ask have a 0% chance of getting it. Enjoy DodgeVr. -soap (moderator)",Hello owner of Dodgevr I would like to ask you a question in your game.,1)if you like a game with more little kids than any other game play this one if you don‚Äôt then don‚Äôt play it this game is full of little kids 2)a rule that says no cussing if your trying to make a little kid game then make a app not a vr game because vr is for 13 and up you should expect cussing 3)the game isn‚Äôt mostly what the title says but it still has dodge ball it doesn‚Äôt really work 4)the moderators in this game are kinda abusing there power but they don‚Äôt really show it also if you join their discord and say that the something is bad or something they will mute you for speaking out I‚Äôve seen it happen 5)the community is fine it‚Äôs just full of little kids if you join the game you would most likely find a little kid playing it (means something different from number 1) 6)most of the reviews are little kids probably idk 7) i probably might get ban from the discord for speaking out 8) don‚Äôt join the discord üëç,"The infection gamemode has crossed the line when it comes to it. 1. You can tag the infected which means little kids will tag you for no reason. 2. That become monkeh button that gives a gateway for when you tag a player they will just go for the button maybe you should just add a thing so that when everyone is tagged the game restarts and one person becomes infected. 3. The hit boxes are so broken. 4. Toxic children are everywhere in this gamemode, if someone says the n-word I will delete the game and tell everyone on how your community is toxic. In conclusion, please do not play the infection gamemode."
