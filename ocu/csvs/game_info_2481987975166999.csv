Accounting+,"How long have these goggles been pressing into my flesh? What began as a small game jam between William Pugh (The Stanley Parable), Dominik Johann (Minit) and Justin Roiland (Rick and Morty) is now—two years later—an aberration of warped technology, weird worlds and strange, disturbing creatures. Since its debut, Accounting has tripled in size, mutated into an intricate labyrinth of forbidden virtual realities. With countless more secrets to discover if you have the stomach to brave the dangers of new characters brought to life by a cast of comedic legends (Rich Fulcher, Reggie Watts, and Justin Roiland). DANGERS - If you die in VR, you die in real life. - Do not play after midnight. - Achievements linked to unforgivable acts of human corruption. - A way better soundtrack than a VR game soundtrack has any right to be. - Subtitles and translations for 9 languages. Wow, internationally dangerous! - The vacuum of space. Yeah that dangerous. - And unfortunately: The Cops.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Interactive Story","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish (Spain)",1.24.35,Crows Crows Crows,Crows Crows Crows,http://accountingpl.us/,"Jul 3, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2481987975166999/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2481987975166999&r=1, https://crowscrowscrows.com/privacy/",Terms of Service,2.07 GB,Loved everything about it. Wished there was more!,Good,"The more you play this game the more you get out of it. There are hidden levels and a secret zoo level (never been found) The first time I played the game I thought it was short but after looking for all the levels and trying to work out clues for the secret zoo level I have spent quite a long time on this game. Great game and great humour, loads of easter eggs to find.","Wow! I had no idea what to expect from the dudes that brought me ""Trover Saves the Universe"", but I was totally blown away by the depth of humor and creative structure of the thingy thing! Thank you Dev's! Hope to see more Coming Soon!",I finished this super quickly like in 3 hours but it was super funny I did laugh and I smiled the most I have ever smiled before but there is some kinks for 1 it was way too short like I said before you will probably get like 6 hours tops I did it in 3 and there is one bit near the end that made me super uncomfortable like super uncomfortable if you want to know why and what bit that is scroll down because it will be a spoiler and I don't want to ruin it for people who want to play it It was really good over all other than a two main things the rest was great I kinda recommend Ok this is the spoiler In one level idk exactly there is this really wierd looking dude with super long arms and legs and he was saying some wierd stuff I get this is meant to be a joke like this is you ha ha ha but I just found it super uncomfortable if you don't like that sort of stuff maybe this isn't for you i enjoyed most of it but not all of it hopefully this helped
