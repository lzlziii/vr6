A Rogue Escape,"Your plan was simple: steal a giant, crawling mech, also known as a Nauticrawl, evade capture, and make a break for freedom. Find clues to unravel your whereabouts, but know - this is only the first of your many problems... To go further, you will have to explore the giant machine from top to bottom to learn the steps necessary to make it move. Pull levers, flip switches, and experiment with everything. But beware of what other dangers lie beyond the horizon‚Ä¶ A Rogue Escape is a more tactile, experience-driven VR re-imagination of Spare Parts Oasis' first title: Nauticrawl. The player anticipated VR adventure offers a new and highly immersive experience for new and existing fans alike! -Test your intuition by mastering 5 distinct control centers within the Nauticrawl -In-game adjustable floor for players of all heights -Playable in 9 languages",7+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Puzzle, Simulation","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Spain)",1.0,Spare Parts Oasis,Armor Games Studios,https://armorgamesstudios.com/games/rogue-escape/,"Jun 10, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3816141331792031/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3816141331792031&r=1, https://armorgamesstudios.com/privacy",1.18 GB,"If you like puzzle games and if you also liked Iron Lung, this game is for you, my playthrough took about 2 hours, but i‚Äôd say it might take 1-1.5 hours for a good puzzler. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying it on it‚Äôs own full price, so get it on sale or in a bundle, I got it in the bundle alongside Myst, for a game I thought ‚ÄúEh, it looks decent and I might as well get it since I want Myst‚Äù but it decently surprised me, no tutorials or tips or hints, this game gives you no hand holding and leaves you to figure everything out. It only gives you a basic understanding of what to do through a tablet. There are 4 rooms in total, and fun gameplay, with roguelike mechanics, if you die, your Nauticrawl is where it died and you have to grab the stuff. Short game, would recommend if you see it in a bundle","Underrated gem. The puzzles and movement mechanics are very unique and cool! Worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot and remove spaces): t i n y u r l , c o m / r o g u e e s c a p e","First time in my Quest 2 ownership that a game just won‚Äôt work. Once I finally got it to download and tried to Start the game, it froze. Nothing would ever go past the first chamber within the language menu. I uninstalled it and tried to start over after several said to do that. Won‚Äôt install. I spent 3 days and ran through the battery and it disappeared and went to the previously installed section. After several months of trying to fix this i would have to say i am not happy. Sent emails messages so. Ow this review.","Warning: this review contains spoilers. Basically, 80% of the game is you figuring out the mechanics of each control station; like the crawler module. Once you‚Äôve figured them out, and a couple of new tricks, you‚Äôre good to go. The story feels underdeveloped for me, though, and more content is needed, but since the main game IS the mechanics, I won‚Äôt complain. Also, what is that ending? Like if you‚Äôre about to shoot through outer space, why are the windows open? Shouldn‚Äôt they be closed? And why does the outside still look like you‚Äôre still here? Then there‚Äôs the ‚Äòyou shouldn‚Äôt be here‚Äô message at the end of your start through space; ending up with you back at the elevator. I‚Äôm theorizing that either this MIGHT be a daydream as you hear breathing when you transition back to the elevator, or simply the capitol caught you, before you warped out of this planet, and decided to play along with your ‚Äòescape‚Äô. The crawler module detaching from your cabin ship is a bit suspicious as if the capitol is preparing you for transport back to the one place you wanted to escape from, or I‚Äôm overthinking this. I also know that this was a ramble, but I don‚Äôt really care. ,",Very fun a little hard and creepy please add level select and access to all levels and multiplayer mode really cool graphics perfect performance I played for a month non stopü§î‚ù§Ô∏èüò∏ hard to control
