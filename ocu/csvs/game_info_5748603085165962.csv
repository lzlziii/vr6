Reward code: 8769 Thornton2270","This game is super fun, it is an action packed shooter, with snipers, pistols and rifles, it is like no other. You can play it with your friends, there are hidden guns too. I highly recommend this game.",This is a great little fun shooter. I like the cartoon style. Challenging and fun. Doesn't take itself seriously and you will play with a smile. Great value and replayability. Maybe need to work on the voice acting .. but we'll done guys .. cracking little game! Andy P 2593,"I’m a 56 yo female tech geek and this is my favorite shooter game. Easy to reload - just press A or bring the gun to your waist. My 23 yo son and I play in co-op mode￼. Several different levels and environments keep it very exciting. The enemy’s bullets come at you in slow motion so you can dodge them so you don’t get killed right away like some of the more complex FPS games.￼ The sights on guns are realistic and help tremendously when killing your targets. Or you can instinctively shoot & do ok too, especially with closer targets. As a retired State Trooper, it emulates out live tactical training - Hiding behind targets, taking cover and taking down the enemies. ￼Sneaking around the mall and killing the intruders is super fun. You go in all these different stores and rooms and find different guns and shields and other weapons. Very exciting and engaging game.￼ As far as comfort, use the left joystick to teleport & the right for smooth walking or running and you will never get motion sickness.￼","I love this game. I play it every day. Im hoping for more coop levels soon! Its so much fun with other players! Cmon devs, add more coop levels and this game will be complete!!!! Username: SEVENSYNZ BARCODE: 9405"
