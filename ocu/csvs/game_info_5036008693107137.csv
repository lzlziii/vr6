Thanks to Sidequestvr.com it's now possible to play this kickass title on Quest2. Just love everything about this game. The camera view and angles are ace. The sound is good. The animations are brilliant. Just a really cool game and something different for VR. What other titles have the Dev's made as I'd like to play more from these dudes. Thanks such a cool game!!!,"For $10, this has got to be one of the best bang for buck games in the oculus store there is. There is a single player campaign, multiplayer vs, coop and survival mode. Please keep updating this game. This is the best top down shooter on quest, hands down, so far!","controls very well with touch controllers as gamepad, good graphics, awesome perspective in VR as if you're playing a regular game in a holographic projector. Wish there were more such games trying this. it's good, but with just 8 missions there's neither much to do nor enough to do besides the single mechanic from the very beginning: dodge and shoot. I also played in co-op with a few different players, there seems to be enough of them, possibly mobile phone users or from switch...",This is a great game but Iâ€™ve had trouble playing co-op and online game play. If you could help me resolve this it would be much appreciated.
