Paranormal Inspector,"As Inspector Franklin, a rookie police detective, you are assigned to resolve different paranormal cases. Case 1: Prichard State Hospital explore the mystery behind Prichard State Hospital where a team of student researchers of the paranormal have gone missing while studying hauntings at the sanitarium in a small, spooky New England town. What looks like an ordinary missing person case will turn out to be anything but as you look for evidence, explore the haunted hallways and come face-to-face with the ghostly presence haunting the cursed hospital. Can you solve the mystery behind the missing students and uncover the troubled past of the hospital before itâ€™s too late? Case 2: Seven School Mysteries In a quiet town, there is an abandoned school. Legend has it that seven incredible events occur in this school, known as the ""Seven School Myst"". These events seem to be related to the paranormal and the mysterious atmosphere of the campus. However, there is a reasonable explanation behind every event, but for various reasons, it has been rendered into a mysterious legend.

Just stop it. I've seen it in used like close to a dozen VR spooky crapllications since 2015. On top of that, it's as dark, and cumbersome and as you can expect. Darkness in VR sucks, but then stuff like this makes you hold a cell phone and a flashlight and it's just a big blurry pixelated pain.","I loved playing this! It scared me half to death trying to figure out what to do. The part where you get the crystal and there are the skeleton werewolves creeped me out. But when I heard howling after I picked up the crystal I thought those things were about to come after me, and I instantly quit the game. But after some time I finally beat it. It's a short game, but a scary game. It has its bugs here and there. Like one of the staircases. I found out I was able to climb the staircase you were not meant to go through, and when I had to go back down, it wouldn't let me go back down the steps. I think that's my fault and not the game. I also found out that if you turn on a flashlight or lighter and put it in your inventory, it stays on forever, even when it's meant to turn off. So that's good and very helpful when it gets dark. Anyway, I loved playing this, and I hope it gets more levels and maybe even multiplayer!"
