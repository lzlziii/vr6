Exolibrium,"During an explorational expedition deep within the unknown regions of space, your team has crossed paths with something truly... alien. The entire crew has perished, the power has been cut, and you are all that remains. Take control of a fully physical and accurately calibrated avatar in your fight against the mysterious alien species known as the 'Prolomyte' as they attempt to hunt down and harvest every last remaining crewmember aboard the vessel.

Customize your own character 7. Add different aliens 8. Add different weapons There is potential in this game reminds me of Alien vs. Predator movie. I hope to see it get a update!,"There's potential here for an amazing game. The graphics are pretty good, although (as far as I know) you are just stuck in the same corridor for the whole game and the physics of your character is superb. I haven't progressed very far, but hopefully there are loads of different types of aliens to fight, different locations and also a wide range of weapons to use. The weapon you do have feels terrible to use and gives you no real sense if you are hitting anything. That put me off as soon as I started playing, and I was hoping for a different gun, preferably one you hold with both hands, but so far nothing. As I say, there's potential here for an amazing game if they expand on what it is at the moment, but unfortunately at the moment, for me, it's a game that feels nothing more than just a demo. Disappointing.",The graphics are good needs a little more improvement,It just needs emergency reloads,This could be Awesome. I would love to see this turned into a roguelike. Plz keep going! Thanks.
