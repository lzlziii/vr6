The colors alone make me happy when I play this. Building the cities and making the spacefolk ""happy"" is relaxing, and it is interesting enough to keep me engaged for hours at a time. The game has a sandbox mode, which I have yet to play. I assume it is where you can freely build the cities without necessarily having an end goal. I have been playing in the other mode where you are given objectives before building each city. Each level of this mode seems to increase in the number of objectives, giving you exposure to different tools and elements of the game. I almost see it as a (very) loose tutorial of sorts. To get the most out of Spacefolk City, I recommend watching the Developers' walk-through on YouTube and joining the Discord. Otherwise, just jump in and have fun creating your own cities in Space!","It's fairly simple, build homes to attract people and a few other buildings to make them happy. The challenge comes from trying to build everything within range of the power buildings, there's no ability to extend the range of power which is the greatest limitation of the game. I paid $3.99 on sale and I feel that was a great price for the fun I'm having.",So addicted to this game. Been playing it constantly. Makes you feel happy with the bright colours and quirky-ness. Sweet little characters. Loving sandbox mode and specials where I can play pirates.. Halloween and Christmas. Fantastic game.,"Favorite game! Endless creativity, and these little creatures will make you forget about time. 😍 You can build a city for hours and it never gets boring. And watching the inhabitants of the town is a pleasure. Thanks to the creators of the game for this masterpiece! So everything worked out to the smallest detail. There are just no words ❤️ Loooooove! 🍕🌭🍿🥑🍋 🍌"
