So I'm probably spoiled now that I played Moss I and II... the graphics and the music were so incredible. But this game sounded interesting and was on sale, so I decided to try it. Uhhg... I am seriously gonna try to get my money back. First, the graphics are really quite awful. Every turn requires a black out and screen reload... so it's not a true VR world, it's just multiple 3D scenes you can switch between. And the whole game is point and click to move this bird from one spot to another. (Note: You are not the bird, you control the bird. I thought this might give me a sense of flying. Nope. You're just high up most of the time.) And then the story line seems really umm... twisted. You find a young girl - what, 8? 10? And she's CHAINED to a container. Who chains a little girl in a box???? You have to electrocute her to free her. What??? And everything is about electricity in a war destroyed maze city. The city makes absolutely no sense (like even before it was destroyed by bombshells). But as soon as you free the girl, you just point and click to difference places and then sit there... and sit there... while she goes through the maze and catches up to you and opens a door to give you a new place to fly to, so you can sit and wait for her to catch up again. THATS LIKE-- the whole game!! Trying to get her to follow you (or you follow her) so you can find new ""electrical"" points you can fly to. Oh, and then she kinda ""dies""... and you pretty much have to let her just to get through a door... and becomes like a ghost. Which is very sick and twisted of a game to do. Again, she's this cute little girl. Doesn't speak English or anything... but she is the ONLY real color of the whole game. (I'm pretty sure the rest of the game has less than 10 colors all in washed out yellows and grays.) And then cuz it's a weird game, she comes back. But it's still just point, click, fly, and wait. And your trigger buttons are the only thing that do anything... all other buttons open the menu. Pretty sure this was created by beginner VR designers and coders. Oh, and music? Nothing but a surreal, probably computer generated, background ""ambiance"". Not real music or anything that adds to the game play. I'm sorry. I was not only extremely bored, but those drawn to the game might be because of the bird, which means possible nature lovers and there's little to no nature in this, save for some horses you have to throw lightening at to get them to move, or maybe VR lovers, and it's not a true VR environment, or people who like puzzles, and these are fairly mundane and stupid, and all those types of people will be extremely disappointed if they're looking for a beautiful game, with interesting game play. Don't waste your money. If you love nature, or beauty, music, or really interesting puzzles and story lines that promote good (not show and promote serious messed up evil to a little kids)... go buy Moss instead. Or at least if you enjoyed Moss, you WONT likely enjoy this!","I don't hate it, but don't see the point of it either. It seems to be a story mode experience (very few real choices). However, the story doesn't really make any sense. So if you aren't playing it for the game play, and you aren't playing it for the story, then why? The art is beautiful and it has a very serene vibe to it. So I guess if you're not a gamer, just want something to do, and don't need a story with closure, this might be for you. Maybe my elderly mother would like it. Again, I didn't hate it, but I am confused by it.","I love the art style, and terrorizing the girl with passive electrical threats.","This game is like being inside a poem. It takes you on a moody, enigmatic journey that touches on themes of innocence, evil, awe, terror, whimsy, and loss. I finished it months ago, and it still haunts me. Unforgettable.",This was a beautiful adventure puzzle game. I was delighted. :-)
