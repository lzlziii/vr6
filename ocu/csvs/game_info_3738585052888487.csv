Project Snowflake,"From 1967 until 1985, guests at Disneyland had the opportunity to ‚Äùtravel into the incredible universe found within a tiny fragment of a snowflake."" The attraction, Adventure Thru Inner Space, sought to use the tools of cinematic set design to explore the lessons of science, with massive structures representing water molecules and elaborate projection revealing the microscopic world of the atom. The ride was developed during Walt Disney's final years, when he repeatedly explored how the tools of filmmaking might be repurposed to explore worlds beyond cinema in his theme park. Adventure Thru Inner Space was groundbreaking not only in introducing the Omnimover and by creating an attraction almost wholly focused on backgrounds (with no characters except for the onboard narration) but in the way it arranged dramatic, themed space toward educational goals.",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","360 Experience (non-game), Documentary & History, Educational",English,1,Cranky Something Studios,Disney History Institute,https://www.disneyhistoryinstitute.com/recreations,"Mar 30, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3738585052888487/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3738585052888487&r=1, https://www.disneyhistoryinstitute.com/2021/02/virtual-recreation-privacy-policy.html",737.7 MB,"I was so looking forward to seeing this. This version, that I downloaded on 3.October.2022, is now a very simplified schematic of little color, black and white contrasty shapes and NO realistic experience of what I remember this attraction being. I recall there being a MUCH better version that was still in development. What happened to that one??","I can only think those positive reviews are fake? This is all flat black and white, boring, purposeless.","This is phenomenal and I am so thankful to experience this since I was never able to go to the real deal. If I could offer one suggestion, I know this ride had a feature with speakers built into the ride capsules, and if there is a way to incorporate spatial audio to mimic the effect of those speakers, that would take this to the next level. I'm also not sure if the ride itself made any noise as it moved along but maybe a ""track"" noise would also help with immersion? Thanks again devs!",üíñThank you so much.üíñI love your game.üíñ,"Went to Disney World in November for the first time and then spent a lot of time learning about its history, reading books, listening to podcasts, and even doing a course on theme park design. I started planning a VR app that would allow you to experience an imaginary ride, but never followed through. Great execution. Hope to see more content like this in the future."
