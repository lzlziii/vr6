BEHIND THE WINDOW,"The experience is a visual journey in the art project by Fabio Santoro ""Behind the Window"". Is a visual path that aims to explore the complexity of human condition in modern society. In the rooms of this visionary gallery, the paintings will lead you through the exploration of the complexity of the human condition in modern society. The shop windows, symbolically become in these paintings the theatrical set where the modern life of the great western metropolis is staged, and the mannequins are just a ploy to represent ourselves, the dynamics of our lives, the relationships and bonds that we create, but at the same time to undress our real needs, instincts and feelings, exploring the contradictions and peculiarities of a society increasingly standardized and consumerist.",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity",English,"6
