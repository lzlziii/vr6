Blair Witch: Oculus Quest Edition,"Blair Witch: Oculus Quest Edition is a story-driven psychological horror game based on the cinematic lore of Blair Witch. As Ellis, a former police officer with a troubled past, join the search for a missing boy in the iconic Black Hills Forest near Burkittsville, Maryland. What starts as an ordinary investigation soon will make you confront your darkest nightmares - and an ominous force known as the Blair Witch. But you’re not going in alone: your trusty K-9 sidekick, Bullet, is by your side. He’s your eyes, ears, and nose in these treacherous and terrifying woods. The game has been rebuilt for Oculus Quest to offer a uniquely immersive and horrifying VR experience. With environments redesigned for more interactivity, new Bullet mechanics - such as gesture commands, actual hand-based petting and fetching - and additional creature encounters, you will experience the eerie atmosphere of the Black Hills Forest like never before. These cursed woods will awaken your darkest fears.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Horror, Interactive Story","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Spain)",1.46,Bloober Team,Bloober Team NA,https://blairwitchgame.com/,"Oct 29, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2799962826754702/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=2799962826754702&r=1, https://blairwitchgame.com/docs/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,3.98 GB,"bio DOT link / spearzoz Here's the link to get 7.50$ OFF if you want to buy this awesome game (make sure to remove all spaces and replace ""DOT"" with the dot character).

I'd really appreciate a thumbs up if you found useful the previous link or the following review. =) Here's my review ^-^ Blair Witch is a chilling psychological horror game that skillfully captures the essence of the iconic film while crafting its own unsettling narrative. Developed by Bloober Team, the game follows Ellis, a former police officer, as he searches for a missing child in the foreboding Black Hills Forest. The game's atmospheric visuals and haunting sound design immerse players in a terrifying world. As you traverse the dark and eerie forest, the sense of isolation and dread intensifies, complemented by the howling wind and eerie echoes. Blair Witch uses clever lighting tricks and shifting environments to blur the lines between reality and hallucinations, keeping players on edge and questioning their own sanity. With a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving, the gameplay remains engaging. Armed with a flashlight and camcorder, you navigate the labyrinthine paths and solve enigmas while avoiding an unseen terror. The camcorder's ability to manipulate time and reveal hidden clues adds depth to the experience. Blair Witch excels at building tension and dread without resorting to jump scares, instead relying on psychological horror elements. It skillfully plays on your fears and imagination, making it an unsettling and immersive adventure. Though it may have pacing issues and combat mechanics could be refined, the game's ability to evoke genuine fear cements it as a must-play for horror enthusiasts. If you dare to face the darkness within the Black Hills Forest, Blair Witch will leave you breathless with fear and fascination.","I want to give this game at least 4 stars but I just can’t do it. Nothing wrong with the storyline or the scares, but the scale of the glitches within the game make it extremely unplayable. The amount of times I fell through the map or got stuck mid-floor made this a very frustrating game to play. I would have hoped that they would have resolved any glitches before releasing the game. Very disappointing.","Great horror game, finally something with a decent story. Beginning is quite slow and boring but when we finally reach the cabin...","I played this for a bit, liked the beginning, but couldn’t relate to the character, and then i got to the camp and it didn’t seem like anything was going to happen (like the boring movie) so i returned it. Later it was on sale so i bought it again and played it off and on. Unlike the movie, things do happen in this game. I really enjoyed walking around in the woods and I enjoyed the spookier parts. I didn’t figure everything out but was still able to complete the game. I don’t usually startle but there was 1 really good jump scare at the end. If you enjoy exploring woods in a creepy setting with occasional scares while trying to solve a mystery this may be the game for you. If you don’t and want a lot of action this may not be the game for you.","First of the reson why im not rating this game five stars. in the beginning it was a little slow and character grow was a little slow in my opinion and the bond wasn't really conecting as far a story should go. I felt through out the game i often felt confused and back in go a corner. in the cabin i felt like i could really use my flashlight do to alot of events all at once and not full grasping the concept. Reson why im rating this four stars is simply die to the concept of the game as a whole and the story as a whole. During the beginning parts of the story it plays out slow and steady reeling you into tge plot and narratives of what trama does to some people an the negative things that happen due to the trama. I aslo enjoyed the ambiant sound ask you travers the wood i found my self often looking back makeing sure nothing was following me. I found amazment at the creature detail and appearance when first encountering the tree creature it gave me a good scare same with the creatrue on the tracks that was a good jump. My personal favorite was haveing bullet to be honest him being there made the whole experience a whole lot better and i oftenfound safty with bullet as he guidwd me thru the forest. Lastthing is tge game machanics where great from the flashlight alll the way to the whisle i loved it i enjoyed how using the camera my help you find clues, answer question, open doors or even warn you of ipcoming dangers. The flashlight of course has to be mentioned you have no idea how help the flashlight was. The dog whistle was a good tool in which being able to comand bullet was very helpfull. This is the end of my review of blair witch thank you agian for such an awsome game keep up thegood work all of you at Bloober studios"
