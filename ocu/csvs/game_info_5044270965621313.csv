Zong,"Your initial location will be the Cave of Centiwell, where you get to meet one of the Supreme Commanders in the current era of Anima Gravis. The Commander will talk to you about the hardships Zong is going through and what your mission would be. In the 2nd level, at the exit of Centiwell, you will be standing on a battlefield, facing Boreas Gorge. The Osteospectral Tiger whose skin is transparent has sensed your smell coming from human earth and would come to your life, would you survive? In the 3rd level, you will be standing on the battlefield of the 2nd level, once Sol — the Supreme Commander you met in the 1st level — recites the Mantra Kardia, the Bridge of Atmos will appear. Under the bridge, the Captives who have committed wrong are hanging upside down with ankles tied. As human’s weight is heavier than that of beings in Zong, once you step onto the bridge, the Captives would wake up and come to your life, would you survive? 4th level of Zong is coming soon.",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Adventure, RPG",English,1.21,Beijing Uni Technologies,Beijing Uni Technologies,https://zongvr.net/,"Jul 7, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5044270965621313/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5044270965621313&r=1, https://zongvr.net/policy",526.5 MB,Really admire the creator's dedication to making a serious Chinese culture VR game. Heard the script was originally drafted in ancient Chinese and hired a couple of translators to translate it into English. Love to see what comes next. Though I feel like an interactive movie (also a game) also suits the script. Wonder why choose a game over an interactive movie?,"I will, it does have glitches and does have some unsinct dialog at the beginning but it just gets better. The combat system is fun and easy to learn. And might I add the dev(s) of it are super sweet, it has a good story, I would reccomend this game to any new vr owners,","This is a historical and unprecedented experience I’ve never ever seen in VR!!!! The concept is wholly new and the characters so are innovative!!! You just never see in any games!!! By any. I mean like in computers games or just any games. I mean, games say that they are building a world but they actually are NOT!!! By building a world, you need to establish the rules in which the world is following, though it’s just two levels of release, you can see the bad guys attributes and the rules differentiating humankind and beings in Zong. Beijing Uni Technologies, I mean, this team has TRUELY leveraged the power of VR, I’m super amazed by these brand new concepts, and the tiger on the CliffSide really intimidated me a lot!!!! I mean, what’s the purpose of VR????? It gotta to be something that extend your curiosity to the more magical as well as more mysterious world!!!! You just have to try this!!!! Zong is the most mysterious world Ive ever seen in VR, you just find yourself so immersed and so eager to pursue for something further in this world!!!! Kind note: The storytelling of the first level is a bit long, and it took me long time to understand what the character was saying, but after listening again, I understand why these “heavy” storytelling played in the first level, it’s a MUST for you to understand Zong, and to be able to proceed, this is an EXTREMELY SERIOUS game, it’s not a “play and forget”, you will just be living in this world if you can and you will. I can’t wait to try the third level!!! Please release!!!","It introduces you to a brand new world with really thoughtful and mystery scenes. The complexity of the characters and concepts amazed me. Although I wish the conversations could be shorter, it takes quite some time to finish."
