This is a VISUAL NOVEL. I can sort of see why some reviewers gave 1 star, but they definitely aren’t appreciating it for what it REALLY is. Also, if anyone’s asking WHO would even buy this VN for 39.99… ME. I WOULD BUY THIS. MINOR SPOILERS I love visual novels. I mostly play them on flat screen, but this experience made me want to only experience them in VR. I really liked the Ariadne feature to go back and forth, and the different choices and endings you could see. Although it’s more of a “cutscene”, the mech fights were actually epic, having the perspective of being in the pilot seat. The character models are also really well done, I love all of their designs. The military uniform on all characters is very fashionable. ALSO MYDEAREST, THE MUSIC IS AMAZING. Absolute peak. I will be adding its OST to my playlist heheh. Suggestions… The only thing I have to say that I’d want in any future title is a calendar system, it’s always made visual novels more immersive even on flatscreen. So imagine in VR with characters you interact with… I loved the story, characters, music, the UI, everything!!! I hope to see more from you guys, MyDearest. See you at the end.. or the beginning?","Not an action game. Wasted my time hoping for cool mech fights I'd actively participate in. Spent 40$ on a ""game"" that's more cutscene than video game and I can't return it. Really frustrating considering that 40$ could've gone to a VR game I'd really enjoy.",If you love anime you will love this. Sit back relax and enjoy the music in the battle scenes!,"The novelty of being in the pilot seat of a mech can only carry you so far. Overall I will admit this game had phenomenal potential, and wasted nearly all of it. In the entire game I experienced only 2 fight scenes and using the term “fight” is a HUGE stretch. They barely lasted 30 seconds and were 100% predicted and practically choreographed. There’s no element of surprise, control, or choice in it at all. To call them fight scenes would diminish what it means to fight in any game. Let alone what I’ve come to hope for in a mech game. I will say however beautiful story writing and artwork. If you came for a beautiful visual novel then I give it 4 stars. But if you want anything remotely action based this is NOT the game for you. I detest returning games lol Ben those I find lacking I don’t want to return but this is one I would be willing to return. It’s only redeeming quality is the beauty of the visual design.",I wanna cry on Noa main girl Yamato nice. Julie ... Mecha robot epic scenes!!!
