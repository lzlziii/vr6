Squingle,"Now with HAND TRACKING and PASSTHROUGH support! Before time there was only Squingle – and she needs your help to create the Universe! Squingle is a “surreal, clever, and addictive” psychedelic VR puzzle experience, where you must guide rotating orbs through a series of increasingly complex cosmic 3D mazes. With mesmerising iridescent visuals, a progressive electronic soundtrack, and a story of transcendence, Squingle is becoming a cult classic with the highest user rating of any Quest game on the entire Quest game ecosystem (at time of writing). And critics agree! “Brilliantly creative” ~ RoadToVR 10/10 - “The perfect VR game.” ~ Zimtok5 93% - ""A masterpiece.” ~ RuffTalkVR 9.1/10 - ""One of the most fascinating and original things ever seen.” ~ VRItalia “A great puzzle game.” ~ UploadVR 91% - “One of a kind.” ~ VRGameCritic Solve ingenious puzzles, overtake friends in Leaderboards, race your own ghost, and unlock all Achievements.

It is unlike any puzzle game I've played in VR, and the only thing that comes close is that party game where you guide a loop over a metal course, trying not to touch the side otherwise an alarm goes off. Where do I start? The atmospheric sounds and music add a fantastic ambiance to the game as you journey through increasingly difficult and devious levels. The graphics are a mix of psychedelic backgrounds and crystal clear puzzle elements. The levels themselves are exceptionally well thought out as you not only move left to right, right to left or up and down, you also have to move forward and back (in and out) which brings a whole new level of deviousness with you having to either move the puzzle around or move yourself around the puzzle. As you complete each level and move to the next the difficulty level rises little by little to some clever, difficult levels. Luckily there are ""save"" points within some of the puzzles that you activate by moving your orb over so if you fail you start from that point, mid level. Overall this is an excellent addition to the Quest library, and really is a game you have to play. Hats off to the game dev for thinking out of the box and coming up with this game design and bringing it to us.","Although the concept here is not revolutionary, Squingle is a simple puzzle/maze game presented in a colorful, trippy package. I still haven't exactly figured out the mechanics of the rating system and what does or doesn't allow one to unlock anf advance to the next level, but maybe that will become clearer as I complete more puzzles.","I loved playing this game… it was calming while challenging and I really enjoyed the music / graphics. Very unique, definitely recommend.","Squingle is one of the most beautiful, unique, chalenging yet relaxing games that I've come across in a long time. Ive tried tons and tons of applab and official quest store games. Squingle is easily at the top of the list as one of my favorites. At just over $10, its an absolute must buy for any vr headset owner. On the fence? Try the demo out > search ""Squingle Demo"" > scroll down to ""app lab""","A total mind trip. It plays like the video, but you have to be immersed in it to appreciate how good it is. Sounds, visuals and responsive haptics are just stunning. It starts off fairly easy and I was trying to rush through to get a good time. That does not work as it starts to get more difficult. It really does persuade you into a calmer state to be able to find the flow. Amazing game/experience. I wish I knew about this sooner ￼"
