Space Walk VR Experience,"Go for a Space Walk and feel the vastness of space with your Oculus Quest. Three adventure levels: The Earth: Exit the space shuttle and chill out, orbiting over any part of The Earth. Set the time-of-day to view sunrises and night lights. Complete challenges to recover satellites to the space shuttle. Save The World! An asteroid is heading towards Earth. Navigate through the asteroid's tunnels to plant explosives and destroy it in a race against time. 15 levels with 3 levels of difficulty. The Space Station: Float around the outside of the Space Station and view the fully working Canadarm remote arm and visiting HTV supply vessels. Complete a puzzle fixing solar panels - randomly different puzzle every time. Not everyone is cut out to be an astronaut so if you suffer motion sickness in VR, this app probably isn't for you. Turning off Earth position animations, using the trigger button to thrust in the direction you are looking and making slow turns will all help.",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Flying, Simulation, Space/Universe",English,7.0.107.02,Forward Thinking Interactive,Forward Thinking Interactive,http://forwardthinkinginteractive.com/,"Mar 22, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3310986842346589/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3310986842346589&r=1, http://forwardthinkinginteractive.com/privacypolicy",731.0 MB,"The designers have done a magnificent job of creating a realistic environment. You absolutely feel like your floating in space There are several EVA missions or just float around and learn to use your controls. As long as you don’t get motion sickness, take off the stabilizers. With the stabilizers on it is easy to navigate. Basically you turn on a jet you move stop jetting you stop. Turn off the stabilizers and you continue to float along. To stop you will need to reverse the thrust. It is way to easy to over correct and completely miss your target. This makes it a really challenging game. I would like to be able to begat down my thrust control. The trick is small corrections",This was one of the most amazing things I have experienced. I was a child of the 60s saw the moon landing in 1969. I couldn't stop crying this was so profound for me a truly exceptional experience for me . Absolutely fabulous x,"I really like that you can position yourelf over any country and set the time of day and orbit right over. Very fun to look at areas of the country that you have lived. The night time view really makes this possible because you can see large towns lit up. I could even see Greeley, Colorado. The only thing I'd like to see added is a button that would align you with the earth's horizon. Moving around in space can create motion sickness. I would also like an option for slower locomotion so it's very smooth.","For example, I know the suit while space walking is correct, I wish my feet didn’t bounce into everything, I also wish that there was a way to boost from the way your hand is pointing Edit: So what I don’t understand is that if you are gripping why would you also be boosting? Maybe I just need to play seated"
