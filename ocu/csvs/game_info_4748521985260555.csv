Chapel,"This stone chapel, a reconstruction of an ancient Byzantine church in ancient Cappadocia, was built on the Lanier Theological Library grounds. Based on photos of church ruins taken by Gertrude Bell in 1909 that are now stored at Newcastle University, as well as a later analysis published at Harvard, it is a testimony to church history as well as Christian and Jewish scriptures. This model brings the beauty and majesty of the chapel to the user in an incredible immersive application. With access to faithful reproduction of physical elements and on-demand commentary and translations, the user experiences the modern structure, the ancient ruins on which it is based, and the incredible interior artwork, in a way that only Virtual Reality can provide.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Art/Creativity, Educational",English,2.591,NetEdge,Net Edge VR,https://www.netedgevr.com/,"Sep 19, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4748521985260555/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4748521985260555&r=1, https://www.netedgevr.com/privacy-policy",1.81 GB,"I'm so glad to have run across this app. I like a good game as much as the next person, but love solid experiences like this. In some ways this is even better and useful than the real thing, with the added bonus of the remains of the original building. Really solid application.","I remember visiting the Lanier Byzantine Chapel in-person for a lecture and this is an excellent recreation of it. Not only do I feel like i'm there, I now have an opportunity to learn and appreciate more about the Chapel than I would have had time to in-person thanks to this app. I highly recommend this experience!",Visuals and idea is amazing! Thank you so much for creating this beautiful experience!,"Really wonderful app. I was delighted to see you can actually ""play"" on the upright piano (I'm a pianist). As a suggestion, it would be great to have free locomotion in addition to teleport."
