I bought my quest2 specifically to see if I could improve my real-life tennis in VR. I have been playing tennis for a year. 8 months in VR. I have tried most of the tennis simulators available. This one is my favourite. A couple of the other tennis apps had me hooked for a while as each one does something well and a couple of them do things extremely well but I found I would have to modify my shots a lot when I went to the courts. Since Iâ€™ve settled on Tennis eSports my real-world game has improved the most. The ball acts the most ball-like and my VR skills mostly match how I actually play (better, but still a bit rubbish). The match experience against both AI opponents and other players has been great for becoming a better strategist as well as learning to keep my cool ðŸ˜Ž while competing, they are also heaps of fun and a pretty good workout. The Arcade mode I find challenging and great for zenâ€™ing out and getting in the zone, or if you are a tennis geek like me, working on stroke production and grip changes. If you already know how to play tennis or youâ€™re a gamer and like something you have to put a bit of effort into to get good, then different challenges, leaderboards and gameplay will have you addicted in no time. Mirror play (where you hit against yourself) has taught me the most. Being able to understand spin by hitting every kind of spin shot and racket angle imaginable to myself and then having to return that ball has been game-changing for my real-world game. There are a few things that could be improved. Practice mode feels a bit limited. Running feels awkward but works well enough not to distract too much from gameplay, and maybe I just need more practice at becoming a gamer and running with my thumb. The physics, in my opinion, are not quite perfect â€¦ yet. One of the best parts of this app is that the developers are continually improving the game by engaging with the Discord community of players and have made great improvements since the app lab days, which has led tennis eSports to being the most tennis-like experience out there at the moment. The potential this App has is exciting.","I've been playing this game for quite sometime now and I'm not gonna lie, it's the best tennis online game out there without any doubt at all. It's so real and I love the environment as well. From playing tennis, to meeting new players around the world and winning prize money. This game has everything. Big thanks to the whole team for bringing this game to the people ! Onwards and upwards ðŸ™Œ","Highly recommend this App. The physics are realistic, and every time the App gets better. Cant wait to compete in virtual sports and I love playing the AI The community on discord is cool and the developers are super responsive - also get to win prizes and cash every week","I donâ€™t normally give games reviews but this game is sooo fun! Second app in my quest pro library so far! I bought the HelloReal tennis racket handle to play as well. Only using the quest controller by itself is doable but awkward. I really suggest buying the tennis handle accessory if you can. The training sessions and arcade mode are the most fun. It would be nice though if the training sessions could be customized so you can practice specific shots repeatedly. Iâ€™ve only been on a real tennis court twice in my life so I donâ€™t know how accurate the game is compared to real life but it sure does feel believable. Topspins, slices, down the line forehandsâ€¦being able to land balls on target all feel satisfying. Returning a fast ball from the baseline takes effort which I like because it really adds to the immersion. Mirror play mode is my least favorite of the modes. It doesnâ€™t feel like you have enough time to ready your next swing or recognize where the ball is coming from. The arcade mode is really fun and I think its a better training tool than the programmed training sessions. Only wish that the variety of the shots would be randomized each round. Long story short, great app and experience. Would recommend buying if you like to be active and enjoy sports.","This game have a good graphic and the NPC have a nice motion on the court. But there is a mistake about game situations, the realism of the impact of the ball on the racket during service, reception, forehands and backhands. the effects of the ball at the impact of the racket are not realistic or almost non-existent. Finally there is still a lot of work to do but the interest in this game is still a great project."
