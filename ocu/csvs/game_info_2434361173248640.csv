The sad part is once you learn how to play the game ends. There is a big to be continued over the rest of the map. From what I have seen on line there are no plans to finish it. As much as I love it I wouldn't waste money on it.,"The game has content like a demo. Just when you get started it ends. There is a sign ""Coming soon"" but it is not true. It is just a showcase of what a great game could it be in the price of an actual game. Sorry, but not worth it. In that money you can get huge flying sim like Warplanes WWI - you can't get wrong with that one, the amout of content is mindblowing - that is what Endspace should be!",I’m a big fan of spaceship shooter games. This is one I’m actually quite fond of. The biggest downside is it’s very short and there is a Coming soon on the map. It’s been several years and in that time Nintendo made an announcement of Metroid Prime 4. And we can’t even get a finished spaceship shooter game.,"Got it on sale. Would definitely recommend you wait for a similar buying opportunity since the game is too short and bare bones. I got it hoping for a knock-off Star Wars space fighter game, and was not disappointed! The game play is fun. The gaze-tracking targeting mechanic is exactly what I wanted. I found the missions to be fairly straight forward. A couple of them took a few tries. But there were all enjoyable. Like other reviews, I just wish there were more of them. With no news in like 4 months now, it does t seem like anything new is on the way. On the off chance that an update is coming, it could also use more weapons, ships, energy redirection tools (shields, engine, and weapons all pull energy), wingmen interactions, etc.","is cute. dynamic shadows make it precious. the graphics are good, the general effect is also. The pilot in the cockpit is done well. it seems a little strange though to see the left hand on a hunting throttle and then instead the left hand is used to move the machine guns, you should redesign the left hand which holds another stick for the machine guns, while on the right stick put a couple of buttons that are used to push and slow down with related hand animations, in this way the sensation will be more natural and immersive. you should also make a minimal glass effect of the cockpit, because this way it really looks like an open cockpit without any protective glass, I know it needs more computing power, but I think now with the system updates on the Quest 2 that made it more performant, you should make it. I also understand that the game hasn't received updates for two years, I still don't know if I keep it or return it but I strongly advise you to do something about the game, many are asking you, listen to us."
