Should also let you choose your conversation options with the characters or automatically do it for you. I think the time meter is a bad idea well least in my option. Why do the characters get annoyed when you take too long to respond or give the wrong answer? If you read this devs please take note from Mondly ( practice languages in vr) app which is also available for the quest. Also if possible can locomotion or teleportation be added to move or explore the nice environments as well? that will be great. It has potential to be a great language learning app, but still needs improvement more content and better experiences."
