Fire Extinguisher VR,"Welcome to Fire Extinguisher VR, an immersive fire extinguisher training experience. Users are shown a training presentation that includes classes of fires, types of fire extinguishers and the correct usage. After an interactive quiz to assess their knowledge, users are immersed in a simulation where they need to put their expertise to the test and extinguish a fire under pressure. We’ve developed Fire Extinguisher VR to simulate the exact steps you would need to take in real life to use a fire extinguisher safely. Featuring sounds, timed responses and following the same process you’d need to take in real-life, Fire XR is more cost-effective and realistic than the majority of fire extinguisher training on offer. Please get in touch with us on our website for large-scale commercial use. Our commercial version includes digital certification, additional scenarios and training reminders.",3+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Educational,English,0.81,n-Coders,n-Coders,https://www.n-coders.co.uk/,"Dec 1, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4761727627191250/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4761727627191250&r=1, https://robotknight.co.uk/privacy-policy-cookies/",175.3 MB,"App really helps teach the basics of Fire Safety!
