I really enjoyed this puzzle game. Not only the tube puzzles, but also everything around it. The story, the mini-games, the factory - all very well done. 60 levels, 20 levels per floor, and each floor has different focuses/mechanics. A beautifully designed world, and I also appreciate the attention to detail. There is so much to discover! They could have just made the puzzles, but there was so much done around it... It reminded me a bit of ""Rainbow Reactor: Fusion"", where you not only had to do the puzzles, but you had rooms to walk around, complete small tasks, or play mini-games. You can tell that a lot of brainpower went into this game, and the puzzles are clever and varied. The playtime is also quite long. Highly recommended for puzzle enthusiasts.","So love game so far, so cute and just buy it but reason for 4 stars only, I'm stuck on hamster hangout 6 where the lab is introduced I can see it's u needing to make another tube missing for puzzle but plzzz tell me what to do w the remote thingy w 3 dots I can not b only one who has stuck here just like the late for work shooting hamster mini game gav a tutorial and common sense u could get that game but remote thingy needs tutorial a sign explaining I'll take whatever I can get I hav done everything I can think of and nothingüò¨üòíüòÜ probably very easy but definitely needs added plzzzz help asap can't wait to c what's next.","A fun and cute puzzle game. The first nine levels is a good warm-up to get into the game. On level ten I got stuck thinking there must be a tube missing, or well hidden. But most likely l have a lack of brainpower. I'm going to recharge and then get back into the game to show the boss who's the boss. Dressing up your hamster is a nice touch, and adds to replayability. One very minor thing I found a bit ""irritating"" is having to press A for hamsters to continue talking. I would like a setting that makes them keep talking until finished, or waiting for me to reply. Tube be or not tube be, that is the question.","Tried the demo and immediately wanted the full game. Novel puzzles mixed with mini-games to keep it fresh, absolutely gorgeous (and cute) animation and the humor is fabulous. Haven't enjoyed a game THIS much in a while. The hamsters are surprisingly realistic! Had to stop myself playing so I don't use it all up. And being able to choose a hamster and what its wearing are really fun touches. Highly, HIGHLY recommend. This plays like a completed game, even though some sections are clearly still under construction. Since it's still in development, things I'd love to see: 1. Ability to turn off smooth locomotion. Even with the sensitivity down, it's still easy to accidentally move. 2. Picking up dropped items doesn't always work, but I love LOVE the feature that they just go back to the board. 3. I don't know how big an ask this is, but I want to pet the hamsters. If I think of more as I progress I'll add them, but as it stands, this game is fantastic. Can't wait to see the rest of it. I don't like to pay for unofficial games but this one is well, well worth it.",Tube Be Continued is a cute little puzzle game that has you saving the job of one head hamster boss! The game has you solving a ton of puzzles through the Tube Industries. You must find parts of the tubes around the factory and connect them in the right order to get each hamster to their food bowl. The game is unique and I love the characters! You can customize the hamsters and there are several mini games and floors to keep you coming back for more! If you like puzzle games this is a game almost anyone can play! Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f22-5xZYfWM
