Gameplay is pretty good for ppl who suffer from VR motion sickness, bc you can just stand in one place and attack the oncoming bouncy balls. You do have to spin around 360 degrees though, so be aware of that. I like that it's so outside the box (mixing bouncy balls with knights), and I think adding some more of that creativity could really enhance the game. (Maybe some clever attack moves/weapons or unique characters or some way to interact with the world other than fighting, like gaining allies or collecting tokens.) The game was enjoyable for a short time, but I don't see myself choosing it over other games often, or spending too much more time in it, so that's why the 2 stars.","First, thank you developers of this simple fun game, I enjoy it. Allow to have different swords , use of bow and arrow is possible. I recommend this fun game for everyone to play. The environment are beautiful and colorful. If possible to allow the player to pick the level of wave to play with, so it doesn't always start from the 1st level over again. Thank you",I realy liek thies game I got a woreld reacored
