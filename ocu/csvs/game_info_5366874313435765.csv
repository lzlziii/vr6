I know that’s a hard title to hold and give to a game but let me tell you, as someone who has had access to this for roughly 6 months now, this game is far different then anything I’ve ever played. I have over 300 hours and just can’t seem to stop playing. And I don’t know if that’s because I’m good at it or if it’s fun, but I think a combination of both. The combat is intuitive and fun but with a huge skill gap. I like to think of it as nock meets echo due to the movement and disk play. This is definitely worth the $15 and I would highly recommend picking this up. And, I can tell you for a fact they have lots planned so join the discord (https://discord.com/stackvr) to see all upcoming updates!",Love this game. So much fun and strategy to kill or be killed. Like how the Devs keep updating this game. It’s turning into one of my favorites over the usual War and Zombie games. Keep it up devs. Just need to get more people to play. Be great if they could mix this game and Echo Arena together,Just buy it you can say I’m biased because I got it for free when it was in beta. BUT THIS GAME IS SO COOL the movement is a masterpiece and so is the disc! I love how you can control the disc with ur hand! ALSO THIS IS IMPORTANT CHECK OUT JOY WAYS OTHER GAMES! I can’t stop playing this game! Also 1 last thing if you try out this game and love it like me! Check out stride I play that game basically daily.,"This game when I first got it all the way in early February 2023 was amazing it still is to this day and although there is a lot of bugs right now, it still has the same vision as always has. That vision is a great fun, apocalyptic environment full of nice and caring people here to help you along this deserted wasteland. This game will go on to achieve great things and that's why I rate this title 5 out of 5 stars. The worst part of stack is it's high skill cap, cause as it stands there is a huge gap between the best and the average player","Buy and face me. At the price point this game will deliver tons of hours. Biggest problem you will have is me being so awesome at the game. This game is really good once you get the mechanics. Once you get the skills down it is addictive fun. Bank shots and the use of the force on disc is amazing. Fast paced game building a population fast. Once your good the bulk of you kills will be from people who forget you can kill them from behind with the disk return :) Cant wait for a ranking system. Visuals -are good Game -is fairly polished Matchmaking- not the worst, but could be a little better. Longest wait Ive had was 3 minutes at 2 am, but there is a game lobby to play in Communication- alot of people should push to talk, as new players all breathing heavily to a hysterical point as they frantically try to figure out how to play. Controls- Simple as simple can be. GRIP RELEASE TO THROW no brainer Skillcap- more people should take time (took me all of five minutes playing around) to figure out the mechanics on rebounds, force use and how slingshot drops your shield. Most people recall disc to early leaving selfs exposed. 30 minutes to intermediate, 2 hours and you will want a comp."
