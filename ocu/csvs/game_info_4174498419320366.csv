The music is great, the scenery is great. That girl enemy in the first set of scenes is HOT!!! Why I had to take away a star? I HATE! HATE! and I mean HATE that Beat Saber bulls*** with the arrows! You have a jab, a cross, and uppercut, a hook and a hammerfist. That should be enough. Why do I have to throw an upper with a hammer simultaneously like I am splitting cubes in Beat Saber, which is a game I HATE! Other than that, great job!","I enjoy this game, it's a good workout. I like the environments and the different enemies you fight against. The music is also good. I compare this game to powerbeats, but with more gaming elements. Don't buy it if you don't want a fitness game, because you will move and sweat (and burn calories).",I got this game by mistake And I have to say best game I have on my headset look 4wad to more games from these developers
