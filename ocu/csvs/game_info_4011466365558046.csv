It really does every time you update it. I open it straight away. Of course the biggest problem for me. I have yet to see get fixed but maybe it's just a me thing to the lovely developers working so hard. My name is Kenneth and if I can make one suggestion. I don't like that on the quest 2 (maybe not on PC. I'm unsure} the game gives you no sound on the drums. No feedback on the drums whatsoever unless you hit each drum at the exact time during a song. There's no judgment or prayer for judgments on a late hit or an early one. Therefore, when you're getting into it and trying to while out on the drums, there's no sense of varying impact when you're trying to smash the drum. With zero feedback during those times, it does seem as well an aiding factor to how complicated it feels and hard. Overall, it seems to be to truly set the drums position right where you need it. The only time I've played and made it through a song since I've had the game well with any success on that song. Took me a whole battery usage in my headset to set the drums up. Keep in mind I have been blinding my left eye from birth but do have developed debt perception to a significant enough degree that being a proud owner of every drum and game that has come out for the metaquest 2. I'll brush my shoulder off and say that for the ones well made I'd beat that crud up! Lol. Devs I really love this game. And I'm not sure if my feedback will really do you need justice or not? But if there's anything you can do about that for me, I'm totally down to sing your praises on all the socials, the medias, the book, face, the tweeters, and so on","The best drumming game on the market. Played it from when it was on Sidequest a few years ago. It says 41 songs but I can’t find them all, not sure why?",it’s ok but there are so many better options. just meh over all.,GrooVR might just be what the Virtual Reality needs in the music space. This game is very similar to Beat Saber and has all the fixings of Guitar Hero. I had a great time with this game and so glad I got to play it! I might just actually learn how to play the drums! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIdlBzqtwaM
