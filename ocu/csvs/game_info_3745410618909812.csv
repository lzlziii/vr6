Iâ€™ve had it since the beginning when it was Mafia Bowling. The developer has made A LOT of improvements, and continues to do so. He is very responsive in correcting any problems and will do anything he can to make his customers happy. I really appreciate his dedication, time, and attention. The environments are fun and have several nice touches, surprises, and extras so donâ€™t forget to take a look around!",Had this game since thw first development stages and have seen the game develope. I find it really fun and means I can play without leaving the house. It's bright and easy to use. Any issues found are reported and te developer quickly works to fix issues. Fab little game and brilliant price. Can't really complain :) ðŸ˜€,Good game.,"Ok, lets start with the name of the player. I have to choose one? I have to play online? Only a look to the help page is answering my question. Ok, let's have a try. Start. Yes, name again... Start... There is an entrance room. It seems i have to go a lot of steps to the marked area... OUTSIDE of the guardian area!? No way to get there by teleport, analog sticks or buttons? - Really not?!? I tried but nothing happened. Ok, i have 3 meters in my real room to go. But i realized, i have to go about the double distance in VR. I had to reset the orientation, to go back in real, further to the target area. Got it! 'Oh, how unconfortable...' - in truth, I had used a different expression. Ok, there is the alley. Wrong side in my real room... Just again and again, resetting the view orientation. Checking again, where i am in the room, where is real space for the walk to the alley (Exactly that, what i already did, before i started the app!!!) Ok. Just do it now... Swing the ball to the back, to the front, and...: It's flying. - - - It is STILL... FLYING!!! Â°Â° With big eyes i started some more attemps. I gave it a try, to get used by it. -- NO - THANKS! -- Nice graphics and music - here is your star. But no gaming experience is possible. Continue to work on it! In my opinion, it is not even on alpha niveau...","The game looks nice but has issues. While trying to bowl the ball it often falls to the floor or flies high up into the air which makes it feel like there is no weight to it. When I was bowling and missing the pins it wouldn't count as a turn,so i could have lots of attempts rather than 2 bowls(annoying when other player had 15 attempts before it counted as his turn finished). The game got stuck after the score was displayed at the end of the game,could walk around but there didn't seem anything we could do to go onto another game or try pool. Tried all buttons but couldn't progress from this screen although could walk around. Maybe something we were missing but we had to quit app."
