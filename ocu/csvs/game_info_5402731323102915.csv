Boule Petanque,"BOULE PETANQUE is a VR sports game that makes you play boules or p√©tanque or boccia. Petanque is a target sport that is played with steel boules and a jack (target ball). Get the boules as close as you can to the jack to score points. When you get to 13 points, you win. No matter what the weather is like, the sun always shines on the square in the game. In the relaxed atmosphere of a square that could be like this in the south of France, you can throw the jack and the balls. In single player mode you learn how to do it, in multi-player mode (1 vs. 1, 2 vs. 2, 3 vs. 3) you can compete against other players. These can be friends or random players all over the world. Special is certainly the sound of the game: the cicadas buzz, the bullets bang and immediately you are in another world.

Activating the music player seems a little shaky and one thing badly missing is 1v1 Multiplayer or a possibility in general to compete against other ""human"" players without being in a VR bubble. Otherwise - great.",This game is sooo good to kill time with friends. Fun and relaxing too!,"It‚Äòs the best petanque simulation (I know 2), I ever played. As I am a petanque coach, first I was frustrated not to win. Then I started with the easiest level - and won. Then I tried the second level - and won again. On level 3 I am still working on my first victory.üôÅ - I missed some noises, too. - it‚Äòs hard to throw the jack. It is too ‚Äûlight‚Äú/quick! - quite often I lost a ball, which fell down - why? How could I play with others? This I couldn‚Äôt manage up to now. Keep on improving! Even it‚Äòs great! Karl (Boulecoach)","UPDATE: I deleted the old review because everything I complained about was FIXED! I increased the stars to 4 stars! The tutorial is excellent to help you learn how to play if you never have played Bocce Ball before. They added difficulty levels as well as multiplayer rounds. Now you can play against the Robot, play 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, or 3 vs 3. This is a really fun, relaxing and challenging game! EXCELLENT! I'd still like to see more action/people in the background as you play. Possibly old men sitting at a table playing checkers, children playing, or people watching you play who then clap when the game is done and/or when you win a round. This game is just ready for the Merta store!","Fun game, but after a recent update some of the sound effects, like rusty shooting out his balls, have been removed...why?"
