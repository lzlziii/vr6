Rhythm 'n Bullets,"An arcade SHMUP where the music is part of the action. Travel across the virtual zone and defend the core by guiding a pair of starfighters through the shoot 'em up action of Rhythm 'n Bullets. Enemies fly in from all sides, diving towards the core in time with the soundtrack. Time your shots to the beat for maximum effect, and grab awesome power-ups to clear the stage. Keep the core safe from danger in the multi-level campaign, and then try to top the leaderboards in endless mode, where the enemies never stop! Take a break with our relax mode where you can practice your shooting and experience remixes of the games score! Features four themes: Tech City, Japanese Garden, Galaxy Zone, and Holiday Forest! Fifth theme coming soon!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Shooter","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Taiwan), Japanese, Korean","1.21

Rhythm won't help you at all, just your aim and your ability to keep switching the colors. Too simple for the price. Not worth the money or your time.","The gameplay is very reminiscent of the arcade classic space invaders, with the visual trip the synthwave aesthetic provides on top. Different backgrounds can be unlocked but the songs meant to accompany the experience don't seem to vary, if change at all. Make no mistake though, this is NOT a rhythm game and if you're buying this with those expectations, you're setting yourself for disappointment. Now, as a VR shooter-esque game, it can be enjoyable for a casual afternoon of gaming if you're seeking to relax and play something more simplistic whilst remaining active, however, be wary, it takes a while until you get there. The controls felt very counter-intuitive and the introductory tutorial was even more confusing as a whole, having only learned how to play the game properly through self discovery and button smashing. Once you get the hang of it, it can be a fun and satisfying experience (aside from the weird noise the shields make, that in longer and more challenging sessions, can become bothersome). The ships replacing your controllers as if they were your hands are a creative idea, but it didn't translate well in size and adjustability, to me personally, though it doesn't affect gameplay. It has multiple game modes, from campaign (with a beginning and an end) to endless mode (pretty self explanatory). The latter was somewhat confusing however, considering the objects meant to be destroyed weren't randomly spawned, making this more of a creative mode where you select everything yourself than anything else. Overall, in the current state that it is, I can't recommend this game *at this price*. It lacks too much on content to be worth your money, so I'd aim to get it on promotions, should it drop closer to 5â‚¬, at least until there's further development and a substantial increase on customization, as well as a revamp of the tutorial.","This game is a blast! At first I thought the game would be simple and wouldn't hold my interest for long. I was WRONG. The developers were very creative in finding ways to keep the gameplay fresh. This game is simple to learn, but challenging to master. I really enjoyed having to bounce between colors on my ships and deploying shields at just the right time, it reminded me of learning to juggle. The soundtrack is also very engaging - shooting with the beat boosts your firepower and really gets you moving. I felt completely immersed in the game and I can't wait to have my friends try it.","i think this game is amazing and i definitely recommend others to buy this wonderful game, and i also have to add, the owner of this game was super nice and super cool, and everyone should definitely leave a nice review in my opinion but always be sure to leave an honest review.","Great game, love how you have to switch colors on ships guns, makes some interesting game play. Really loving all the AppLab stuff, keep em coming. Oh ya the sound track is awesome, like how you get rewarded for keeping with the beat. A lot going on, in a Retro super style back grounds."
