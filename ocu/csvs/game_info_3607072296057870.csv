One of many I play at least once a day. The only thing I miss is the laughing hunting dog that taunts you when you miss.ðŸ¤£,Husband and I both enjoy this game! Fun and exciting! Would love to see and add on of amount of ammo you have left.,"I remember playing this game in an arcade back in the '80s & '90s when it was called ""Duck Hunter"" I'm not a hunter in real life, but I enjoyed playing this game. Shooting the ducks, crows, rabbits, wolves & gators makes it a great game. It changes from day to night back to the day and repeats several times giving you a different atmosphere to play in. I'd like to see more levels with more difficulty levels and new challenges. Add things like geese, deer, and moose to the game. You need to change up the patterns more. Maybe have the gators & wolves attack from different locations instead of the exact same each time. WHY ISN'T THIS GAME BEING SOLD IN THE OCULUS STORE ALREADY?","Player for 10 min, there is no option to move, you just hold your pistol and shoot which obviously one can't do for more than 5-10 min. Its a great port but game itself is very limited. I would like to get refund if that's possible. Played for not more than 7-8 min",I don't play this game for long periods of time but it's fun to play for a bit. It's a cool shooter game.
