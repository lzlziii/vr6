I stopped trying to use hand tracking cause of many reasons but mainly because arms getting tired and grabbing puzzle pieces while not trying to when turning the knobs. It also makes jumping way easier but it doesn't even need hand tracking to be an amazing game! I wish there were a little more instructions like saying it is only part of the flute when you get it. I tried to play that thing multiple times before I watched a video saying you don't get it until half way through the game. It made the game even more amazing when I got it though! I feel like link playing the ocarina! I also wish there were some element of fighting but aside from that I am in love and wish I had given it another chance earlier,"Very frustrating. I played through 2/3 of it, then it randomly crashed, and erased the saved game. I had to start back at the beginning. Then I decided to give it a second chance. I actually played through 99% of it. I placed the special puzzle piece in tower, solving all 4 colors at once. It started to play the animation in the center of the room, and crashed again. This time, it let me resume back in the tower. But the special puzzle piece had disappeared. It was no longer placed there. It was not in my inventory. And when I went back to where I found it, it was no longer there. So I can get beyond that point, unless I start over at the beginning. I‚Äôm not replaying this game a third time from the start, just to see the ending. In addition, the terrible hand tracking is a real challenge. To get an item in inventory, you must touch it with your finger tip. But don‚Äôt let your finger actually go into it, or it will ignore you. You have to hover your exact finger tip on the item for a few seconds to select it. And when climbing a ladder, never turn your palms away from you, like you would on a real ladder. Instead, always turn your palms toward each other. And the same with reins. It would also help if the developers could run spell check. For some strange reason, all through the game, ‚Äúwhittle‚Äù is spelled as ‚Äúwiddle‚Äù, and there are grammar and punctuation errors. I like the music in the game. And some of the music puzzles are genuinely nice. And much of the design is very creative. But it is ruined by crashes erasing your saved game. I‚Äôm playing this on a Quest Pro, and other apps are fine, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a hardware problem.","While the puzzles in Eolia can be challenging at times, they are well designed and satisfying to solve. The game's pacing is on point, providing a smooth balance between exploration, puzzle-solving, and narrative progression. At times, it is difficult to find solutions throughout the game, a good game for VR veterans. One of the best hand tracking games out there.","A few days ago I saw the announcement of a major update to this game on the Meta channel and decided to give it a try. And what a great idea it was! Lol I've been playing it for the last two days and it‚Äôs one of the best story based experiences I've tried.üëç Absolutely great gameplay with unique elements, beautiful environments and impressive scenes scale!üî•","Elioa sounds like a great game but there are some bugs.The game has a part where there are these things called dust devils and that part of the game is impossible to win. You ride these things (that I forgot the name of) and to slow them down you pull back and the game decides to glitch your position back and it will slow you down or stop you, the allowing the dust devils to get you. Elioa has a great concept to it but the glitches make the game impossible to win but if the developer or developers fixed that, it would make the game more playable"
