I wish everyone who has doubts on the QuestPro could try this. This is a showcase game in my opinion for the first Pro. Hiding the fish around the house and then handing off the headset for a sort of scavenger hunt is a great use for this as well. Very immersive game with the hand and finger tracking as well.,"Another lovely demonstration for a super immersive experience. Swimming and feeding sharks at home. I like taking and placing octupus with hands. And it's only the beginning, waiting for more and more. Great app.",I enjoy being able to interact with all of the animals.,Awesome execution and great potential!,I love the use of the passthrough here. Animals of all sizes really offer a great visual experience. I highly recommend it!!!
