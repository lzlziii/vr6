Nock: Bow + Arrow Soccer,"Nock is bow and arrow soccer. Skate and fly around a pitch while using a bow and arrow to blast the ball into the other team‚Äôs goal. Compete in multiplayer ranked matches, or play casual custom games with your friends! Like a real sport, Nock is easy to learn but difficult to master. Block arrows let you create obstacles and you can even use your body to make a goal or save. A fast-moving ball can knock you out. Skill-based matchmaking keeps every game extremely close and competitive. Casual modes let you challenge yourself against bots or play with friends in custom matches. Nock includes voice chat with individual muting options so you can communicate with teammates easily.",3+,Multiplayer,"Standing, Sitting, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Shooting, Sports","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Spain)",1.9.2,Normal,Normal,https://nock.game/,"Mar 10, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5157404804284116/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5157404804284116&r=1, https://normcore.io/legal/privacypolicy",Terms of Service,2.81 GB,"Ive played nock for a while now, and I always find the motivation to come back and play the next day, the game is fun and addicting, it also has a very loving community, with some of nicest players and some of the coolest managers I‚Äôve seen out of any other game (talking about you towellieü´∂üèΩ) I hope the game keeps growing so I can keep coming back each day and playing with the best community ever. I would 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for a new entertaining game.","nock is a vr GEM! this game is so much fun and basically everyone I met on this game has been so nice with simple ‚Äúggs‚Äù or ‚Äúnice shot‚Äù one of the downsides of this game is its player population, it‚Äôs unfortunately low. As of 10/31/2022 the max players in queue was about 5 players, which is quite sad to see, but eventually you get into a match. it does take practice to actually get GOOD at the game, just play some rounds and youll get there. its definitely worth the price and i HIGHLY recommend you give it a shot. and happily takes its place on my top 5 vr games. (oh also the battle pass WAS completely free!! which sucks now but W game) 10/10 amazing game","I rate it 5 stars because the design and gameplay are very good, but be prepared to learn and be humbled by your opponents. This game has a steep learning curve and a mountainous skill ceiling, much like rocket league and sort of like Echo VR. Speaking of Echo VR, this is a great replacement especially if you played Echo VR alone (solo queue), however if you were very into the social lobbies and such, Nock is very much only social if you party up with one or two of your pals, or just talk during the match, in this way it's much more like rocket league. I picked up Nock and felt right at home due to previous experiences in Echo Arena (3500 games), and Rocket League (1800 hours), however like rocket league, this game has a massive skill ceiling that WILL humble you, you will LOSE, but what's important is that you learn and try next time! As far as bad things or stuff the game could improve on, I wish there was some more information about the ranked system, also sometimes the game stutters a little, but I only found this to be an issue in 3v3 (still in beta) and very packed 2v2 matches (blocks and arrows everywhere). Pick up this game and enjoy missing most of your shots (in a good way). Seriously get this game.",I absolutely love Nock! It‚Äôs just like Roket Leauge but in VR! This game is EASILY my new favorite game because i stayed up till midnight playing it. (Also special thanks to LSToast for gifting me this game)! Integrity.,"I want to enjoy this game, but I just can't. The community is incredibly toxic with every server I join, being a kid telling me how bad I am at the game. The game is incredibly laggy. The ball will just teleport around the map half the time because of this. Other than all this, the game is fun when it works, and you get in a good server, but it's very rare for that to be the case half the time."
