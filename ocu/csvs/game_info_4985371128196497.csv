Laughed alot watching myself fumbling trying to keep up with the orders, dropping food, plates, throwing completed orders on the belt. Had a ball... good game though I didn't get very far in the game. I RECOMMEND it to anyone who's been there and just needs a laugh!","I cannot pick up items, cut, or do anything with my controllers. I can only open & close certain doors. Will this be fixed soon? If not, I will need a full refund. UPDATE: The controllers work great once I opened the store. Thank you very much. It's a fun game :)"
