Visionarium,"The visionary journey continues! Visionarium is a follow up VR experience by multimedia artist and solo indie developer Sander Bos Now available for quest. This audio driven journey features an archetypal mystical experience, inviting the player to surrender to the darkness as a way to break through and enter visionary states. Most of the artwork is painted in Tiltbrush and other VR creation tools, trying to make the most out of VR as a new artform. Please note that this release of Visionarium is developed for quest 2 and is a different experience then its previous release for other headsets.

I'd definetly reccommend playing this while laying on a couch or bed as it feels way more immersive. It's super cool to float through these magical and trippy environments and just take it all in. I really enjoyed playing it while listening to audiobooks and podcasts. It's worth buying if it's what you're looking for, but don't expect some crazy gameplay.",You guys did a great job with this version I loved it!!!...I also have your 3 games on Steam for my Vive....I wish I could combine your stuff with TRIPP. That would be absolute heaven.....keep up the great work....your style is spot on in my world. :),"This game is best described for myself as a cross between a Star Trek: TMP (the first movie) V'GER movie experience in VR, and a steroid-based representation of an old Steve Ditko drawn Dr. Strange comic book, with a touch of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The default game mode takes you on an 'on-rails' experience to where you basically sit/stand and look around at the trippy visuals with soothing background music. Turning in this game is limited to snap turning only, which is disappointing (although physical turning can compensate for it). There is an alternate mode (FreeFly) to where you get off the rails, and can move around at your own pace and any available vantage point, but with 2 disappointing side effects: (i) All music stops (which is a huge immersion breaker) and (ii) any directional control is limited to where you are looking (I would have preferred joystick control for up/down/forward/back for a greater sense of free flight). I did have one occurrence to where choosing FreeFly resulted in my completely losing all camera control, and put into an almost virtual tailspin (which was slightly nauseating, but pretty cool in its own way). Turning FreeFly on and off again corrected this issue. The visuals, in my opinion, don't match the Steam VR version (on which this game is based, and which I have played in the past) in terms of sharpness specifically, but over time I adjusted to that difference, and found the graphics enjoyable, but don't really know how they compare based on other Quest offerings. Under Options, you have a choice of Visual Display with options of Linear, Decibel and SQRT (square root). I wish I knew what those choices meant, and how they impact the experience. You also have a microphone option which apparently allows you to hear your voice in the game; I guess that's a way to pipe in other music during FreeFly, although I would have much preferred an option to include my own music.",I’m into VR for the visual and audio experiences and I’m not much of a gamer so this type of app appeals to me. I’m pretty sensitive to motion sickness and I was able to get through the whole journey with no problem at all. I enjoyed the flow and transitions throughout and the music was very pleasant. I found it to be exhilarating and awe inspiring and the interactive part was pretty cool. this is another VR experience that will go into my library and I look forward to exploring it many times over. I think it’s well worth the small investment.,The experience of this app is amazing. It's so detailed and well made. It's like you're in your own world and it's nice that you can sit down and enjoy the experience. There are a lot of colours and the music is well chosen.
