There are currently 4 environments but I really hope the Developers will give us more environments in future updates. My favorites are the Frozen and the Nordic Themed ones. It's the usual Match 3 mechanics but with a twist. It's relaxing for me. My only complaint is that when you exit the game and return to play, you must start over from the beginning instead of being able to start from where you finished. For me, this is a refreshing change from the usual shooter games we are always seeing launched. And, you can readily see that the Developers of this game really thought about what they were creating as you play through the levels in the 4 Environments. Please give us more levels.",But I wanted to support dev. I just hope they add more environments and levels because it’s a fantastic game but too little content for the asking price imo. Right now it’s an under $10 title for me but I’ll keep it hoping they add more. Sound effects are wonderful and don’t get annoying despite being repetitive,I lost track of time playing this. Easy to learn and hard to master. Win conditions are time based and specifically different on each level. That alone keeps my attention. 05/21/2022 60 min play time,"I love this game! It's beautiful, relaxing, cute and colorful. Please keep updating more levels please. That evil stump and the snowman are adorable."
