If not, can you please make it possible?",It's a good game,"It is a cool concept. The only problem is that it seems repetitive and rather bland. I feel like this should be more of an arcade kind of game. By that I mean short levels, lots of action, and fun gameplay. The idea is fine but It needs some polishing and fine tuning.",Need VS. multiplayer mode for more fun gameplay.,"Played on Quest 1: I like this game alot. Its fun. Also like the ""hidden"" references to movies/games of the past. Hint: Try the game cartridges on the old console for some wacky fun to throw"
