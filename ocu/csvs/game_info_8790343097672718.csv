The graphic Is good and the game Is very enjoyble, good story! Still some bugs (I Lost objects too often) and riddles are a Little too Easy. GOOD WORK I Lost the piece of paper under the stairs and the match inside the drawer and a Little House (inside the big One)","Very much enjoying this game. I’m a fan of escape room games and this one is interesting. It’s not super difficult. It’s still a bit buggy, so hopefully that will be worked out. 2 suggestions: a way to either turn the background music/sound down and also allow the pop up text to be stabilized. It’s hard to read when it moves when you turn your head. Otherwise, I’m enjoying this so much!"
