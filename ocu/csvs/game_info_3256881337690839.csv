It is a great baseball game. However it would be nice if there was some sort of seasons mode where it tracked your teams stats. As well as after the season you have a playoffs. Overall a 10/10. The best baseball game you can play on oculus. Definitely recommend,"I love this game so much but some things you could add is a harder team/mode. I put all of the settings in the hardest and still win by 10. Also you could also make more maps/stadiums. Next, a cool thing to add would be bat skins ( to make the bats colorful) Finally, you could add a season mode with playoffs and then a World Series. Here are some suggestions and I know you guys are constantly working on making the game better and I appreciate it. Thank you! Also if you are looking at this review to buy the game this is a great option one of the best sports games in the store!","I know new pitches r coming soon but do u have an exact date i really cant wait and want to know also i have a good suggestion I think you should make 30 teams just like the mlb and players actually matter .like u should make it that each player on a team has certain stats for example pitcher on the la phants has a better curveball than others , first baseman on the sloths has a lot of strength and can hit a lot of homers, shortstop on the robins is very fast , and so on. Make each person on each team have stats for example John smith Speed 78 Power 85 Plate discipline 94 Contact 89 Stealing 72 This will just make the game feel more real and a lot more fun",Maybe like season mode or online season mode. I think this ideas is cool but umpire mode. Or maybe like a umpire jersey. And there should be instructions to get the bats jersey. And maybe in single player mode you get to choose your home stadium.,"The only thing I don’t like about this game is the pitching, if you try to throw fast it either goes way down or way up so you kind of have to lob it. The npc’s bat hit boxes are way to big, because I will throw a good one in the corner of the strike zone the npc swings in the middle and is at least 4 inches away from the ball and winds up hitting a home run. Sometimes I think I’m doing good pitching and then the game gets weird and all of the npc are hitting homers off me EVERY SINGLE PITCH. Other than that it’s a good game to play with friends in multiplayer."
