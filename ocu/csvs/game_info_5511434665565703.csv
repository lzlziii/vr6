One of the bugs that i encountered is that you will be just playing and you arm will phase through you patient and will get stuck. Over all one of my all time favorite games!,"So I downloaded this game a few days ago and it says it has ‚Äúintense gore‚Äù but it- absolutely does not. It‚Äôs not any detailed blood guts and gore and nasty crap it‚Äôs pretty like.. pre-teen to young teen age appropriate ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è That isn‚Äôt a negative connotation, I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to gore a lot of the time. It‚Äôs a fun game, simple controls, challenging. Well spent money Ngl üëç","This is a very fun game and I haven‚Äôt had any problems. Please add more levels and a sandbox mode where you can mess around with all the tools cause I completed the hole game in an hour and would like moor things to do. Lots of people are saying the game is way to hard but I found it really easy. Over all, very fun game","I play and enjoy myself until It comes to picking up objects! It glitches and won‚Äôt move. For example, whenever I pick up the syringe and try to use adrenaline, it refuses to work. It won‚Äôt suck whatever ur trying to pick up. It stays stuck. This game has no excuse for bugs at such an age and price. Please fix!","After playing the game, I can see why there are so many negative reviews, and it's at a 3.4/3.5 rating. This game feels like it is still in Alpha phase. It is so buggy and not polished at all. Between my hand constantly getting stuck on objects, objects getting stuck inside each other, tools randomly stop working, and don't work again afterwards, and the overall hand physics, grabbing things and not being able to get it positioned properly in your hand, I don't see how this game got passed to be in the Meta store. This game still needs alot of work. 100% pass till it gets polished and the bugs get fixed. Don't even get me started on the final level with the machine arm. It's janky as f*ck. Didn't even bother to complete it. I should've listened to the ratings!"
