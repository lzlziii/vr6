Rez Infinite,"One of the most critically-acclaimed games of all time finally comes to Quest in style: Experience 360 degrees of mind-blowing synesthesia as you blast through waves of enemies and giant transforming bosses, with colors and sounds that sync and blend to the beat of Rez‚Äôs legendary techno soundtrack. Check out the fully remastered classic Rez levels Areas 1 through 5, and an all-new free-flying experience in Area X.

I have so much good memories with this game. Played it so much on every platform i had Dreamcast Xbox 360 Psvr 1 And now finally on quest 2 The only issue i have ist that the volume is too quiet in area x mode I hope the devs wil fix this. This game is made to play on max volume üòÅ Hopefully one day they will ad more of the area x stages. Or maybe a rez 2 ü§ó,"If you enjoyed the original Rez, this is beyond amazing and you owe it to yourself to play it. If not, it is still a decent 90's style bullet hell shooter with fantastic sound design!","It looks and sounds awesome and gets that 90s VR vibe and aesthetics. But because you can directly aim now instead of the old analog stick aiming, it becomes a piece of cake. Well worth the experience but it's over in an hour or so... and those with motion sickness beware that it can be wild. Overall, Tetris Effect distills much of Rez mesmerizing audio visual wizardry into a better and more enduring game.","Rez is an overall chill rhythm game, for those who already played it. You arent missing out much when playing this. In addition, things sound a bit off compared to the original and the graphics are very poor not even upgraded. Area X was new, very beautiful and intriguing but it only lasted 15 to 20 mins and it was over. Old games being ported to VR is fine and all but this seems like a lazy port, compared to other titles like RE 4 VR where they at least upgraded the detailing and graphics here and there. If this company can expand on Area X into a full fledge game lasting 8 hours or more at the same price though, I am game to purchase something like that. Other than that, this game port is a rip-off.","It's really an amazing game. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is it needs more levels. Really gives that ""lawnmower man"" feel."
