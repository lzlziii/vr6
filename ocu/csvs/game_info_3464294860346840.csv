The thing I really like about this fitness app, is that it's not subscription based, so I've been able to dump its main competitor from my app library and save myself $200 a year! (now that's got to be good for my bank balance.) I love how many options there are to try, it took me a while to figure it all out, but now I feel like I have way more control over the experience. Love the playlist option, so you don't have to stop every few minutes to choose another song. Love the squatting, ducking, and punch variations, love the little bullets of light and my super cool shields that have me squatting even more (perfect for wearing a weighted vest). This app gets my heart rate up and is on par with a run!","I am loving this game! I can't believe the workouts I am getting and how much I actually look forward to it. Using my own music but not needing to do the choreography myself is AWESOME! I have tried many of the VR fitness apps, but something about this one feels really different in the way I move. I can really engage my core, and I feel my arms and back. It is a great workout.","Just got this Fitness game! Omg itâ€™s epic, itâ€™s literally playing a game combined with fitness! So you have a really good Tutorial to start and please you need to concentrate on it, as once you get into the game play you really need your wits about you, as it also tests your coordination skills and speed! Which is amazing ðŸ˜Ž Great music tracks and scenes to choose from! Once you start playing this game you will be hooked. Itâ€™s another one of those addictive Rhythm based fitness games! Pinching, dodging, slicing and blocking to the beat! Really immersive and you really do get sucked into the game. Gets your heart racing! Really well laid out also! And looks stunning! Highly recommend if your into fitness and rhythm ðŸ’¥ Well done devs great job!!!","You can put your favorite song in it with different levels! Hope can battle with other friends or challenge with some computer enemy character in the future, it would be more fun ~!","Iâ€™ve tried a bunch of different workout apps and while some may be fancier than this one, none give me a better workout. Plus, I am extremely motivated to try and get my name at the top of the lists and/or at least beat my own scores â€” and it has a separate section to compare your scores with your friends. In a lot of ways I would describe this as beat saber with punches - and a WHOLE LOT OF FUN!"
