Home Detective,"Use your own living room to solve the crime! Using passthrough, the crime scene is overlaid onto your play area, leaving you free to explore and find clues. Use the patent-pending Residual Heat Scanner to detect the criminals' recent movements, and then dust for fingerprints or try to find evidence left behind. With your wits, and your trusty sidekick Steve Dobbins' snarky comments, you're sure to get to the bottom of these confusing crimes.",12+,Single User,"Roomscale, Sitting, Standing","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Interactive Story, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish (Spain), Ukrainian",1.0.8,David Addis,David Addis,https://www.davidaddis.com/,"May 10, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6123516891014614/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6123516891014614&r=1, https://www.davidaddis.com/?page_id=61616",936.2 MB,1. I love these new pass through games and I love spy games and this game is pretty neato but 1 thing I have to say is with the newest update I keep on crashing whenever I start the game. I really wanted to buy the other levels but itâ€™s not letting me do that. Hope you can fix that issue soon! 2. Please get rid of the 3D models they are ugly af. I liked it when they were just in my ear not staring at e with their big weird eyes. Game is great just work more on the models!,Developer I try to download case 3 update and it won't let me download he keeps saying sorry you don't have permission to download this I don't know why it's saying that,"Very cool concept but it needs alot more work. first off it needs alot of play area,roughly 10x10. 2nd the items that it spawns tend to be too close to the boundary especially the floor so i had to raise that boundary up a couple clicks off the actual floor to get around that. 3rd the gadgets are very difficult to grab. 4th theres too much uninterruptable talking! 5th once you have played a level, theres simply no Replayability. This game should drop the ""mission"" structure and go with Procedually generated levels that utilize the gadgets and basic framework so that the game levels are always different! If not this game will suffer..",This is a fun VR game but whenever it scanned my surroundings it doesn't pick up the furniture,"This game is so much fun, it's really immersive to play in passthrough using your own home as the crime scene, it's a really innovative way to play and it makes for a very compelling and engaging experience."
