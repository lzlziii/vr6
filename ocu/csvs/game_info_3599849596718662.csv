Hanna in a Choppa 3,"Take flight in the latest instalment of the hugely popular Hanna in a Choppa series of games. This time, in fabulous 3D VR on the Rift and Quest, rather than crappy old 2D Flash. Guide Hanna through 10 bonkers levels, each with hidden secrets and achievements. Train your pet elephant Stompy, steal honey from pesky bees, humiliate upgraded OXOBot at his own game, and of course, The Button makes a spectacular return. Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/cVw7frwNSk As authentic to the original as possible! This game is a labour of love while also extending the core concept wildly. It's also very, very orange! Includes over 60 unlockable Oculus achievements and 10 custom animated items for your Oculus Home. Can you get them all?",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Flying",English,1.9.4,Deeperbeige Games,Deeperbeige Games,https://deeperbeige.com/1370/hanna-in-a-choppa-3/,"Dec 14, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3599849596718662/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3599849596718662&r=1, http://deeperbeige.com/files/PrivacyPolicy_TOS.pdf",151.0 MB,"I've only played the first 2 levels, but I can't wait to see what's next! It's amazing how many great free puzzle games are in app lab, while poorly executed crap like After The Fall and Battle Sister go for 30 to 40 bucks on the main store...","Left in game message also, can't get enough I'm puzzled why thus is free caus it is mor challenging then ANY game I hav played!! Tell me there's a part 1 and 2 that I missed caus I need this in my life! I'm being dead honest game is the most fun, addictive, and can't wait to see more game I hav played!!( and moss is in my library guys) nobody needs to even think twice about getting thus game and FREE can't wait for more developer more plzzzz☺☺","In the beginning it looks like a small and simple game, but every level adds a new mechanic, every new vehicle a new challenge. Speedruns, secrets, perfects... always a next goal to achieve. Seamless transitions between 2D and 3D, creative puzzles, very orange and even outside the levels there is much to explore. Don't skip this one, no risk in checking if it's something for you, because it's fully free (the reason can be discovered in-game)","Really great arcade puzzle game!! I never played the 2D Hanna 1 and 2 games back in the day, so can't compare them. But this VR version is really charming and has some totally unique VR gameplay ideas. It's also way deeper than it initially looks with hours of replay. I can't believe this is free.","Video review here: https://youtu.be/nxSKDOXSJsM I think it's extremely generous of the developer to release this gem for free, it's so polished and fun to play, you can really tell that they put their hearts into it! Download it now!"
