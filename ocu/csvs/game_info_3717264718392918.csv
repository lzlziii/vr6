But there's a problem with this version. I with there was a better system for room adjustment so I don't accidentally press literally any controller button and fall out the window.,Its overall good. Odd price at the very least but still fun/enjoyable.,"A lot of reviews say it is overpriced or to simple, but I like the arcade style simplicity and the resource management part of it. One part of it is the broken achievements. I got backstabbed by a zombie and got the achievement for throwing a grenade without pulling the pin, I got the achievement for beating level 5 with the NPC when replaying level 3 to find the magic piece thing, I even got the achievement for beating the not-so-secret-anymore 6th level of the game for I don’t even know what. And that in LESS than 3 hours of gameplay",I’ve been wanting this game since I was young now I have a VR headset I decided to buy it the price was quite odd but the game is worth it 100%,"I found it silly fun! I loved it! Great game for all ages! Easy enough to learn, yet still a challenge! Zombies are climbing up after you and you need to throw down at them whatever you find from behind you. Some zombies are easier to knock down than others. I find it a thrill! This game is simple and a great time!"
