Everything about it is great it just needs more recognition. So please people get this game and give it the recognition it deserves🙏 You won’t be disappointed I guarantee it.,"I purchased this game over 8 months ago and all they have done is add an embarrassingly crap firing range. The servers just have tumble weed blowing by and is impossible to find any players. I tried for months to get a real game going and the developer says the servers are fine but if anyone does their homework, the servers are not fine and tons of other people say the same. It’s an absolute ghost town even on discord and the developer says to try to join at certain times because maybe there’s 3 players on sometimes at 7pm in my region LMAO. Go on discord and see for yourself. Anyone there just talks trash and doesn’t play the game or the developer just talks to themselves lol. Any multiplayer server should be swarming with players, and all I ever got was an excuse from them why it’s not popular “but watch out it’s going to be huge” they say haha thumbs down Here come the excuses…. | v",Good game especially if you like quake 3 or unreal tournament but where’s the people only bots,Graphics } ❌ Which reality was mine again ❌Stunning ✅ Good ❌Meh ❌What am I looking at ❌Command Line Interface {Story } ❌This is my life now ❌Love it ❌Average ❌some lore ❌Just another game ✅Absolutely no story { Gameplay} ❌Forged by the Gods ❌Masterpiece ✅Great ❌Good ❌Just another game ❌ehhhhhh ❌Rather help a hamster through college instead ❌Rather sell my left kidney { Game Audio} ❌Explosive Eargasm ❌Most Excellent ✅Good ❌Not Bad ❌ummmmmmm ❌Transformers having a seizure Audience } ✅Adults ✅Teens ✅Kids { Grind } ❌Clone Yourself ❌Achievable in one lifetime ❌Average grind ❌If you want ✅For the Online Leaderboards ❌0% Grind {Difficulty } ❌Unplayable ❌100% Dark Souls ❌Hard AF ✅Increased Brain Activity ❌Easy ❌Did they even try ❌Playable while AFK { Game Time } ❌This is your life now ❌Make a pot of coffee ✅Long (If you take your time and enjoy it) ❌Average ❌Short ❌Wait that was a game?????? { Price } ❌$free.99 ✅Fair Price ❌Only if it's on sale (Oh look.. there's one below) ❌With spare money... sure.. why not ❌Don't Recommend ❌This game also doubles as a money shredder { BUGS} ❌Haven't seen any yet ✅Minor Bugs (won't ruin the experience) ❌Oh you'll notice... ❌Why did they even release this game ❌I thought this game was an ant farm ❌Absolute Disaster
