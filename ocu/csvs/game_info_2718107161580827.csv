Trover Saves the Universe,"From the co-creator of Rick and Morty comes Trover Saves the Universe. Your dogs have been dognapped by a beaked lunatic who stuffed them into his eye holes and is using their life essence to destroy the universe. You're partnered with Trover, a little purple eye-hole monster who isn‚Äôt a huge fan of working or being put in the position of having to save the universe. Only you and Trover can save everything in this bizarre comedy adventure filled with combat, platforming, puzzles, and morally questionable choices ‚Äì created by Justin Roiland! -Control Trover's movements, but not his mouth. He‚Äôs got a lot to say about what‚Äôs going on in the game. -Travel the cosmos to experience a variety of weird alien planets and characters with big personalities. -Upgrade Trover AND YOURSELF with new abilities while evading awkward situations. -Immerse yourself in weirdness.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Interactive Story","English, French (France), German, Italian, Spanish (Spain)",1.0,"Squanch Games, Inc.","Squanch Games, Inc.",http://squanchgames.com/,"Jun 18, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2718107161580827/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=2718107161580827&r=1, https://squanchgames.com/privacy-policy/",3.62 GB,"Review: I love the TV show Rick and Morty, so this was a must buy for me. The jokes are insane funny and on the same level like Rick and Morty. I play this game not for the gameplay, the immersive world or the story. I play it because it makes me laugh the whole time. There is nothing to compare the game to. You have to experience it yourself. But you should like comedies like Rick and Morty. Otherwise it is half as good. If this review was helpful, please leave a üëçüèª down below. Thanks and enjoy.","üí∞DISC. Code üíµ: rb@gy/y6sup ‚ÄúReplace the ‚Äú@‚Äù with a period ‚Äú.‚Äù ‚úÖ Reveiw ‚úÖ This game is bittersweet, especially considering Justin was booted off not only Rick and Morty, but Squanch games, before any legal verdict was reached. That said, this is probably his best work in a game, even better than High on Life, and the Landscapes/Comedic timing is just perfect. Sad that this is probably the last game in my collection with Justin‚Äôs comedy in it. A must have for sure. Overall ‚≠êÔ∏è 10/10 ‚≠êÔ∏è Hit that ‚Äúhelpful üëç‚Äù if Justin Roiland didn‚Äôt do it","Text me for a 25 off code. If you like Rick and Morty (and even if you didn't) you are sure to have a blast with this game, the hilarious and amazing voice acting mixed with the fun gameplay is sure to give you a great time, this was one of the first games I got and is still one of my favorite today. Highly recommend.","This is the most fun I have ever had on the quest! I put my quest down for 4 months only to find this game and play non stop! It‚Äôs funny, immersive, and has a really good story. I laughed out loud a little to much while playing this game. The game allows you to sit while playing and at first I was saddened. Usually vr games don‚Äôt feel as immersive while sitting. However since the character you play is sitting it made easier to get immersed in the game. If you have a problem with cussing I would suggest trying something else as the game doesn‚Äôt have a fully censored option. But if that doesn‚Äôt bother you, then buy it!!",I bought this game as I was looking for something that would make me laugh and I wasn't disappointed. This game is just brilliant. The dialogue is hilarious and the game itself is full of fun. I loved every minute of it. Can't wait for the next.
