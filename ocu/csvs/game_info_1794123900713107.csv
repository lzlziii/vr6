This game was so well designed and put together it kept me grossed through the whole game, even when I felt like giving up a few times my will just wouldn’t let me. I had to save hope from that horrible place lol. That’s how much time and effort the developers put in this game to keep you in gaged. The story line was incredible, very creative and one that will stick with me just like a good book or movie. With all that said I did have 1 question I couldn’t figure out, and that would be at the complete end of the game. When hope gets lifted out of Terminus It’s so amazingly beautiful and I was thinking “ what a perfect ending to a perfect game” but, even though it was so beautiful and it would of been great for the first 3 or 4 minutes, but it’s endless, there’s no end, and if there is an end then how long do you have to look up at the ascension before it’s over? Because I stayed with it ,it seemed like forever to no end. So when I got back on to play again it shows I didn’t even finish the game and it brings me back to fixing the cooling center and being lifted out again and again there’s no end? What the hell, there’s no satisfaction in that, it take’s away all that work you put in to saving hope just to leave her stuck in that ascension to no end. Bummer to say the least, but I would very much recommend this game to anyone that loves a good story line and wants a game that not only engages the player mind but also challenges there will. Loved it!!","I loved the game! They found a perfect way to put you on the 3D world, but w/o movements that could cause motion sickness. It's an amazing tactical game, where you help a rebellion member to scape from a militar facility in a dystopian world. You're a hacker using cameras and devices to help and orient the fugitive! Download it now! Seriously.","I played republique on tiny screen mobile years ago and boy what an amazing upgrade! The vr gameplay experience is very cool, the plot is amazing esp if you explore hidden books/cassettes.",I really enjoy playing this game I always loose track of time I’m very glad that you have a watch in your hand to show how long you’ve been playing I like to play about 30 minutes a day this is a lot of fun I can’t wait to play other games from these creators,"it certainly would have been worth paying for, but it has more of an Oculus GO Vibe (a thing I consider to be or have been good) than I was expecting. its still a fun thing to have a game where gaze based selection and locomotion are at the forefront. blah blah blah."
