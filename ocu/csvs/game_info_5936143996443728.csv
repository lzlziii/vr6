The gameplay of Elysium Trials is fast-paced and fun! üòÑ Forget games like Pistol Whip, this is the shooter to rule all shooters!, it stands out from the crowd too as it's fantasy and not the usual sci-fi gun type games we are all used to. Elysium offers something fresh and new and it does it incredibly well. The environments are beautiful, Elysium is a very immersive VR game that transports you to a fantasy world complimented by a heavy metal soundtrack which when combined really adds to the intensity of the whole experience. And if thats not enough! Man it's hard! Like old school hard. When you finally place on a leader board you feel pretty accomplished getting there! This game demands skill, speed and precision! I like that the devs have added a 'bullet proof' feature. This allows you to get to grips with the mechanics better without getting blasted out of the water. And how the gameplay is structured into trials giving you something to work towards each time. Again this has an old school arcade feel that i find very appealing. For future updates i would love to see a wider variety of enemy that respond in different ways so you can switch up tactics. I feel like there's lots of potential here as the battle mechanics are so good! Its pretty obvious a lot of thought and design went into them. The game also has a lot of unlockable content, such as weapon skins and achievements which we all love. I would 100% recommend you check out Elysium Trails, it's most definitely a worthy addition to your game collection. ‚ù§Ô∏è","I am in awe of how beautiful the graphics are. Everything is so vivid, you feel completely immersed. The tutorial is very clear and gameplay is simple to figure out. With a crossbow in one hand and a wand in the other, you glide through gorgeous scenes shooting and attacking enemies. I easily play sitting down, but still have to bob and dodge enemy attacks. There are easy and warriors modes, and if you are good enough you can even make the leaderboard! This game is not your average rail shooter! The developers have done a great job in creating a smooth, fully immersive fantasy game. I highly recommend picking this one up!!","Omg! since i heard about this upcoming release i was so excited!! and now its here! yikes its amazing! its like Pistol Whip on steroids! the mechanics are superbly done, and love the fact this is not a one shot and you completed the trials! it teally makes uou work hard for your achivement! and boy when you get on that leader board you will be punching the air with joy üòÖ love the fact you can change the difficulty so you take less damage and can sail through a trial so you can kinda practice yiur skills. you can forge new stronger weapons which is really neat! there is nothing at all you can say bad about this shooter on rails! its just what the quest needed! as we have all be shouting out for a new shooter on rails!! well its here!! and in abundance with this game!! it literally has it all! well done devs! its only upwards from here! sky is the limit ü§© well done! im loving this game!!"
