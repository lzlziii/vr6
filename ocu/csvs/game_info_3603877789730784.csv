Keep working on it and it will become more popular,"I've had an amazing time with this game with it's wacky geometry and Portal antics. Everytime I play (either with friends or public lobbies) I always have a blast! And some of the people I've seen on this game are extremely creative with their own styles I've never seen before. Gonna miss this game and the wacky lobbys/Players it brought with it, best of luck on your next project <3","See, the concept of this game is great. But the bots get kinda annoying. Their should be an option to turn off bots and a smaller map with that. So me and my friend could play like a 1v1 type thing. Thanks for the great game I hope their are more updates coming soon.","So, I found this game when it first came out and it looked very cool, and I tried it out, did the tutorial, and it was fun. Only one tiny problem was, THERE WAS NO PLAYERBASE!! Thank god that people found this underrated game. Another small problem is that I always get lost in maps.. yâ€™all should add more variety to platform textures, and turn down the fog a littleâ€¦ other than that, Itâ€™s a great game, totally underrated! 9/10 UPDATE: I just found out that this game is dead again and it hurts to see nobody plays this anymore. I also just found out the servers are going down May 2022! Rest In Peace Upenders, you were an amazing game while you lasted.ðŸ˜”"
