And ping pong in vr is a blast. Anyways I wondered how this game would be and having read the reviews I pulled the trigger and bought Racket Fury. And I'm glad I did buy it lots of fun. I like the environments and robot opponents a lot better in Racket Fury then Eleven. This game is fun, point blank. And good excercise. I'd give it a 5 star but I feel like there is a slight glitch in the paddle detection on the far right side. Long story short ping pong was made for VR, gotta ahead and but this game, it's a blast!",This game deserves a 5 star rating. It is so good. I tried Eleven vr I had not enough spaces and less options to practice. But with this game you don't need that much spaces and it has so many options when u want to practice against A.I. I recommend this game a lot. You should also buy it in the next 7 days because instead of paying 20$ it is only 11.99$. Very worth it.,I have played a lot of table tennis since I was young and I am now fifty. This game in arcade feels close to reality. Great work. I hope it will be kept up to date and work flawlessly on soon to be released Quest 3 too. If you love table tennis then buy this game.,"Brilliant game. I v got both tabletennis games for the quest, i keep coming back to this one most of the time. I prefer fast low raleigh's on simulation mode, its fantastic. The ball dynamics feels near it for sure, i have played with best buddies in reality for years. The practice mode is good for homing in on skills and the AI opponents keep you occupied enough, one suggestion, it woud be nice if there were a few more AI characters with different styles, or a game where we coud play up to 22 instead of 11, longer games. Thanks for the amazing game, don t change them ball dynamics, its great.","I have done solo games and am comfortable. But when I try to play with someone, it take to some rooms with different country names and there is nobody in it. How do I play online? In championship it shows only one . Others are locked. How to open those. I have won many games and reached 11"
