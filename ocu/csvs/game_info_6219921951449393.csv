There's good variety in enemy types. And it's good shooting fun with gun upgrades and good perks. --- What the game does need: I would really like it if we could walk in the lobby so I could get closer to the game windows while seating. The hit radius on enemies is pretty big and I think it should be nerfed a fair bit.,"This is a very addicting game which never turns boring. Tho the one thing that I see that needs fixing are the perks that involve gold none of them really work, like the one you need to survive for 50 seconds to get 250 gold but the only gold I get is from killing the boss. But other than that the game gives hours of fun and fast paced gameplay.","I was expecting to hop in for a few minutes and have a bit of fun. I ended up playing for hours, grinding progression and trying out new weapon/perk combos. I would happily increase my rating to 5 stars, but I ran into a pretty major issue. Weapon pickups don't work on the second stage. They either act like solid walls or you pass through them with no option to equip. It seems the devs are active in to reviews here; please fix this so I can get back to grinding! Lol","Ok so from a VR veterans point of view, gameplay is simple and to the point. However I was met with more than I expected. Full set of unlockable weapons even if there's not 100, a decent list of achievements and looks like we have 3 levels to choose from in this rouge like monster shoot em up. Power ups, health, different weapons pop up in battle, wave upon waves of various monsters, and there are grenade pick ups similar to COD zombies that nuke em all out. I don't mind the gameplay I was surprised and thought it was going to be much worse. Now for the real talk. We need smooth turning first off, I did not find an option for that, and there weren't many so I'm guessing it's not there. Height adjustment is nice if your sitting. We need manual reload or at least something like zombieland to speed things up a bit. Graphics are ok, it's a work in progress and I can see the love being put in here. Im gonna keep it in the library hopefully we'll see some updates soon ü§òüòÅ","My type of personality, I get bored quickly. This game keeps me on my toes like Broadway Joe. Thank you for such a masterpiece. Finally, a creature of a game with some type of original thought."
