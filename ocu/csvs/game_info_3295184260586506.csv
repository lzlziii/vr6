I’ve also had cases of falling out of the map and having to relaunch the game to fix it. If they fix the bugs and spice up the game it would be good..",If your game won’t load. Make sure you have an updated headset. Uninstall and then reinstall. Make sure you allow permissions. Should work then.,one thing for the game add some more maps and when we go to peoples private server its very buggy to shoot in the game and fix the ai to anyways thats all i got peace.
