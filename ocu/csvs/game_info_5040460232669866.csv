Squirrel Day,"Squirrel Day is a VR platformer about climbing, exploring, and collecting. Use your paws to crawl, jump, and grab to travel around the tree branches and collect the nuts as fast as possible. -- Physics-based movement system. Move your hands to move your body. Push off of any surface to move in the opposite direction. -- Use the index triggers to grab any surface. -- Use the grip trigger to point and interact with your watch -- Use watch to change display refresh rate (72 or 90Hz) and adjust snap turn angle or enable smooth turning -- Use either thumbstick to rotate -- Arrow indicator on watch will point to nearest nut. -- Timer starts when first nut is collected. ATTENTION! This is an early version. I'm still optimizing art and finishing up the level designs. Hope you enjoy it! Email granitetopgames@gmail dot com with any feedback or issues.
