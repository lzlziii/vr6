I used to love SingStar on my friend's playstation. So happy to see it on here. The drumming and shooting game are my new favorite games. Its a workout without feeling like I'm working out. I could play for hours just like the old Rock Band video game. I hope if this releases that the music library stays as large and open and not behind paywall per song. The demo for shooting game could be better to explain what do to. After a few tries in actual game I think I have it because I made it to the end.,"This game is wonderful and while I'm not big on the drums part, I love the kareoke and shooting sections (and that beautiful planetary view from your home penthouse). I haven't sang with anyone on multiplayer yet, but I plan to soon. Because I don't believe a lot of people are using this game or not at the same time at least, your better joining with someone familiar until a community starts developing if your hoping to sing with people. A few points: -There are very little glitches, which is nice. But sometimes my avatar arm/shoulder stays in my vision unless I jank it around or reset view - I would love to be able to pick up my microphone in my hand to sing with (even if there is no other effect but holding the mike-its like when you grab a remote to sing into, it doesnt do anything but you feel like a star) -Unless i'm missing the option, avatars so far only have 1 skin tone, which is white. Having more customization options (i:e, skin tone) would be wonderful.",So happy that you put starmaker on VR. I would love to be able to combine my starmaker profiles on my mobile phone to the starmaker VR and interact on both formats. It would be nice if you had something somewhere that told you how much this app will cost whether it will be a one-time charge or a monthly charge.,Began Learning via the Mobile App . Enjoying the VR version . Can't wait to PARTY Live .,"One of the tracks was just a bit different,smh Cotton eyed joe track just doesnâ€™t fit today"
