Mecha Force,"Mecha Force is an immersive and exciting VR experience that blends the thrill of mecha action with the unpredictability of a roguelike game. Players are transported to a world in turmoil, where they must defend against both internal and external threats as they take control of their very own mecha. This is no ordinary machine, however; the player is able to customize and personalize their mecha, choosing from a diverse range of artillery and melee weapons to create their own formidable war machine. The key to success in Mecha Force is the player's ability to become one with their mecha. This requires a deep understanding of the machine's capabilities and limitations, as well as the development of skills and tactics to maximize the mecha's potential. Through practice and repetition, players will increase their synchronization rate with their mecha, enabling them to unleash their full power in battle. Your journey won't be easy. They'll face off against a wide range of alien invaders and massive Kaiju monsters, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Players must strategize and adapt, using their mecha's arsenal and their own cunning to outmaneuver their foes and emerge victorious.",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Shooting, Simulation",English,"1.9.6

You pilot a mech Pacific Rim style, where your arm movements are mirrored by the mech. There's a cockpit so you can see both yourself and the mech, 1st person view. There's guns, beam sabers, secondary attacks, special bar. The walking and Dash do seem a little slow, also there is no side-dash. I would also like to see a small jump-dash. The environment is pretty plain and boring. There's a few stages then a mini boss, then a few more stages, then a boss. I beat the demo, but it took me multiple tries. Overall, it's very unfinished and bare, but if a lot more work is put into it, it could be an amazing game.","Hey, I'm not a pervert, but I find it a very strange situation that the ""host"" has grabable... ok, never mind, the hand controllers on the EVA are strange, it took me a while to calibrate the correct movement, such Instead limiting the edges with a buzzer (sound or vibration) would be perfect. In general, I felt like a teenager again with daddy problems and the desire to destroy neo-futuristic angels.",A very great game and I‚Äôm a big pacific rim fan so i Personally love this game and no one can change my mind and if somehow you‚Äôre able to make it better I will be possibly one of the first reviews on itÔøº,"Totally satisfying for a Japanese anime and super robot fan, looking forward to future updates!"
