Towerport,"A VR tower defense experience where you function as both general and soldier. As the newly appointed Sky Marshall you oversee the defense effort and take on the enemy with bow, zeppelin, and battle orbs! STRATEGY AND ACTION As the sole defender of the realm, you will need to be an effective archer as well as a fast-thinking strategist. The enemy is persistent and strong, and will often attack more than one front. Your ability to keep calm, build the right towers on the right spots, freezing a group of enemies with your battle orbs while nailing head-shots with your bow, will be crucial to your success ADAPT AND PREVAIL Throughout your missions, you will confront gradually tougher enemies with various skill sets and stats. No single strategy works for them all. You will have to adapt and experiment with alternative tactics to succeed.",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Strategy",English,0.3,Barrelcry,Barrelcry,https://barrelcry.com/,"Sep 1, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/7805743412834399/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=7805743412834399&r=1, https://barrelcry.com/privacy-policy/",721.7 MB,"I really enjoy the game's vibes. The time spent on the zeppeliner during battles, just taking in the gorgeous scenery, is a real treat. The mix of active player combat and tower defense is a lot of fun, especially when played in VR.",Good combat ï¿¼,"This is game is very well designed and I live the use of a bow both to teleport and shoot, as well as the ability to upgrade weapons outside of the levels. My main issue, however, is simply that I haven't yet been able to pass level 3 as it is incredibly difficult, but playing is still a great experience. I think that more towers or upgrades to the towers besides the explosives would also be great, but given the extremely cheap price, the game has quite a lot of content",Great combination of strategi and action.
