It might even get you off your feet! Play competitively or just friendly. Lounge around throw some darts interact with others and have more friendly duels! People in the community are very friendly, competitive, and helpful. Join the discord! The only draw back I had was figuring out how to get new weapons. It wasn’t very clear on how to do it but I guess eventually you’ll figure it out after you mastered all of your current weapons. Scrap the drawback. This helped me master the weapons and really hone in on some great tactics and load outs strategies.","So I’ve been playing this game for 2 or 3 years can’t remember, and it has been so fun!!! When I first got the game it costed $10 I believe I played it for a while, I discovered their YouTube channel and got pretty good I wars around 500-800 then I got out of it and didn’t play it for a LOOONNNG time but I played it every once and a while. When it became free and I played it for a while, I got like 50 dollars worth of ingame currency just because I bought it for 10 before it was free!!! About a month ago I came back and I absolutely love it it’s just so fun I literally play it every chance I get. My rank is now 1456, 5 stars (get it it’s free!!!!!)","I really like the gameplay, it really gets your body moving. You can also hang out in bars, to find some new opponents. It’s really fun, but I would like an update to make it so you can mute certain people. Some people can say some bad stuff, I even heard young children say some bad stuff. That’s my only complaint though. It doesn’t happen too often, but it happens enough for an update for that to happen. It’s very fun, playing, watching, and just hanging out. I highly recommend this game to anyone who needs something to take away their free time. Bro, why you scrolling? The review’s over. I’m telling ya, don’t scroll. Bro, you serious? Ok… you have heart, I’ll give you that. Here’s a text art for your work. 🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦 🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥 🟦⬜️⬜️⬜️🟦 🟥⬜️⬜️⬜️🟥 🟦🟦⬜️🟦🟦 🟥🟥⬜️🟥🟥 🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦 🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥 🟦🟦🟦🟦🟦 🟥🟥🟥🟥🟥","This game is fun, and I don’t see any pay-to-win stuff. You can just buy a few skins. Great game, simple and fun but also can get very tactical very quickly. Doubles or a 3-4 player free-for-all would be a wild additions feature that I would gladly pay for."
