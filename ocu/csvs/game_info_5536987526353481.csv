Third Dimension Fitness,"Third Dimension Fitness is a Mixed Reality app to Make Cardio Fun by immersing users on Fitness Equipment like a Treadmill into Virtual Worlds and making them participate in engaging activities. It allows users to run on a treadmill and relax in in different environments or play games or just interact with the virtual world to distract their minds and help them stay engaged during their workout for better results. Safety: This application uses propriety design to use a Mixed Reality Window to the real world through which users can see their treadmill controls and the surrounding world. The users get a chance to modify the window's position while calibrating and setting up.

I really enjoy this game, I see the potential. I hope it‚Äôs a one time purchase with ‚Äúpacks‚Äù that you can purchase that include: music, environments, workouts, & intensity; as opposed to a monthly subscription. I‚Äôd much rather spend $30+ on an app and purchase add ons rather than being stuck with a monthly subscription.","I have this but can't get into it, it comes up with hand controllers not connected",this app is amazing and life changing. i used it for 5 minutes and ran so fast i lost like 2 pounds instantly. best app ever please download it you‚Äôre missing out. god bless üôèüèª,"I tried this game yesterday, and was wowed by the innovation. the open window to see through pass-through is genius.
