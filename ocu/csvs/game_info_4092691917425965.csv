You actually feel like you are in the game Honestly this is the only game I play. Join the discord asap and be good or you'll be banned In discord you'll find there is a league with stats and even a twitch channel to watch league games There is A and B leagues and an open league where you can join or form a team of your own from other members on discord who are 'registered' to play Plenty of players hence the three leagues and plenty of players in pubs, the games mp server's where players pick a team and join ongoing twenty minutes matches that restart immediately after the last one ended. I forgot to mention the leagues have many in the community managing everything from drafts to stats. The game is bigger than it looks when you join the discord Fun game. Best sports game imo. Edit to link a presentation/broadcast/stream of one of the league games. A league, I think. But it showcases the gameplay of skilled players and also a small part of what the community has come up with. There are other casters and announcers and to be a caster you would have to apply, be selected, and follow rules. The game is bigger than what appears if you aren't in on the discord twitch tv/thetexaszip. For some current league matches.",I’ve been playing this game a lot even manage to get on the scoreboard. Have a awesome games with awesome people. What’s even more awesome is that you can join the lead that I right now is in OL which is one of the leagues I have a fun time playing with friends and meeting new people why I give this game is five stars is because of the game play at all the awesome people probably the best part of this game is a Community,Really good developed hockey game make sure to watch the tutorial so you know what to do,terrible graphics and gameplay,"Been playing this game for 3 years. As the game and players have evolved, people started discovering exploits and cheesy ways of winning. While some of them have been somewhat fixed, here are still some that are very prominent that make the game nearly unplayable. Starting with neutral zone shots: nothing has been done to fix these. These throw out any playmaking or creativity, which is what this game is about. Such a broken way of scoring and winning games yet nothing has been done about it. Next, heigh glitching: many players now are lowering their height to get more reach in game. While there has been an attempt to fix this, it didn’t go as planned. Hoping to see a proper solution for this issue soon. (There are a couple more minor exploits that I won’t bring up because they do seem hard to find a solution to) There is no longer a focus on playing with your teammates or trying to make creative plays. It’s become a long shot/ internet competition. I still have hope for the game, but with how long these problems have been around with no fix, that hope is starting to fade"
