Starfighter Arduxim,"Strap into the cockpit of your Arduxim starfighter and take on enemy starships in this first-person tactical space shooter. Navigate through dangerous ice crystal fields, travel through hyper gates to other systems, take on enormous capital ships and more. Control your ship using Touch controllers, a gamepad, or hand tracking. Players can use the thumb sticks on a physical controller, or for a more immersive experience grab virtual cockpit controls using the Touch controllers or your bare hands. Includes: * A fourteen mission story based campaign covering your first tour of duty on the front lines * Multiplayer to test your skills against other pilots * Survival/horde challenge mode with online leader board * Tutorial * Practice mode",7+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Gamepad, Touch (as Gamepad), Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Simulation, Space/Universe",English,2.4.3,Fulby Technologies,Fulby Technologies,https://fulby.tech/,"Sep 3, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3922592214493334/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3922592214493334&r=1, https://www.fulby.tech/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,1.19 GB,"This is one of the best space titles I've seen for the Quest 2 and very reasonably priced. It is more immersive than most in that you have to depart from your hanger and then warp to a different area of space for every mission before finally returning to your hanger. Most games just start you in the level straight away but this game really feels like you're travelling into space to begin these missions yourself. There are also detailed briefings that are presented to you in a conference room, this is way better than just having a wall of text thrown at you. Plus it has a massive amount of customisable options in the menu to optimize gameplay, which I think is very important. The space craft handling is smooth, the graphics and sound effects are great. I prefer to turn the in-game music off to really immerse myself. There's locomotion too so when stationary you can actually walk out of your ship and look around it. My one and only criticism is that I wish there were more ships you could fly. There's only 2, one of which is only playable in multiplayer mode. The VR Gear version of this game had a different ship with reasonably sized living quarters behind the cockpit, maybe put that in ths Quest 2 version as well? Other than that, a fantastic game.",Finally a space shooter in VR,"up date, Thank you for the answer, it was my mistake yes i met the green square. 5 stars great game ‐---‐------------------------------------- One of the best game for the price ever if you like sciencfiction and dogfight. For the developer , the third mission, were you colect data trough asteroids going trough green square to colect data,,,,, one of the green square is on the asteroid so you canot go near or through it ...so you canot complet totaly the mission.....unless it make that way to make you go explore and end up on the enemie game....anyway it not a negative note,,,the game is excellent I bought it .... and considering the price,,,,it the best deal ever......and excellent game,,,ant it still under developement ,,,,,, I give 5 stars....","I have an addiction to all things science fiction and as soon as I got my Quest 2 I was on the hunt for a game like this and as many space experiences as I could find. I have to declare that I'm impressed with what appears to be the work of just one guy pulling together a lot of assets (not to denigrate it for that, it would be an impossible task for one to achieve otherwise). The price is incredibly good value and I was more than happy to splash on it and because of that it is why I'm driven to enthuse on it here in support. It's still in beta so could do with a few tweaks in the audio areas to make the guns feel beefier and some of the voice acting feels like I'm being offered a nice cup of tea when the instruction is to escape for my life, but that's easy fixes. And the canon fire itself looks a bit 90s, the flak canons are straight out of Space Harrier which came out in '85! But I say that with love because I have nothing but respect for this achievement and want it to do really well, as it deserves. Buy this game and help support it!","For its price, it is amazing. They could sell this for 10 and it would be fine. The voice acting is meh but that’s fine. Multiplayer isn’t that bad either. If you are not shur, get the free multiplayer demo. Oh yeah, go into the settings and raise the refresh rate ad resolution. Overall, amazing game."
