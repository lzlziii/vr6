Your given a few options to load on the battle field. Your Energy loads as time goes. Your opponent will try and load there battle died with better troops to take you out. Don’t let them get to close! If they take out your towers it’s only the beginning! Lol hop on give it a try definitely worth a try.❤️,"You should support pass though mode, then I want different units to have their own monologue or voiceover","This game is soooo much fun! I can’t believe this game is free. Multiplayer is a blast! My cousin and I are addicted to this game! This is an extremely well made tower defense game with fantastic highly polished graphics. Lots of imaginative characters and vehicles that animate very well. As you progress you can get more characters. Best of all you can shrink and enlarge the playfield by just moving your hands in and out like in the game Demeo. What an incredible perspective when the chracters are full size and you are standing right in the middle of the battle. Great theme music too! It looks like they are still working on it and I hope to see some improvements in the following areas. When joining multiplayer it just randomly looks for an online player for you. This should be done with a room code. Since this is new you will probably be joined with your friend since not many have discovered this game yet. Also, instead of gaining new characters randomly as you play, you should gain credits that you build up as you play and be able to choose who your next character is based on your credits. Also, the sound effects you can only hear when you get closer to the action. There should be an option to increase the sound of the effects to increase immersion. Overall this is a great game with tons of replay value. Hope to see this in the main store once completely finished. It’s so close to being perfect!",Looks great and it seems pretty fun. It would be nice to be able to resize the selection arm band menu. It seems to be a bit to large for me. I can hardly wait for more to be added. I really am compelled to fly around in the ship and explore the planets. A space walk around the ship would be pretty cool too. Looking so cool so far! I love all the fine details and great designs. The animation it outstanding. I love how you can get right up to things face to face. It's awesome! Keep up the awesome work. Oh and the discord link doesn't work! It expired or something. Need a new invite.
