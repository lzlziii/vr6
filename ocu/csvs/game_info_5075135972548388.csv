The. Game. It has soooo much to do, the base game is already fun enough and worth it, with the learning curve for swimming, and at the end u go ULTRA FAST, the collectables u can find on the ground (and fight for) all the battle mechanics, the creatures, the sharks, the HORROR MODE, yes that's right, there's a whole other horror game inside this one. But that's not even the best part. This game has A LOT of secrets, and when I mean a lot, I mean that we haven't still figured out everything in all this time. There are also other secrets, for those who don't really care about lore (btw this game has some fnaf level lore, ik, bold claim, but trust me) there are other secrets: secret collectables! These are very valuable, and expect ppl to try and steal them lmao. But it's really fun, and some collectables even require more steps than just finding them and picking them up, so u have to figure that out. And wanna know the best part? Glitches. Oh my god the glitches. U can go from just clipping ur hand through the ground with a specific item in a specific place by doing a specific movement, to literally sending someone to the shadow realm, where their only option is to reset their game to escape. So, to recap: play the game, it's free, fun, and u got nothing to loose except ur time (which u won't, bc I assure u this game is fun af).",So one day I changed my name from pumpkinmonke to fluroXD then when I started playing it I noticed I lost everything I had and Iâ€™m not sure why pls just pls can you transfer my items back to me and make my day and also itâ€™s a great game and recommend it to others. Thank you so much devs and yes trollhunter is my friend Iâ€™m going to message her now to change it ðŸ™‚,The game is great but i will do a update idea you should make you could eat the fishes that are around the map and could you please add more sea animals its your opinion,Can you please add mods And when you go to the island can you please add it where when your on the floaty you wonâ€™t go back down Cause more people will come to his game if thereâ€™s mods,"I love this game so much, it gives me vibes. But when the update comes out, I'm not able to play it because blade and sorcery has a bug and I can't fix it. Please don't update it so I can play. This is the most game I play in oculus, I can't even play gorilla tag. Please read this and if you still decide to update it, it's okay. I'll just play gorn all the time since it doesn't have any incoming update. Have a nice day and bye forever Squid Smack. ðŸ˜”"
