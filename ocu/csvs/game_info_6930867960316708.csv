However, the devs seem to have saved up their vacation days! Haven’t had an update for months. And I mean months like almost a year…I think multiplayer, simplistic Air Traffic Control, and more aircraft would make it better…","When it downloads the take off blue band it is really entertaining and well worth the money . .Today flown in Italy ,Grand Canyon.and Venice. By plane and by helicopter. Which I prefer as gives one better view my opinion…..but when it does not work it is so bloody annoying,the blue band loading as other buyers have found gets stuck on about 96% full and seems to freeze.If this problem could be resolved. would be great…..",Caution this sim seems to work the odd time when loading It could have been a great sim if the developer had sorted out the glitches But now the bad bit it has stopped working ..get to first screen select your options then click the fly button but the next screen only loads to 90% then just spins ... The odd time it dose load it only half loads with lots of black circles floating about and only half the background loads with lots of white space. And unable to fly ..... This could have been a great sim if it worked ... Please don't spend your cash on this until the developer sorts out the problems....,"I get to the main screen where I can pick the plane or the helicopter, set all the different parameters and hit takeoff, comes to a new screen that says loading and blue line going across gets about 98% filled and doesn’t go any further for whatever reason and I let it sit there for 45 minutes and nothing happens. I’m on an Oculus 2 VR headset.. Is there a cliche? Or what? Fix please",I feel this “app lab” is somewhat of a con encouraging users to buy into further game development when the developer has no intention of developing further. Poor.
