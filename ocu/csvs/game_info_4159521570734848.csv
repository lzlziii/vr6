Journey to Alien Worlds,"With this virtual reality experience, you don’t need a bulky spacesuit anymore to travel into outer space and land on planets, satellites or comets in our Solar System. Now you can experience how it feels to stand on the surface of these bodies, view the amazing scenery there, and get a better understanding of the differences between these heavenly bodies and the Earth. You can also bear witness to mankind’s great accomplishments in the exploration of outer space and get to know the landers and probes used and their designs. Currently you can experience the following sights: 1) The Moon and the Apollo Lunar Module 2) Venus and Venera 7 3) Mars and the Curiosity rover 4) Mars and the Perseverance rover 5) Titan and the Huygens probe 6) 67P Comet, the Rosetta probe and the Philae lander 7) Saturn and the Cassini orbiter",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Space/Universe, Travel",English,1.1,Ideographer,Ideographer,https://ideographer.com/vr/,"Sep 9, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4159521570734848/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4159521570734848&r=1, https://ideographer.com/vr/privacy.html",1.26 GB,"I love space. I love the idea of flying through space and being able to visit other planets. So naturally this program was a necessity. But it falls short. The beginning visit to Saturn is awe inspiring. It really makes you feel like you are there. Unfortunately, it's downhill from there. The visits to Venus and Mars start out well but then deteriorate once you ""land"" on the surface and can't even freely turn in your ""stationary"" spot. You can click-turn in a circle but, come on, this is VR. You then have to ""teleport"" to the next spot (10 feet away) and do it again. The same thing happens on the Moon and on an asteroid. And, with the very brief bits about a couple of Saturn's moons, you're done. That's right. Not even all of the planets are available. A shame. At roughly $6. it certainly isn't going to break me and I won't request a refund but the creators of this simulation should really finish the job. Again...SO much potential to be something truly breathtaking.","Graphically dull. Clunky controls. Poor menu system. Instantly nausea inducing because the unnecessary space sequences have stupid camera moves. Brink shows how good graphics can be on a Quest, this doesn't. Titans of Space shows how good education VR can be, this doesn't. All in all, a compete waste of space.","This is a very educational app, very good for kids to understand more about the galaxy, love it!!",let down by lack of free movement/smooth turning on the surface of planets.
