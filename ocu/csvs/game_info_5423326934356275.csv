It is really well done. So far, it is one of my top museum and the best art museum on Oculus. Possible improvements. - allow the user to show a map with the user location - add the name of the artist for each painting, a way to reach out to that artist, the price of the painting (if possible) and the size. Also add a description of the author and the painting too, and where and when was this painted. This would help with the artists exposure. - give a choice of chatter box (people talking in the background), music, or just listening to your steps, or just silence - add non moving ""cameras"" on the ceiling - add some windows and lights so we don't feel so claustrophobe. This requires a bit of work since the outside probably should match the current time... aka at night, it should be dark. During the day it should be brighter.","A must try if you like museums, has fun interaction, fitting relaxing music and just tons of good art!","nice art. Not totally scintillating, but still colorful and fun. I liked the structure of the gallery and use of geometry and stuff, blah blah."
