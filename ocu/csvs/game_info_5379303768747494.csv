Dungeon Maker,"Greetings My Lord ! üëë I hath heard thou art quite the dungeon connoisseur, so i maketh this bawbling passthrough system where thee can buildeth thy owneth dungeon using a variety of traps and items, as well as lodging waypoints to giveth goals to the dungeon seekers. üè∞ What can I expect from my dungeon?? Fear not Sire, there is much: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Proceduraly generated plot and a treasure to go with it. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Hand tracking and presence! Use your hands to bring up your Orb of Quests as well as interact with the world. 3Ô∏è‚É£ A variety of slashing, crushing and deadly traps. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Lava floor! 5Ô∏è‚É£ Quest items such as waypoints and keys (that open doors). 6Ô∏è‚É£ Occlusion boxes to occlude your own furniture. 7Ô∏è‚É£ Walls to build around your dungeon. 8Ô∏è‚É£ A save / load system so you don't need to keep rebuilding each time! (Even tough it's fun to build, let's be honest.)",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Arcade",English,0.20.1,Field Of Vision,Field Of Vision,https://fieldof.vision/,"Apr 16, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5379303768747494/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5379303768747494&r=1, https://www.fieldof.vision/PrivacyPolicy.html",259.5 MB,"The game is great! And I can‚Äôt wait for the next update! I do think you should add more stuff, like to be able to place a key in one dungeon witch opens a key door in an other dungeon or links like pressure plate doors or lever doors and you can add a crate you can pick up and put on the pressure plate for the door to open! although they might be hard to code‚Ä¶ but l love the game and I made about 8 dungeons! But when you‚Äôre boundary is lost it might be hard to fix but there is a ‚Äúmove all‚Äù button and it works but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt line up with when you originally had it but at least you can move stuff separately!I definitely recommend the game!!!","Love building dungeons for my son, but it won't let me load any saved dungeons other than Dungeon 0. I am up to Dungeon 4, and none of them show up to Load in the menu. Looking forward to any updates to this one. Very fun.",This game is good but I feel that things are often too big/small for my needs. It would be nice if everything like the floor holes and the ceiling bar thing could be changed in length/size Also it would be nice if all the assets were in color for the pro then have a b&w filter for the quest version since some items have color on them Also also it would be nice if you could establish a grid system to line stuff up better since houses are usually grid based architecturally (it would also help recalibrate when the tracking goes weird),"I spent half a day without putting down headset creating 3 stage dungeon across three rooms for my daughter and saved it, but when i put down my headset for a minute and then put it back on and loaded dungeon, all three was turned cca 90 degrees off, therefore became unplayable, it happened 2 times. You can imagine my feelings after this disapointment. Would give one star, but i had fun creating those dungeons. I have no idea why is this happening.","When I try to place a treasure, it tells me that I've already placed one, and won't let me place another, despite the fact that no treasure has been placed. Please fix. Otherwise, it's great fun. You can string together dungeons to make a long challenge. Would be lots of fun at VR parties"
