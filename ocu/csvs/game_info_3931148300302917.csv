I’ve played games on PC, consoles, handhelds, phone, VR, etc. I play everything from RPG, FPS, sports games, etc. Ive had my Meta Quest 2 for about two years and this is my favorite game by far. I always come back to this game when I need to escape and relax. They are constantly updating with new puzzles. I highly recommend for anyone that loves puzzles or just enjoys a great game that always had new content.","Your probably thinking Puzzels...BORING ! Its Fantastic Eye-candy you'll be Proud of upon completing each of the many available ! Puzzels can visually be seen not only outside but inside and 360° I was amazed upon discovering this. Offers an endless challenge At first I took it slow and easy at starting with 50 pieces till I got the hang of the program and image. Next, I did the same puzzle but with 100 pieces, which still offered me the same challenge but, tried to do it faster. I'm definitely a fan of this sleeper and highly recommend it !","I love reading reviews but I'm a sucker when it comes to write them but this one has made me change my mind. I've been using VR since the beginning and something that most (not all) of modern games lack of is inmerse the user inside the game world. It's funny as in this one you don't travel to far planets or discover the depths of a cave while swinging your torch around, but yet it can easily make 3 hours of your life seemed like 20 minutes. One night I wanted to finish a puzzle I already started, it was around 11.30pm, when I checked again the time thinking I could maybe stay a bit longer, it was 2.30am! I strongly recommend to anyone that has a quest to get this because you won't regret it, its my daily app to relax while I'm stressed. Congrats to Daniel for his amazing work and continue expanding this amazing little gem.","Every time I finish a set of puzzles, I literally get withdrawal symptoms waiting for the next set to become available !!!! I really wish the amount of puzzle pieces could be increased from 400 to 600 or even higher, so it would take me longer to do them and I wouldn’t then be pacing the floor for so many day’s in anticipation for the he next set !!!! Absolutely fantastic and worth every penny. A big well done and a huge thank you to whoever developed this game .","This game is one of my 'go to' games. I love the new puzzles each month. I subscribe to the puzzle packs so I don't miss any. The church ones with interior sections are my favorite . After I finish it , i'll sit inside the church and listen to the nature sounds/ street noise going on outside . Very relaxing game . It's definitely worth the app purchase if you enjoy puzzles , especially 3D puzzles ."
