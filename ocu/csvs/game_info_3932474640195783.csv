With some really frustrating problems. Frustrating enough to not buy the game. The hit detection on the enemies you can jump on is sometimes horrible. Especially the flying one. ADD CHECKPOINTS GEEZUS. Dying in this game is commun. Due to the game itself. And yeah... It's frustrating yet a little more when you're so close. So 1 checkpoint by level would be so sweet. When dashing , jumping is not always responsive. Solution ? Allow the player to jump once while falling. Falling to my death while I had the jump button pressed ... Frustrating +1. I really loved the game when there was no problems. But there was one every 20 seconds. The level with the ninjas is satisfying when you correctly do the jumps... Until the game decide to forget you pressed the button. So yeah... It's a potential 8/10 , but -5 for repetitive frustration. Edit : +1 star for positive response."
