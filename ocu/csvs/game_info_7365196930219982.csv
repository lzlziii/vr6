This is by far the superior builder on Quest2. At first I was a bit like it's ok but now I've played for a good while this game is brilliant and gets better as it goes on, especially the story mode. Good voice overs and story plot and tbf the graphics and scale are decent too. Extremely in depth game with ALOT to research, unlock and build. Also theres combat/military aspects in this game that I didnt even expect which is cool too, slight command and conquer feel in places. Easy to play and follow the tutorials. But if you forget any info it's all in the knowledge base which is handy for reference. The story makes you take choices also which actually affect the game. If you want to get stuck into a mars terraforming resource manager building game this is for you. I get lost for a couple hours at a time with this title and currently it's the only game I'm playing out of 40 titles I own in my Quest 2. Really surprising title and a must have. A pleasant break from all the generic FPS games on here. A++","Have only been playing a few days and know I‚Äôve barely scratched the surface. Can‚Äôt put it down and really excited to see how the story develops. I like resource management games but have never played one with this level of complexity. I‚Äôm super attached to my little world I‚Äôve built. Note that it crashes on startup sometimes. Anyway, I love it and it‚Äôs just what the Quest needed. UPDATE: **Possible spoilers** Now that I‚Äôve played through the game once fully and am partway through a second run on ‚Äúper aspera‚Äù mode, I thought I‚Äôd update my review. First of all the crashing only happened a handful of times in the beginning, and seems to have stopped. I find it so entirely addictive and I end up losing hours. There is so much information to learn along the way, and so much strategizing to do, and it‚Äôs a real challenge, which draws me in. The voice acting is excellent. I even get a bit creeped out at times. Super immersive. This is definitely my kind of thing. Few things I would suggest: - The loading time is quite long (not sure if that can be improved). - Small inconsistency: The font for the organic material dumpster in the construction menu is bigger than the rest. - I like that the game doesn‚Äôt hold your hand all the way through and there are a lot of things you have to figure out for yourself by experimenting or reading the database, but it seems to be a rather polarizing feature as some people need more support. For example: - Combat isn‚Äôt super intuitive, and the built in tutorial doesn‚Äôt make it very clear. I had to do some internet research and trouble-shooting before actually feeling in control of my drones. (Hint to others, you have to click the bubble with the number to select a group of drones, not the hive they are on. After giving them a place to go, you have to deselect your group by pressing B before you can select another group. Re-combine split up groups the same way you direct them to other places ‚Äî you just need to be very precise when clicking the number bubbles.) - I would love an ‚Äúall drones return to base‚Äù option that also re-combines split groups. - And maybe changing the colour of the number bubble when you hover over it (rather than just a slight change in the shade of blue) would help people notice it ‚Äî Quest‚Äôs resolution doesn‚Äôt show it very clearly. - Some of the buildings could use a bit more info in the description, like indicating what you should be seeing if it‚Äôs placed correctly and working (eg. one person said they couldn‚Äôt figure out what the aqua-dome does, and it took me a while to notice the effects too). All that said, it‚Äôs still a 5-star game in my opinion, definitely worth the reasonable price.",Had high hope for this one. I love simcities and such but this one. Just Bof I played like 10=20 hours. Got the Terraformer 4 award and the immortal award and many more. But i still don't know what an AquaDome really does. The voice acting is great specially from Amy. The story is nice but does it have an ending ? I need to bring down the planet temperature but how ? Or is that it when you beat Carmine ? Yep just Bof,"Literally everything about this game is good. The gameplay, the decision making (and that it actually matters) the graphics, and the story. All of it is just perfection. Honestly i loved the story, it's a real ""choose your own adventure"" kinda vibe with the different endings. I hope they make a sequel. That would be cool. üëç",Hello developers i think ther is a bug so yesterday i was playing per aspera then all off a suden i start losing nitrogen and oxigen fast but i dont have any oxgen suckers so please reply to my comment hello i am back this time it is whit asteroids year 10 i unlocked aurobreaking methane asteroid year 100 havent goten a single one since year 10 and ami said that you can get carbon from aurobreaking and on stage 5 i need to get carbon below 5 but after that i goes to zero and i cant see plant life like trees and grass look i know this game is new but please don't be like cities vr when i zume out the buildings turns to mush please fix these problems. Hello developers so when you teraform mars what do you think probably making ot breathable Bet i think making it green when you run out off co2 what do you do you can use carbon extracter to release corbon into the air but that doesn't last ither let me introduce to you green house gases it will be easy to get but it takes longer for the leachen to spread and forest like carbon but a sub subsatute because I am tired of when I run out of carbon I don't get to see forest grow or even animals in fact I never saw a single tree or a animal in my game and I played three times but nothing and also the water stops spreading at around 2000 meters I know this game just released but you can't change the controls to oculus and then slap on the price and say pay up you have to put effort in it and I don't mean to offend you guys but I have faith and I will help with reporting bugs and giving ideas but please just keep putting effort and also I know that this game is realistic but when the grass spread does it also consume carbon or just the green house please let me know Hello I am back could you please add trees and bird I thought that green mars was that tipe of 2.00 update I finally found why I lose so much carbon during stage 4 you see that the aqua dome bacteria can keep spreading so my idea is that you can add barriers and it will give you a percent on how much carbon it consumes and you much oxigen it makes and a nother idea I have why don't you add water domes that make carbon from oxigen and it will have the same features as the regular water dome and barriers it's all about balance so please consider my idea and make it free so everyone can make the big red planet there home. Hello in the tech tree can you add carbon asteroid aerobreking please And could you please post your updates on the oculus store please
