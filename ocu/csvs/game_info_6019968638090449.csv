VRNOID,"Your goal is to destroy all bricks and enemies. Collect dropped power-ups but make sure not to miss a ball. Swing your hand to hit the ball just like in Air Hockey. Enemies are trying to shoot your VR head, which takes the challenge to a new level. Dodge bullets or reflect them into the enemy. Features: Advanced boss fights: Some bosses are weak at the back, others can't be hit by the ball, etc. Each boss requires a unique approach to defeat it. In-game level editor Try out your ideas. Full VR, no need to leave the game or use a mouse. Air Hockey: additional game mode with few setups and exciting power-ups. Flexible difficulty: 8 gameplay modifiers and 5 game difficulties are available. Play in your own style. Quick room setup: mega easy to calibrate room. Just hold one button to set direction and table height.

Just buy it. Criminal this isn't in the oculus offical store. Tons of levels and varying difficulty will keep you coming back again and again...,"I'm a sucker for breakout games and everyone loves air hockey, so when I was made aware of the demo for this a few weeks ago, I downloaded immediately. It doesn't disappoint. It's a lot of fun. Both modes (breakout and air hockey) are great, and I can only imagine how much fun the air hockey mode will be once the multiplayer comes live. There is even a level editor for you to create levels and share! (I presume everyone can play your created levels?!) If I had to give one criticism, I would say the ball physics could be better. The ball physics doesn't feel natural. You can tell the ball has been programmed to only go in certain directions, so this immediately removes the realism. If the ball was free to go anywhere realistically, then this would be absolutely amazing, but I feel the developers will be unable to do this. Still, the ball can go in loads of different directions, so it's not all bad. As soon as the game got officially released I didn't think twice and purchased immediately. I will be uploading my gameplay video to my Facebook group called ""Ridoculus - Oculus / Meta Quest Gaming"" Highly recommended.","Look, the game is simple and you’ll get the idea of the game from looking at the pictures and the trailer. The game dev takes a very simple arcade-style retro game with high-quality production. The game is much harder than you think. I went through the campaign at the amateur level (Second from the bottom) and I definitely struggled during the boss rights. During the boss fights, you’ll have to focus on the ball so it doesn’t leave the boundary while dodging the boss turrets. If I struggled in amateur, I don’t even want to think about the 3 higher difficulty levels available. This is where most of your replayability comes in because if you can’t beat a boss level, you’ll be spending a lot of time starting up again, which brings in the challenge as well. Air hockey mode is somewhat fun but it got a little repetitive playing against an AI so the main fun of the game was held in the campaign. I haven’t tried the SteamVR version but my understanding is that you get to play multiplayer(?), that feature would be amazing to get a cross play going between two standalone or standalone/PCVR. Once that update becomes live, the air hockey game mode would be a blast as well! You definitely see a lot of arcade-style games through App Lab, but this game is better in terms of gameplay and design than the majority of the games I’ve seen or played. Looking forward to the multiplayer update!","VRNOID takes me back to the days when I used to sit in front of a TV and play Space Invaders on the Atari 2600. It features traditional brick breaking levels where you must break all bricks to clear a level. Additionally, it puts and exciting spin on the game with the combination of air hockey, power ups and enemies that add an extra challenge to levels as you dodge and weave your way through oncoming bullets and even deflect them back for extra damage! You can get quite a good workout playing this game! VRNOID features a decent amount of levels in the action packed campaign and sprinkles in some calmer levels to teach you about new mechanics or powerups along the way. There is even an intuitive level editor that allows you to create your own levels and and stages using the bricks and powerups you unlock along the way. I've had a lot of fun completing the campaign so far, and keep wanting to come back to try new modifiers and place higher on the leaderboard.","Simplistic but effective graphics, great music, and makes me sweat. Wish there was an option to switch hands occasionally (like in Racket NX) and the leaderboard doesn't show any names for me. Still worth a purchase."
