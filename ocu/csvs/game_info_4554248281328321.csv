I love the art style, the story line and just everything about this game! It is absolutely worth the money, I spent hours upon hours playing this game and enjoyed every second of it. Thank you so much for this game, I haven't been able to find a game that I enjoy as much as this one, I was so upset when I finished it!","Https://25.bio.link Feel free to use for twenty five off The developer has some of the best quest games, I’ve bought their previous titles and each get better and better. The game has an great story line and unique gameplay, the learning curve is very low allowing anyone to jump in.","It's very obvious that Owlchemy makes an effort to improve with each game, and this is no exception. Honestly, it took me awhile to buy this game because it seemed too cute and for children, but I should have known that the humor that can be appreciated by adults in their previous titles was also in this one. Like vacation simulator, you can freely explore the world and choose which tasks to complete to finish the main storyline. Being a completionist, I finished all of them. The Chem lab and astrology lab were my favorites and would have loved to do more tasks in those (maybe because I used to be a scientist ;-)). Unlike vacation simulator, the cafe orders were much simpler (in my VS review my only complaint was they were to complicated), but maybe a little too simple since I got a lot of cook's choice orders. I was hoping for a couple of more complicated orders with more ingredients. This was one title that I was sad when I completed everything because I would have loved to stay in this world longer! Hoping for a sequel!","Am I the only one having problems lately with the game glitching? Lately, it seems that whenever I play it would keep flickering and I cant get it to stop and its annoying. I look one way and then it glitch to another area . I love love love how interacting this game it and everything about it. I just hope someone can help me with this glitch when I play grrr!!!","I think my 7 year old likes playing this on our 2nd Quest more than I do. He loves it so much that he has restarted and is on his 2nd time playing it. I solved it 100% too, loved it and I'm over 50 so it's great for all ages. Just buy it!"
