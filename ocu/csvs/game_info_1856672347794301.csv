In the debug section of settings at the very bottom theres an option to delete cache(in vrchat settings), once u delete restart game and that should fix logging in problems or loading other worlds. If restarting cache doesn't work then I have no clue what's wrong.","So, as we all know, our games have been crashing and telling us that we “don’t have enough memory”. I don’t know what’s going on with vrchat, I like these updates, but we need them to stop. I liked vrchat back when we just got the physics update. No crashing, no freezing, etc. But anyways, to the resolving part. How I fixed my issue with vrchat was by buying a new oculus. Another temporary way you can fix this; go to settings, storage, and delete your data on vrchat. Uninstalling won’t help you. Or you could just never play vrc again— Hope this helps!!","I love vrchat been playing it for years the one place I’m able to get away and meet new ppl and have the most fun but I keep running into the problem of it not being able to get passed the first loading screen I’ve done everything I’ve seen on what to do abt it resetting my headset uninstalling and reinstalling it, I even did a hard reset on my headset ( made it to where it’s a whole new quest 2) the game still didn’t work, please fix your game Vrchat I’ve been deal with this issue for the past 3 days!!","So ever since the last two updates I have been crashing repeatedly, I'll either load into my homeworld and crash within a few minutes or I'll try to join another world and it'll crash me right away I've uninstalled and reinstalled my game and even rebooted my headset entirely just to see if it would work and nothing's changed hopefully there's a way to fix this.","I, along with countless others are suddenly experiencing a problem where you load in and it crashes immediately. This is a wide spread issue and for what I know the developers are not taking much notice for. They will eventually lose most of the playerbase if it is not resolved, this issue should be a number one priority for the devs and must be fixed soon."
