Fit Immersion,"Fit Immersion transforms your cardio sessions in an immersive and interactive experience. Our goal is to simulate an outdoor ride from your stationary bike. You can discover touristic and cyclist tracks mostly filmed in 360° in different countries or made in 3D. To make it more realistic the app synchronizes movement speed with pedaling frequency and even difficulty if you have a compatible smart trainer (BLE FTMS). Tested some tracks and convinced? Then grab some credits and download tracks of your choice. Note: The app iscapable to communicate with Bluetooth cadence sensors, smart bikes and pedals in official version since v1.4 (needs Oculus v37 update).",3+,Single User,Gamepad,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","360 Experience (non-game), Sports, Travel","English, French (France), Russian",4.8,PERFORM VR,PERFORM VR,https://fitimmersion.com/,"Nov 10, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3843407212446251/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3843407212446251&r=1, https://fitimmersion.com/privacy-policy/?v=0f177369a3b7",175.5 MB,"First off, I don't have the sensors or a smart bike, so I can't speak to that aspect of this app. All I have is a stationary bike. But I really appreciate how the app will just play a fully 360 degree video of a location as I pedal, moving me along at a smooth pace. It does help me feel immersed in the environment, which is far more enjoyable than staring at my wall, or just watching a TV show or something. So kudos to Fit Immersion for that. The video resolution isn't the best, so, while it does feel like I'm there, it also feels like I need glasses or something. A crisp, clean video would be awesome. The price for credits seems a little steep. One course (without sound) is 90 credits, which costs just shy of $10USD. There are several courses available, but if you want variety, it's going to cost quite a bit. I'm not likely to buy very many, if any, more courses at that price. Finally, the menu in the app is clunky and doesn't have any kind of login option. So you create an account on the Fit Immersion website and buy credits from there, but then there's no login feature in the app to get to your credits. I had to contact customer service via chat on their website to have them add the credits to my app. So that whole process could use some work, as well as the website itself, which doesn't have any links at all to the page where you buy credits. I could only get there by having the app send me an email with a link to it. Overall, I think this is a good app for adding some environment and enjoyment to your at-home ride.","This app has great potential to be really good. I’ve tried the other two paid cycling apps, but I wasn’t really a fan of them, so when I saw this app, I was really excited. The idea of cycling and being immersed in real places seemed fun. When I originally downloaded the app, it was extremely glitchy and I could never get the app to recognize my cadence sensor. After some back-and-forth conversations with the developers, they pushed out a new update and now it works a lot more smoother! I would rate the app much higher, but the quality of the video tracks could be a lot better, and although that’s no fault of the developers (360 videos don’t seem to look that great on the Quest), I think using 180 videos, instead of 360, might make the experience much better—at least for the time being. Overall, I’m glad to have an alternative fitness app.","Was looking forward to use this app, but i got dissaponited when i couldn't get it working. It finds my cad sensor and i can only download the demo which doesn't work. Tried to buy credits to download another map which also doesn't work. I get to the page were it requires my details then it is stop. As the detail page is all in french which i don't understand it seems to complicated to get any use for the app.","Couldn’t find my cadence sensor, couldn’t enter my email to buy credits, demo was inoperative. Complete dud. I know it’s in app lab but come on! I’ll change my rating if the developers get their act together.","I give 5 starts because for the moment is free, but i have some problems, that if dissapears, maybe I will pay for a complete app. First, I cant fix the HUD, all the data is on the edge and I cant see the data clear and doesnt exist an option to move it. Second, I've download the ""Under the bridge"" circuit and after 8 seconds, the track hangs or freeze. If you close and open it again, start to works but no data (speed, distance,...) I hope they fix it in a future upgrade. I cant do home bike without it :)"
