Art Gate VR,"Art Gate is on a mission to make the arts more accessible. Launched in 2018, it offers customizable gallery spaces for exhibitions taking place in a fully interactive, social virtual reality (VR) art market. Art Gate presents a new way for artists, aficionados, galleries, dealers, and collectors to discover, buy, and sell art internationally; through a VR headset or simply with their computer (PC/Mac). Regardless of physical location, art can be shared with visitors around the world, who can meet up together in the virtual environment. - Join art events - Curate exhibitions - Connect with artists, collectors, and galleries from all over the world For our programming schedule visit: www.artgatevr.com/programming",12+,"Multiplayer, Single User","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Touch (as Gamepad)","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Entertainment,Education,English,1.4.0,Art Gate VR Inc.,Art Gate VR Inc.,https://www.artgatevr.com/,"Mar 18, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3696702890397028/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3696702890397028&r=1, https://artgatevr.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,371.7 MB,In the last year I've been to dozens of art openings at galleries from around the world through this app. It is my favorite way to connect with art dealers and find new artworks to collect. Well done! Definately give it a try if you want to meet new art friends from around the world and collect some art. I even found some Andy Warhols in there! 10/10,i really think this app has a lot of potential but teleportation ruins the experience for me. i understand its great for those with motion sickness but there should be an option for free movement. that feels realistic. bugs: - left rotation doesnt work - entering certain galleries hangs,"i love it so much. The exhibition was as real as it was real,beautiful，but the demo version just has some issues when i wanna visit another art exhibition，it suddenlly frozen,no button can work","I discovered Art Gate in 2018 and saw the platform growing into an amazing marketplace in VR for post-modern and contemporary art. I love seeing art dealers using technology to help make the art world more accessible. Every time I do a gallery hop in Art Gate, there are new exhibitions and new art galleries to discover!","good be something i really like. got stuck within minutes. screen prompting me to press A on controller. have waited a while, nothing happens. The second try, jumping to a next spot suddenly not available anymore! How? What?"
