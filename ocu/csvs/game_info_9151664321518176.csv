If that doesn‚Äôt make sense, then it will when you play it. But there are moments which are so surreal and fantastically horrific yet resonate with something terrifyingly true about humanity which made me stop in my tracks. It is the kind of game that makes you confront hard truths in a terrifying way, yet a way that remains meaningful. I got the game for free in a giveaway, and am so glad I did because it was quite the experience and I do recommend it. I‚Äôm debating seeing if the game has multiple endings or not. The game plays a bit like a horrific Firewatch or point and click narrative adventure, but there are forks in various paths. From the ones I tried, I didn‚Äôt see much difference in the paths but I can‚Äôt help but wonder if the story would have changed if I hadn‚Äôt followed the ‚Ä¶ obvious way. I hope that‚Äôs true, because even though the game doesn‚Äôt really need replays likey since it is so strong narratively, being able to change theur one might be cathartic. Overall it was great. Some of the hand gestures were a bit wonky, but I still recommend giving them a go. Certain actions just hit me differently because I was doing them with my own hands.",What an amazing horror based vr puzzler! Pushes the boundaries of this genre! Full hand tracking amazing feature! Can‚Äôt recommend this game enough! If your a fan of horror it‚Äôs for you! Also if your a little squeamish I also think you could play this as it‚Äôs just on the edge üòÖ Can‚Äôt wait to get further into this game!! But so far so good! Loving the story line üî•,"There is so much great voice acting and story here. I loved the environment design, the attention to details on the sets, and the pacing of the story. I felt like I was the star in my own personal horror movie! It starts out a bit slow and gets so good as it goes (like any great horror movie). I highly recommend you come into this game prepared to play it with hand tracking. There are so many moments that are made better by the hand tracking mode! This is the first time I‚Äôve seen it used to such great effect. I am a fan of ‚Äúwalking simulator‚Äù style games with heavy story and minimal gameplay. This game has a few mild puzzles, but nothing annoying. Just enough to give you a quick ‚Äúah ha!‚Äù moment and move on. I hope Meta choose to add this one to the main store so more people will see it. It feels like a waste that it‚Äôs on app lab where less people will discover it. I‚Äôm biased because it‚Äôs exactly what I wanted, but I am certain there are others out there that have been waiting for something like this. I really like that the developers don‚Äôt crank up jump scares. There are SLIGHT startle moments but all but the biggest chickens will be able to complete this no problem. The horror here is more existential. I wish more horror devs would take notes on this game, because jump scares in VR are hard for me to handle, and I‚Äôm a die hard horror fan. Speaking of existential horror, the ending hit different. It will leave you thinking about it afterwards, and possibly not in a good way. I like it! Despite me giving 5 stars, I have a few issues with the game that I wanted to mention. Sometimes the line delivery changes tone. Like for example our protagonist might be extremely panicked, then a second later you teleport and she is completely fine. Obviously the devs can‚Äôt control how long you wait between those nodes, so I won‚Äôt knock them for that too much. HOWEVER, I will complain a bit that a lot of my favorite moments are in the trailer. Like the bit with the snake, or the saw, etc. I get it though, you gotta sell copies and show the cool stuff. My last complaint is sometimes the story would outright tell me things that were obvious. I felt like the writers were afraid the user wouldn‚Äôt pick up the information, so they spell it out. I knock that in films sometimes too so I gotta mention it here. I wanted to finish this review by saying PLEASE immediately make something else like this. VR desperately needs more Firewatch-style walking simulators. Thanks for making this! PS: release this on Steam too you cowards! ;) I wanna buy it again and play it at higher resolution.","I got this game for free from a giveaway and I probably wouldn‚Äôt have really been interested in it otherwise but I‚Äôm glad I did because this is an amazing game. Amazing atmosphere, Great art style, beautiful music, interesting story, fun gameplay all for a really low price 10/10, I recommend this game completely","This is a story driven game which uses hand gestures. There's no jump scares or genuinely scary moments, just an overall feeling of upcoming dread. I haven't played this type of game before but won it in a competition. I found it engaging and played it a little over 3 days until I completed it. The production levels are high and there are puzzles which drive the story which are not too difficult. At one point I did find myself aimlessly moving around the woods trying to find where I should be going but generally everything is linear driven. The hand controls are fun but sometimes fiddly until you get the nack of them. Along the way there are ""memories"" that appear in the air that replay when you touch them. This was a nice touch giving context and background to the story. I must confess to not fully understanding the ending! If you like story driven games I would recommend this. Like many other players have mentioned, it is a quality game with good acting and a supernatural story line."
