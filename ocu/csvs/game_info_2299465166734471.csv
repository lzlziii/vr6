Epic Roller Coasters,"In Epic Roller Coasters you'll get the same feeling of real roller coasters in places and situations that probably you will never have in the real life! There are so many possibilities: magic, world of dinosaurs, haunted houses and so many others! You'll find three different modes: - Classic is where you, your family and friends can take a clasic roller coaster ride. - Shooter mode is the perfect combination of two amazing universes! Roller coasters and shooting! - Race mode: take the control of the cart on your own time or fast as possible challenging your friends for the best score! Each roller coaster comes with a new cart and weapon. Don't forget to call your friends to ride your favorites roller coasters with you. You can also compete to discover who will ride the roller coaster faster or collaborate in the shooter mode to hit as much targets as you can.

GIVE ME A REFUND or stick by you word free updates for ever COME OCULUS SORT THIS SOFTWARE OUT.,"After paying for full access in the game, it updates, and now I have to pay for the new coasters? Why offer unlimited access for a set amount and then ask for more money to continue to use new coasters? And Oculus support won't do a thing about it as far as help goes getting a refund or a resolution. *** After speaking with the developer, they have made it clear that even though you paid for unlimited access to their product. It doesn't count for additional roller-coasters. You still have to pay $1.99 for each additional one. Despite being told for a 1 time charge, you'll unlock unlimited access to all the coasters. So beware. You can read something and think its one way and they'll tell you it isn't and you're S.O.L. Personally I don't want to do business with a company thats shady. Mean what you say and say what you mean. Don't be ripping people off because you said one thing but meant something else. Im asking meta for a refund. I'd rather play something where I get exactly what I pay for. And dont have to pay everytime something updates.",This game is great! I love how the game is free and comes with tracks that you do not have to buy! I feel like you have to have someone to play it with though to have the best experience. My favorite mode is shooter and my favorite track is the Dinosaur one! Keep continuing making a great game!!!! THX SO MUCH!!!!!,"Same story as everyone else. Bought the complete pack to get everything, only to have the tracks I had previously bought to be TAKEN AWAY FROM ME…. And placed behind a paywall! The devs are basically saying “oh you paid for this? Well if you want to use it you need to pay again…”. Pretty much boils down to extortion of the player base. That isn’t the only problem, they update the existing tracks very rarely with minor changes, even more rarely they may completely overhaul a particular track. But once you have ridden each track a couple of times, they get boring, even the shooter and race modes are just the same thing again and again. The game quickly puts itself as one of those “if I’m bored enough” or “just updated let’s see what’s changed” kind of games, meaning you only pick it up every now and again if you can find the effort, only to quickly put it down again to be forgotten about until the next “I’m bored with nothing else to do” or next update. Unless you’re a die hard coaster fan this is the kind of game you might pick up and play for one hour every month just to see if the latest 1gb+ update actually changed anything noticeable (spoiler- usually not very much). Plus you can find pretty good videos on YouTube of what the updates and new tracks are, so I’d recommend you have a look on YouTube for the latest updates/tracks to see if it’s actually worth you paying for them.",Why am I still asked to pay when I've already purchased the full version? This is easily one of the worst/most boring games in VR and yet they do nothing but ask for MORE money. I should not have to pay for extra DLCs after purchasing the FULL game. Do everyone a favor and flag the app because this is a SCAM.
