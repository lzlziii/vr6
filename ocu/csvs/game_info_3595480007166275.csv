Verto Studio VR,"VertoStudio VR is a fully-capable 3D modeling studio designed to run entirely in VR! You can use it to import FBX, OBJ, DAE (and more) directly in front of you, then configure every aspect of the visual display of these scenes directly down to the individual polygons. Whether you are mocking up a quick VR workflow, or designing production VR environments, this tool eliminates all of the pipeline complexity involved with getting 3D assets and content into VR quickly. Using Verto Studio, there is no more guesswork in designing for VR.

Was happy to see that they were easy to import, at least in OBJ format (everything, not just the mesh). Very straightforward interface! Demo scenes often fail to download but eventually they do. Nice rendering (and quite a few options too)! Very little lag. Great support through an extensive online doc. All in all a great yet simple app that delivers! Well worth the one-time payment.","In the 1990s a talented coder created a software application called Anim8or. Still there when I looked. Still excellent too. This afforded high end modelling techniques to amateurs and gave you an excellent grounding in the language, methodologies and techniques used by professionals. You could then take your rendered models into an in-app film studio and animate fly-bys and other complex motions. It gave you a chance to emulate the big-guns current in the CGI universe at the time. This gem of an app does exactly the same and in a VR environment. It encourages exploration , trial and error and practice. There is solid ground work for beginners in here. A really excellent place to start to explore the craft and imagination of Subdivisional Node Based Polygonal Modelling and more. It’s a skill and tricky stuff to master but to have an app of this quality to “cut your chops” on is great. It’s like being back in 1999 but in 2022 . Exciting times. An animation studio plug-in would be welcome as would more varied in-built textures. Check out , online , the Ani8or galleries of models for inspiration. Also check out Arkio in App Lab. They are also moving this type of work forward in exciting ways. This is how the next generation of superstars get started. Fab!"
