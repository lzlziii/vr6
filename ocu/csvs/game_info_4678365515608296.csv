I could always look online for how to play but it would be better to be able to read the rules in game. It might be an idea to include (or even default to) a mode where the bunny girls are more appropriately dressed for non adult audience as the current attire may limit your market a little. Perhaps adding hand tracking at some stage. Well done and hopefully the game evolves a little over time","Why aren't there more ratings on here?? This is Awesome, Multi-player and Free!! A lil twist to black Jack!",.,"Horribly glitchy and buggy. It is only ok if there were no glitches too. This game is nothing special.
