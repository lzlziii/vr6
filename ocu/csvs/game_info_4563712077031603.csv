Curatours,"Museum of Plastic 2121 is the first museum tour available on Curatours! Built 100 years from now in an imagined future where things have worked out well for both the planet and humanity. Visitors can uncover the story of plastic - its history, science, industry, and impact on our environment. They will learn the importance of establishing a circular economy and find out how activism and individual action happening now will lead to positive change in the future. Every Thursday in November 2021 we will be opening a new wing of the Museum of Plastic. Curatours is a social virtual tour platform for culture and heritage. Visit incredible places filled with art, artefacts, stories and friends. Visitors can access tours of museums around the world from desktop, phones or VR headsets. In VR it's an incredibly immersive experience and on other devices it feels like a cross between a video call and playing a multiplayer game.",12+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity, Documentary & History, Educational",English,1.1.7390,Cooperative Innovations,Cooperative Innovations,https://cura.tours/,"Nov 8, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4563712077031603/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4563712077031603&r=1, https://www.coopinnovations.co.uk/privacy/",1.67 GB,Great worlds so far. Snowball additional is the icing on the cake.,"You walk around a small VR museum about plastic. It is well presented by a clear and sexy British female voice. I enjoyed it and learned. And it is free. I was surprised it didn't mention the company ""the ocean cleanup"". On the negative side, there is a small bug that didn't run anything on the 6th video on the industry side. I also wished the voice will turn on automatically when you get close to the spot. Finally I hope you could show us the molecules in VR, maybe more art and recommended books on this subject, and map where each paintings are located and where the garbage is sent, which country pollute more, the air quality, etc .. The presentation is better than Anne frank house VR, and plundering the beginning of a genocide.","I get that this is the first iteration but from a technical point of view this is very rough around the edges. Controls are buggy, narration is buggy and confusing and the UI frequently fails. On top of that there's a lot of comfort issues that make for a nauseating experience like touching something with your head will push back the whole world. The first plastic museum is pretty unfocused from a storytelling perspective too. Plastic bad we understand but it muddles and mixes discourses about climate and plastic without making a good point for either.",My friend and I both downloaded this so we could walk through the museum together. But the “Friends” tab is grayed out. How do I send an invite in game to my friend? Thanks so much!
