But it's not a free service... At least not without the incessant emails about purchasing a subscription. I used it for less then a half an hour and removed the trial to see how they deal with someone just using it without a pro subscription. And I deleted my account right off the bat... Apparently its 750 for ""boost"" or 1500 ""for business ... Waaay too much. I'm not going to add a card for the popup to stop bugging me. The 3 stars are for the nice look and feel as well as the nice integrations it has. If I had more blender assets under my belt I would probably use this cause it's cool, if it weren't for the subscription based usesage.... If the free plan was not so insistent on bugging me every time I made a new project I would give it a 4 star... Us poor folk shouldn't need to be bugged about puting a card on an account. Some of us choose not to so we don't accidentally charged something we can't afford....",The potential of this platform is limited only by your own imagination.,It's the best app actually to create interactive AR/VR project on the market ! + Easy to use (import my assets from Sketchfab / Dropbox) + No code,only two options $100 per month or $500 per month? I can't afford either ðŸ˜ª
