Skygaze (Demo),"SKYGAZE transforms your home into a magical planetarium, letting you explore the night sky in breath-taking detail. The app features accurate star positions calculated in real time, as well as the visible planets in our solar system. This project was awarded 3rd Place at the Meta XR Hackathon 2021. The prize money was used to develop this demo.

Getting location error so the sky is wrong for me though.,"This is a great app. I enjoy looking at the night sky from within my home. It’s pretty cool. One suggested though. It would be cool to look at different skies from different planets. Instead of making that too complicated, it would just be a day and night sky for all the planets in the solar system. Including things like a sunset on mars. Or an earthrise on the moon. That would be a cool feature",I want to unlock the geolocation ..is it not done?,"It's a very good tool, but I would like to suggest improvements. ・The sky is too bright. It would be nice to be able to adjust the darkness of the sky. ・There is no need for daytime expressions. It would be nice to be able to turn on/off the dayltime. ・It would be nice to be able to advance or return the current time with the stick. ・It would be nice if there was a mode where there is no text display at all.",Mr devs I NEEEEEEED the full game plsss I want all the locked stuff soo bad
