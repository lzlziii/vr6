Space Walk,"The Aalto Virtual Planetarium is a tour of the inner Solar System, with the grand structures of planetary magnetospheres show through the eyes of a space physicist. Aimed at education and outreach, the immersive virtual reality experience demonstrates Aalto space research, including the plasma physics of the Sun, magnetosphere of inner planets, the Finland100 satellite and cometary environments. Complex structures and spatial scales of magnetospheric physics are intuitively presented, with plans for research tools of 3D simulation data based on the system.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Documentary & History, Educational, Space/Universe",English,0.8,Aalto University Finland,Aalto University Finland,https://space.aalto.fi/software/,"Aug 26, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4216204338434548/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4216204338434548&r=1, https://space.aalto.fi/software/",302.7 MB,"It is good, well presented, but has major flaws: - When you start the app, you start at a bird view. That's awesome. But you cannot get back to that view - there are a lot of planets without any info: Moon, Saturn, Nepture, Jupiter, etc... - I like to see tables comparing planets temperature, gravity, day duration, etc... - Please add timeline of special events (e.g. when did we walk on the moon) - We can see the stars but I could not find the north star - it is impossible to click on a planet if it is blocked by the one you are looking at.",Controls horrible and game just feels terrible to play. Give it a while for any further development before installing,"Not all the plannets are clickable. Controll is very bad. Cannot zoom in/out of a planet, and cannot orbit it. Cannot turn it around, cannot do anything. I wouldn't say this app is in alpha stage. Not even pre-alpha. Full of bugs. Why selling it now. Wait untill it is more mature."
