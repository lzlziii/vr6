Coming Out Simulator,"You Are Loved. You Are Awesome. You Are You. You Never Have To Hide That. The Coming Out Simulator is a positive experience for those who feel closeted or confused about coming out to their loved ones about being gay. I am a father of 4 children. My daughter came out to my wife and I and I remember how hard she struggled and the doubt and fear she imagined in her mind about what would happen if she told us. When she did, we immediately told her that that was great. We reminded her that she never had to be afraid to be herself around us. We told her how awesome she is and how much we love her. Nothing would ever change that. I built the Coming Out Simulator because I know that my daughters story is not always the case. Some coming out stories are scary, sad, lonely...They are all different. I wanted to create a happy place to celebrate you.
