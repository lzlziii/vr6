The flick function never worked for me honestly, as another reviewed wrote. I tried to flick and rotate the steel crates and all they did was fling past me, hit the edge of the ship, then go off into space. I did also have one steel crate glitch and just stuck to the border of the ship entrance and rattle annoyingly for the rest of the time limit. No matter what I did to grab or move it, wouldn't budge and just sat and rattled. But a super simple and fun game honestly and I enjoyed this demo!",The shooting is alright. The guns all feel the same and mainly do the exact same. The gravity is where the game is really lacking. Overall a fun experience,This was my first VR game experience and I really enjoyed it! I loved the vending machine in space :),"Simple concept, executed well. I was right on the edge about buying the additional levels for $2 after finishing the free demo. For me, there were a few minor things that kept me from pulling the trigger on a purchase: 1) The ""flick"" action for the magne-gun felt pretty unresponsive, even with two hands. It wasn't clear if it's intended to be that way or I was doing it wrong. Some sort of visual demonstration would have really helped there. 2) The semi-automatic guns required way too many trigger presses in a short time. My index finger started cramping by the end of even the shorter levels. The full-auto guns worked great, and I wish all guns had that enabled. 3) It was a bit unclear where on the sides were the ""sweet spots"" that pulled items into the bay. Some sort of vague visual indicator showing how far up to my sides the traction enabled would have made it a lot easier to tell where I needed to aim junk. Bravo to the developer on this one though! The aiming and physics felt solid."
