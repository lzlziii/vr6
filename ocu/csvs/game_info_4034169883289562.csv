The physics are spot on none of that guided automated crap. Me and buds always get a few rounds of cricket in and have a blast. Can't wait for the quest store release. Looking forward to the future updates. Solid developer.,A load of rubbish no hand tracking,"Even if this game is still under development, it is the best dart game for the Quest 2. The other games have either non realistic gameplay or really really bad physics. I've never played a multiplayer match but for me the single player modes are really worth the money.","I bought both dart games today (for my oculus quest two) and this one is 100 times better than the other childish game forever VR darts. ￼ after playing both, ￼ I can't even begin to want to play the crappy one plus I just asked for a refund on forever VR darts. It just seems like those games are bloated with fancy graphics, but simplistic and chaotic and crappy gameplay. ￼ on target, VR darts really impresses me .",Tried to use this app and it wouldn’t launch.
