It’s also fun to play along with the song book… to see if I can hit the notes on time and in tune when they appear. I especially like the wide range of settings available to change the sound. Mesmerizing!","￼ Nocturne ￼ is an excellent and unique virtual instrument. It’s extremely flexible, very fun and creates an environment that feels very meditative to me. Can’t wait to see what Outpost4 does with it.￼",I have a (real) theremin and enjoy playing it – but it is hard. I was impressed and pleasantly surprised how rewarding it was to play this VR instrument. I might even record myself playing and then see if I can play along with my theremin later on! Well done.,"This is a fun and well polished VR musical instrument. It has lots of potential (including new sounds/instruments). It's a more intuitive theremin, you improved the theremin. Love it.",>Want 25% off?
