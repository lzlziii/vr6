They provide tons of free contents, and in high quality as well. Right now, their only paid content is the Dreamcatcher concert like experience (which I happily purchased as you can download the 8k performances). The other contents are from the kpop music show 'The Show' where they add 2-3 groups per week. (currently nugus or non mainstream/famous groups, but it has been a delight since many of themm are underrated). But i hope Venta X will grow even bigger and more will download and get to experience these shows and in stunning 8k. So they will be able to invite even the most famous groups in the future. Cheers to Venta X.","I don't know how many times I've seen this concert. I had an amazing experience where my favorite member made eye contact with me and danced. It felt like I was a camera director on stage. I was very dizzy when I watched a similar VR video before, but I lost track of time because there was no dizziness and the screen change was fun. Best content to buy and watch VR. I'm looking forward to other concert videos!","The only broadcast studio level video for VR! No matter how you interested in K-Pop or not, have to try it You will understand what I mean","I never leave reviews, but as someone who will probably never get to see a performance live, this makes my heart so happy! The quality is AMAZING! this is a must for any kpop fan! Keep it up!","The only problem of Venta-x is the number of its contents. If they still have all the contents from U+ Dive, they should release all of them. As I remember, they had hundreds of the VR contents. Keeping all the contents in their hard drive cannot make any profit. It can be a win-win deal for both Venta and U+. Also, I wish they update of the contents more often."
