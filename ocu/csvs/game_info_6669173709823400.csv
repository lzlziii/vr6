This one, however, surprised me. It was actually really fun. The magic felt great too. It makes it feel even greater that I can select tons of other spells to use for my quests instead of just the select few. The parry function feels great too, really hits just right to feel great. I also really like the items that we can use, like grenades and potions. Most other VR RPGs get boring after a good little bit of playing. This one, however, always leaves me wanting to play it more and more. The only thing that stops me is my headset's battery dying. In short, it's an awesome game with great game play. It's definitely worth the money. 11/10 on the bad*ss scaling I'd say, nothing is cooler than shooting fire from your hands.","I’ve spent about 10 hours to finish the main campaign. The graphic is good, combat system is good and the story is good too. I really recommend this game, it will surprise you for sure!","Please do a Sequel or a Prequel. And maybe add a Dating Mode where we can Date Iris or Reese Ception? (The Dating Mode Suggestion is a Joke, btw.) Aside from that, I Hope there's a Sequel where the Player and Iris can be a Team, again, unless they still are (I haven't beaten the game, yet, but seeing what happens after that Tournament, I think they part ways).","This game was , ... .. excellent, amazing , I just wanted more , and more .... thinking about it after a while ..compared to other games ...it's tops ....never forgot playing it ...more please",I didn’t really realize just how much I hate reading subtitles but the English update to this game took it from interesting and ok to one of the best games in my collection! The story is engaging and fun. The gameplay variety keeps me coming back and it feels like I’m part of the story. I hope they make new content for years to come!
