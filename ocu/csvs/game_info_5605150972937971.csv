I also had the opportunity to try the final version and despite the amount of work and models we are not there yet, it is practically an app for making a child play with animal models, when it would take very little to make it better. - 1-eliminate everywhere those black rectangles under the belly of the animals. - 2-the animations must be set so that the animal moves, but does not make movements which if real would have caused its movement in physical space, because if a crocodile carries out an attack but then does not move from its position, it looks strange it's false. o allow the animals to advance in the virtual space or give them more static animations - 3-important: always respect the size scale of animals compared to others - 4-serve menus for creating selected animals. - 5-also a full vr mode please - 6-good idea of tables with animal miniatures. how about creating collisions and gravity, at your choice in the menu? - 7-hear the soft sound of the animal when you approach it? - 8-the levels are unwatchable and with animals piled up in an improbable way, with real dimensions altered with respect to the various models, some collide with others and interpenetrate - 9-models are good, some excellent (almost all) others less. improve the eyes of the tortoise for example, at least give it a reflection in the eyes. - At present it is worth 4 stars, I will give 3 to encourage you to improve it, above all the first important thing is to respect the proportions of the animals with respect to each other, positioned close together is fine, but be careful of interpenetration, give a sense and an order, predators , prey, small animals, large animals, and huge animals of the past, assign them a logical and aesthetic positioning in the virtual space, do not throw them in bulk without any order or importance. technically there is good (indeed excellent) graphics for almost all models, a more reasoned and aesthetic construction of the whole context is missing. - good the possibility of various choices of type of animals, etc, the birds in flight make them fly by moving in a realistic way, or eliminate that section of birds in flight that you cannot grab, or make them grabable. - this app with these changes would easily be worth 15 euros, but if done well I would pay even 20, it doesn't matter, but an app done well I would buy"
