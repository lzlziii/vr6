Helps learn the zone and see the ball from the pitchers hand quickly.,"Love this so much, it has really helped me with my swing, love all of the drills, use it everyday. But I think it would be really cool if you could play actual games. You could have a campaign mode where you draft players for your team and try to win the World Series. You only do offense, defense is simulated.","It looks pretty fun and very helpful, but I dont understand why I need a membership. I have been doing pretty bad at getting on base and I’m just a 12 year old. Also I don’t know why it’s 19 dollars a month either, it would be better just to make it permanent or just maybe free","The price point on a membership for this game is absolutely insane at over $200 for a year. Not to mention that you cannot even do anything in the app if you don’t have a membership. My word to the developers or company, add a free account with a certain amount of pitches per day just to get people started. Your $20 a month membership fee is turning people like me (who could be loyal customers if you give us a try) away the minute we download the app. Or just add a flat cost to download the game, because that might be reasonable as well"
