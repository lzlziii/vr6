Oculus First Contact,"First Contact is an official Oculus experience built for Oculus Quest. Experience the magic of ‘presence’ in VR, exploring moments that feel as real as they are fantastically impossible. We've built a magic box full of toys and a robot guide; make a new friend, then touch, tap, bounce, hold and throw things, and play together. Oculus Rex designed First Contact, and is the team that brought you Dreamdeck, Farlands, Prologue and the original Toybox demo. We drew from the inspiration of the 80s: A magical decade when computers and game consoles moved from science fiction to household items and everything seemed possible. (And we wanted to show everyone where the save icon came from!) Special thanks to Fun Bits Interactive for porting this experience to Oculus Quest!",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Casual",English,1.12,Fun Bits Interactive / Oculus,Oculus,http://www.oculus.com/,"May 21, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2188021891257542/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2188021891257542&r=1, https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/?utm_source=www.oculus.com&utm_medium=oculusredirect",Terms of Service,581.6 MB,If only all games could give me the same feeling as Meta’s beginner games. This is definitely a perfect introduction at what your Quest 2 can do and the feelings you can get. Would highly recommend trying this out before you get TOO deep into your Quest 2.,I hope to put the program code of this application on Github and allow us newcomers to join the development of Unity Oulus,"That just so cool and fun there needs to be more single player stuff like this for oculus so many places are full of screaming kids some times a little rnr in vr is good, this game does that and just allows you to play on your own thanks loved it would love to see more like this epic.",The game was too short and the installed time was way too long. Waited four days for this to install and got a 20 second game like what the heck.,It’s great except I played in 2018 with my oculus rift
