I was expecting much more but there is like 20 ish objects you can break and they all are just broken within like 5 hits. It wasn’t enough game to cost anything. I don’t recommend buying it. It was entertaining for like 15 minutes.,Just downloaded this game and had a lot of fun playing it. The physics are good and there are plenty of objects to break! Might have missed it but it would be cool to be able to place more objects in one round. The space background is really cool and the game is very visually pleasing!
