I saw today that it had an update and decided to give it another try, and boy was I pleasantly surprised. It was a lot harder than I remembered and the Hall tour was a nice addition. Minor criticism Bots hit the ceiling at a clip that is too much in my opinion. Adding a varying wind factor will add another level of difficulty to the game. As a side note I would love to see a shuffleboard game both the indoor bar version and outdoor version that I'm sure the developers could do a bang-up job creating.","So basically you have to toss the bag in the hole on the wooden board and win with as much points as you get Itâ€™s super fun and keeps you entertained for hours, the only thing isâ€¦ nobody plays multiplayer ðŸ˜­ I would sit in the lobby for ages waiting for someone around my age (like 13) to play but in a few hours time someone would join. Of course that someone had to be a person aged really old and it was uncomfortable. I really want more multiplayer people to choose from. And the pass and play mode is awesome for family game night but why canâ€™t it be passed up to 4 people?? It sort of ruins the time having to wait a whole round before including the others. I love all the designs on the bags and the board! They are super pretty and keep the game awesome. Over all, I think it is a great game that you should play because it really is entertaining even tho I listed some bad reasons up the top. Those reasons are for the devs and shouldnâ€™t stop you from actually playing because itâ€™s the funnest game ever ( itâ€™s the best game on oculus I have ever played ) And I would rate it 9 + in age.","This game still has Christmas decorations in the lobby! When creating a multiplayer room, it kept adding my name continuously after two seconds to the room. By the time a few minutes went by my name seemed to be in the room hundreds of times, it has crashed many times and I have never been able to get fully through a multiplayer game. I have 1GB internet so that is not the issue. Until a viable update is released that addresses these issues I will not support any future products and you shouldnâ€™t either. LACK OF SUPPORT FOR THEIR GAMES. Download Walkabout Mini Golf, unreal support and continuous updates and the game JUST WORKS.","I purchased the game, but I only see three areas, if I recall. How many locations are there? I beat all the characters and can't find anyone online to play against. I guess I beat the game.... :(","While I love playing this game 1 on 1, multi-player is still having problems. Every multi-player game we have tried to play, fails. It freezes up, and we have to leave the game completely. You've stated in a previous reply that you created a fix for that issue, but clearly, it doesn't work, or the issue wouldn't still be happening. Please fix this game so we can all play together."
