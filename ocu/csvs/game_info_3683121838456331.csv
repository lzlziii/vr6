Solve simple but satisfying puzzles by manipulating physics objects and controlling tiny dragons over a collection of fractured floating islands. Enjoy nice scenery, solve puzzles, save adorable dragons and experience a mysterious ending. This is an early access demo version containing 7 levels, representing the first area of the game and accounting for roughly 45 minutes to 1 hour of gameplay.

Cannot wait for more of this game and ,ore from the developers. I am available for any Beta Testing or promotion!","Good fun and stokes the imagination! I still tell people about making some crazy bridge using like 20 ladders and a bunch of logs as counterweights lol. At times, unfortunately it can feel a little forgettable and tedious. It was definitely short and didn‚Äôt explain concepts well. I must‚Äôve spent 20 minutes being confused before I found out the dragons can fly in the last level. What‚Äôs cool about this game though is that may have just been my approach because this game is so open ended. If the developers start to add some more levels and play around with more physics based ideas like see saws and stuff, this game would take off. More interactive levels utilizing wind or geysers and different locations as you progress would go a long way. I have before and shall continue to recommend this game. I hope the developers do something great with it!","This is such a great little game... However, having a technical problem that means we can't finish it. Just two worlds left to do but no matter how many times we try, it always glitches us out, it just happens for no apparent reason, at no certain stage of levels, at start or half way through and it happens. Have tried everything, selecting sitting, standing, different guardian modes. Have checked possible connection/device issues... Nothing has worked and it is so frustrating (i have honestly, had to remind myself that it's an expensive bit of kit I'm using, in order to stop myself from smashing our quest to bits üò£üò≠) if anyone has had same issue and knows how to fix it, please share your wisdom üôèü§£. The reason it is so frustrating though, is because, it really is a great little game. Its different from anything else I've seen. It gets your brain working and for kids it is brilliant for problem solving skills. I'd happily pay for this game or ones like it. I'd give 5 stars if it wasn't for technical issue we are having.","This demo has about 8 levels (I think) and they‚Äôre all so cute. You‚Äôre essentially directing little dragons around through obstacles, and platforms, to get to a magical puddle. Obstacles include large canyons you have to get across, caves, and train tracks. Looking forward to seeing more!","Being a free applab demo/game, this feels like an actual oculus quest game as it is ab fab! The world is very cute, very cute weird little animal thingys. This game is fun for older people such as me and my kids love it too. It is like 3D lemmings. Amazing playability , def recommend for everyone to download"
