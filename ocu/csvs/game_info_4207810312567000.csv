Song in the Smoke,"Battle strange beasts and brave the elements to stay alive in Song in the Smoke: an expansive and mysterious VR survival game set in a world outside of time. Song in the Smoke puts survival in your hands. Enter a dangerous world and craft weapons, make clothes, build fires, and brew potions to defend yourself against vicious predators. Block, parry, and strike back with your club, attack from distance with your bow, or use your wits to sneak past the lethal creatures that call this land their home. The hunted also becomes the hunter. Use your senses to stalk prey in virtual reality: track their smell, follow their footprints, and plan your strike. When you‚Äôre ready, show off your skill with intuitive and responsive VR controls that let you execute the perfect shot. Travel between wildly different environments as you follow the guidance of your ancestors, and uncover the secrets of Song in the Smoke.",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Mexico)",1.5.3,17-BIT Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ,17-BIT Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ,https://www.songinthesmoke.com/,"Oct 7, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4207810312567000/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4207810312567000&r=1, https://www.songinthesmoke.com/faq/privacy-policy-terms-service",2.03 GB,"This game was so intriguing to me I had to get it even though I don‚Äôt care for survival games. Well, guess what? If YOU don‚Äôt like survival games don‚Äôt get this one as it won‚Äôt change your mind, like it didn‚Äôt mine. That being said this is the best most interesting survival game I‚Äôve seen. With it‚Äôs cryptic story and actual campaign and not just a sandbox, you get large sketchy areas to collect resources for tool making, and by hunting or evading otherworldly animals, or familiar ones like a boar, that‚Äôs 10 times the size of a regular boar. When nighttime comes, you better be ready. The mechanics are easy enough to understand and it‚Äôs not a complicated game. I do however find it to be immensely challenging and I‚Äôve only got to the third level before deciding I‚Äôve had enough. I‚Äôm not into constantly watching my food, sleep, fatigue, health gauges, but if you‚Äôre into survival games, I bet this would be a treat. The graphics and soundtrack make you feel like you‚Äôve taken a magic mushroom. I honestly wish this would be a stealth kind of game that would keep me intrigued enough to keep seeing the levels and story unfold. Now take this spamming! Take it! Take my spam!

L I N K T R , E E / D I S C O U N T F U R Y",This game is the absolute best survival game on quest 2 but not replayable! The best replayable feature would be multiplayer! Imagine starting a tribe with your friends and going out to raid some other tribes bases!!! It would be so much fun!!!! You guys do already have a great game with great sound building adventuring but ADD MULTIPLAYER!!! I would put 5 stars and I know other people would too you guys would make a lot of money!!! You guys are great!!! Have an excellent day!!! Please please please add multiplayer!!!,"This world really sucked me in. The survival is fun and challenging! But the exploration of the beautiful game worlds is the highlight for me. The hunting feels real but fantastical at the same time. Side note: if you have a Woojer vest this game is great for wearing it‚Äîadds another level of immersion. It took me a little while to realize building fires is the only way to save the game. Only suggestion for developers: more instructions or clues would be helpful. Or even a button that‚Äôs optional for additional clues. I love figuring it out on my own, but sometimes getting stuck really sucks too. üòÇ Again this is definitely a five star game!!",This game is amazing the areas are expansive and elaborate all the systems fit in and the combat feels buttery smooth and the horror elements will give you a few spooks but not enough to get in the way of the core gameplay. If you like survival at all you should buy the game I would have paid $60 dollars for this experience if not more.,Amazing game and u really can experience the life in jungles it worth spending time playing it
