Kinda figured it would be a 1-and-done type game but it turned into a top game on my quest. It’s not a complicated game but what little it does, it does well. I get a legit workout and sweat.",This game is great for quickly getting some cardio in. You can really work up a sweat due to the pace of blocks bouncing back at you. Wish the game had a way to play YouTube or a browser to play your own music built in. Overall great game. 4/5,"4 different challenge levels, good workout and power ups that can turn the tide of the battle. A nice variation (evolution) of boxing games. I definitely recommend it. Still a great game and it is on sale. In my original review I compared it to a rhythm game but is more in the lines with a boxing workout. I tend to feel more strained with this one than beat sabre. I recommend you try it! Its tough to create a game in a new medium and there are so many games that are just thrown together. I have seen others that are as good as this game and they just get overlooked. To the developer you did a great job with this. I am sure that if you keep up what your doing you can strike gold in the VR market. Cheers!",I've docked it a star due to the fact it's web only - connection is required for playing which is silly for single players and inconvenient. Also implies the game will be unplayable if the developer goes out of business. It's indicated in the details but I didn't notice it on purchase because you just don't expect such limitations.,"To start, this should be on the official store. This has a simple base concept but does it well. Think Pong from the 70’s, add in boxing, and bring it perfectly into VR. Clean graphics, great progression with a good risk/reward system, and unique upgrades. I’ve found that increasing haptics and boosting volume on sound effects does improve the feedback. Definitely a full body experience (though obviously more upper than lower body). The one on one duel aspect brings some similar feels as I get from Blaston. A few things I’d like to see would be some more environments and music…..or even better, pass through mode (like Blaston) and ability to play your own music (or YouTube) in game. Otherwise, an awesome VR experience!"
