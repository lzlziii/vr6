This game is that exact same vibe. You can't play it without smiling. Every interaction here makes sense, like being able to grab your opponents air hockey mallet to grab a couple cheap points, while both of you can't stop laughing. I just can't understand why everyone isn't already playing this. Visuals are simple, yet outstanding right off the bat, the ambience is amazing.",Thanks to this a app I found a cool kid from a different country he’s very very funny,Finally found a game that I’ll play for the rest of the time that I have my quest,This game is so awesome I love it I could spend all night on it
