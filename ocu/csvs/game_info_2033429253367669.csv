I got Nature tracks, I got Tripp, Liminal, Flowborne and countless more and I have to say, this was the first actual game app I got that had a linear campaign to it and was all meditative and reflective. It was overwhelmingly beautiful to me as it was one of the first experiences I‚Äôve had on VR and it took my breath away. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to length of time to beat the game as I was too focused on just about everything else around me. The garden, the boat, the different levels bringing you on search of new seeds and the flying air fish! This is an experience rather than a game, and one I wholeheartedly recommend.

I am so impressed with the graphics and the creativity. I could stay in there all day.,"I really enjoyed this game, but it's like... a five dollar game at most. The exploration is over quickly, but you can keep building your garden and I'm fine with that. What I'm not fine with is that decorative items (like wind chimes, and I'm not sure about shells or starfish but I can't find more) don't respawn, so you get like 3. It's too bright and I like all the darkness of the travel and wish I could make my garden darker. It's really hard to remember what seed grows into what without wasting a lot of seed points. And I have no idea what the floating ball over the disk does. It's just a decorative floating ball I guess? I had hoped the ball itself was like a little star and I could put them places and the disk would disappear, but it's still there and I don't get it. So, it's pretty and I enjoy it, but I'm sad about spending so much for what it is, so two stars. -_- Maloka is just as pretty (prettier?), darker, and free. Only problem is it doesn't let you choose seeds.","I like the game very much. Love it really. After you finish the games you can go back in the two boats and collect orbs and seeds again. I read reviews you can't but you can. I have three times so far. I don't like the garden layouts much but it's a bit addictive collecting orbs and planting more seeds. I put the more bizarre looking plants and really big purple bulbs outside the garden to decorate the entrances. One thing has me stumped and this is the tree when you first open the app, or return to it, that has the 3 peaches in the middle with illuminated light around them. You can pick them up and they are clear and now there are a snail and serpent in it but can't figure out what I'm suppose to do with it. I've tried everything.","such a cute game, I love creating the garden, and continue to play even though Ive finished the search, was sad tpo hear that this is it for this game...."
