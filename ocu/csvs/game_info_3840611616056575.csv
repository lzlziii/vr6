But why have we not the All in one Sports SUMMER edition ?,I love it but for boxing you should be able to punch in the stomach. And in baseball my favorite sport in it and irl. Hitting homeruns shouldn’t be as easy as it is you just swing slow. You should make it based on bat speed and bat path. Also you should choose which hand the bat is in. I love this game!
