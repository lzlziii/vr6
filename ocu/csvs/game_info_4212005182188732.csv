If you've been on any of these rides, you'll love this experience! This isn't just a one-off 'play it and you're done' game, it has a replayability factor, PLUS the game has a long roadmap ahead of it with lots of future additions at a later date. Totally recommended.",crazy how it feels like your in the moment. it kinda feels like you’re at disney and you are on the most immersive experience possible.,"Thank you!! My favourite virtual reality experience so far!!! A bargain for what it is in my opinion, and it’s not even finished yet! It’s like going on one of my favourite dark rides but from home and without the queues! My family is amazed as well! The main reason I bought vr glasses was to enjoy immersive experiences and I found one that was beyond my expectations. As a fan of theme parks and heavily themed dark rides, I was so excited to find into the metaverse! So much detail!! So thank you so much to the creator and I’m looking forward to the other rides as well, especially the haunted castle ride!","This experience came out and I was curious so I played it and only played it to before Shakespeare came out and I enjoyed it a lot, thought I had to pay for the rest of the acts so I simply uninstalled it. Installed it again because the thumbnail changed, and now I'm hooked!","If you were a fan of Horizons, World of Motion, and Spaceship Earth you will love this. Not sure why we don't have more experiences like this."
