My daughter doesn’t seem too interested in playing this after I paid $20 for it but I think that there’s just so many others that she prefers right now I tried playing this and had such a difficult time I gave up, but I do see the potential and only don’t recommend this to new players younger players and maybe just recommend to wait until the price tag gets cheaper and the developmental stages & bugs are worked out",I used to love watching Kindly Keyin play this game and to finally be able to play it myself made me very happy! So glad Keyin was used in the promotional material!,"This game is just to fun you can fast crawl with a technique, the game play is very interesting, many secrets too, and there is so much to explore!!!","It's really fun, but there is one downside I can't turn the turtle into a ninja turtle",It’s so fun!!
