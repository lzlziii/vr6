Just bought it to play on my 2 headsets, but it says no friends online when I try. We can see each other in the oculus social tab, shows us as online - but can't join a match together. Different FB account on each headset, did host on one headset, and join on the other.",definitely should play,"Various difficulty. Platform that can be moved. On a negative side, it was sometimes tricky to grab the block, and sometimes it will not slide as expected. As a result, I dragged everything very far just to make sure. Maybe make the block auto snap in place in easy mode would solve this issue.","Fun game to play, feels like Tetris in VR.. the harder levels get tricky, definitely worth trying with a friend too ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ","The Co-op mode is very entertaining, and the puzzles become very challenging even with two players trying to solve them. Definitely worth a try."
