Fun distraction with cute graphics.","The art design, music, levels, etc, all stunning. Great work there. It's a joy to experience. But the controls are awful. Incredibly twitchy. And there's no sensitivity adjustment. So you spend a lot of time wrestling with what feels like millimetre precision to aim the ball... While the cluster of balls is slowly moving. With a projectile arc that falls off way too soon. So it ends up like a really tedious, twitchy, archery game with poor tracking. Then as your clump gets closer and closer to the vortex, the little guy starts throwing you super unhelpful colours. It's frustrating, because it comes so close. A sensitivity dial and less arced projectile curve could probably save this.","A lovely looking game which could do with some new environments and maybe characters. Had a blast playing in multiplayer. Highly recommended, I prefer it to the angry birds game on quest",My sister and I played this game as kids and she gifted it to me this weekend for my birthday so we can play together. We send the invites. We accept them. She does it. I do it. We try from the party. From the app. NOTHING IS WORKING ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜¥ defeats the entire purpose of why she got it!,Ok here is my review of this game it is a good game to play but it is repetitive and after 10 to 20 minutes I got bored of playing it and switched to something else but for the price it should have been at least $10.00 instead of it being rated for $20.00 just my opinion though
