Rays Floating Maze,"Would you like to solve the maze that floats around you? The biggest feature of VR is that it reproduces a sense of distance close to reality by using binocular parallax. If this feature is incorporated into the game, I think that a game unique to VR can be created. In this game, we will use the intersections of the rays of light emitted from the left and right hands. At that intersection, trace the maze that floats in space. Would you like to try your sense of distance?",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), Dutch, French (France), German, Japanese, Russian, Russian (Ukraine)",1.4,三次元迷路工房,三次元迷路工房,https://3dmaze2020.wixsite.com/raysfloatingmaze,"Apr 1, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6948024548602253/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6948024548602253&r=1, https://3dmaze2020.wixsite.com/raysfloatingmaze/post/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,133.7 MB
