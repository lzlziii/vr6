Space Simulator 3D,"Create your own solar system in the outer space with Space Simulator 3D! ü™ê Add new planets üåè, moons üåò, stars ‚≠êÔ∏è, and asteroids. ‚òÑÔ∏è The universe sandbox is an addicting 3D space simulator based on realistic astrophysics. You will see how gravity will create the planet orbits and how galaxies or star systems like Milky Way Galaxy or Alpha Centauri form. üí´ This is a perfect game for astronomy and science fiction lovers. üî≠ Interstellar space exploration may not be possible for now, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt imagine creating our own solar system on the outerspace. üåí Perhaps your solar system is located at the Milky Way galaxy, or perhaps Alpha Centauri or other galaxies not visible even with the strongest telescopes. Through this realistic simulator that follows the astrophysics laws, you can see how the planet orbit forms and follow its track, and you can see how asteroids build up suns and entire galaxies. Space Simulator 3D is such an educative, fun, and exciting astronomy simulator app! Now with our understandings of astrophysics, we can create a realistic simulation about solar system that is not only educational but entertaining as well. Learn about gravity interactions in a fun and relaxing way, perfect for all ages. The best part about this outerspace gravity simulator? You don‚Äôt even need to own a telescopes to enjoy adventure in the outerspace with us!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Entertainment,", Education, Nature, Space & Universe",English,19.2,Magicware,Magicware,https://magicwareapps.wordpress.com/,"Mar 3, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5834263140001044/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5834263140001044&r=1, https://magicwareapps.wordpress.com/portfolio/space-n-gravity-simulator-3d-pro/#privacy",174.4 MB,"My full video review: https://youtu.be/-t4ks-udf18 Space Simulator 3D is an exceptional app that allows you to create your own star system and share it with others. Add planets and stars, and witness the fascinating impact of gravity and celestial object destruction on the trajectories and orbits of these cosmic entities. Immerse yourself in the role of a world creator within this remarkable simulation app designed for Meta Quest. While the visuals may not reach the level of sharpness I had hoped for, and the texture animation could have enhanced realism, these minor drawbacks do not detract from the enchantment of the experience. I found myself assuming a godlike presence, marveling at the ability to observe and experiment within this celestial realm at my disposal. Occasional bugs may be encountered, and the controls could benefit from a more intuitive design. However, despite these minor imperfections, Space Simulator 3D delivers a truly distinctive and unforgettable experience.","This is amazing! Creating planets with my own hands is almost too good to be true, I love it! Quite a lot of configuration options, stunning graphics, educational and fun to observe those gravitational patterns. Well done, really!"
