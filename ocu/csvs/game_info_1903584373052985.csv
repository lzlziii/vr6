It's super fun and the npc's are very lovable. There are Minor bugs, but what vr game is bugless. The only complaint that I could muster about this adorable game is that there is now way in the options to change your hight; so if you take the head set off without pausing then put it on you will be too tall and the only way I've been able to fix it without reloading is by redrawing the guardian. Over all hella good game super cute and feels smooth.","I absolutely love this game! It has such a fun little Animal Crossing feel, but also Garden of the Sea in VR. I am 60 ""days"" into the game and I'm not even close to finished!!! I love all of the tasks you have to do. Yes, if you don't like collecting things, the game will get repetitive. But the items you collect are all needed to construct buildings, complete upgrades, and purchase items. From chopping wood to mining rocks to fishing in lakes of lava, there's always something to do! My favorite is the farming!! There is something oddly satisfying about planting, watering, and harvesting crops as well as feeding your farm animals! I'm 50 yrs old and love this game.... so it may be geared for kids but it definitely appeals to adults! If you suffer from motion sickness, this is NOT the game for you!!!! It is smooth motion only. There is no ability to teleport.",Creative and adorable like creatures crash their ship! Help them build the town and get some clothes üòÇüíõ there‚Äôs things they need from you tho I‚Äôm sure you can do it! Don‚Äôt forget to take a look in the cafe cook up some really yummy treat for them kiddos ‚ù§Ô∏è decorate your town with cute furniture and grow your own crops in the farm land. Have fun with friends too! Don‚Äôt forget to help eachother ‚ù§Ô∏è,This is one of my favorite games ever! If you are thinking about buying it you should definitely buy it!,The game is great but can you guys please add a no racoon mode
