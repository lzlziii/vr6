Kartoffl - Demo,"*********** NOTE: This is the DEMO version of KARTOFFL. The full game will have 60 fun-filled and challenging levels, with many more cool devices and additional mechanics for you and the spuds to enjoy. *********** The spuds are on the run - and they need your help! There’s no questioning their adorable cuteness, but their intelligence is another matter, as they carelessly stumble to their demise unless you place the correct devices in their path. Partially inspired by oldschool Amiga classics such as Lemmings and Pipe Mania, the base premise of Kartoffl is simple: help the spuds get safely from point A to point B. The visual style is playful and full of character, while gameplay interactions are intuitive and snappy. Playable in full room scale VR, standing or seated, Kartoffl offers a fresh style of gameplay where hectic, time-sensitive puzzle mechanics are fused with the unique affordance of VR to put you close-up in the middle of the action. Now go save those spuds!",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Casual, Puzzle",English,1.0.011,Breach,Breach,https://kartoffl.com/,"Jan 18, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4622916527771810/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4622916527771810&r=1, https://breachvr.com/privacy/kartoffl/",251.3 MB,"The game is graphically successful and I was sure to like this lemmings like But unless I'm mistaken, it's a game where you'll have to play quickly since a small number of blocks are available and you'll have to remove them / put them back in a little panic If it's really that, it's a big disappointment because no desire to have stressful action in this cute puzzle game (ps: I stopped around level7 from the demo ; not being able during the pause to see anything -to make a point- was also very frustrating to me)","When is there gonna be a Full Game release to purchase? I’m already hooked on the game and only played a few levels. If I have 1 complaint, it’s the controls…. They don’t seem very intuitive. I’m always trying to remember how to rotate a platform is whatever before the little ones fall off the cliff. Other than that, this game is PERFECT",This is a fun puzzle game. The game really shines on the last level. The level got time management on where to put things and remove things at the right time and it was really fun and made me want to play more,"I love this game! The moment the full game is released, I'm buying it!!! It's so cute!! It makes you think! And the graphics are awesome!!! A truly wonderful game!","I have really enjoyed this demo and am looking forward to the release. I have played it on both my Quest 1 and Quest 2. But I have noticed that now it no longer works on either platform. I open it, see the loading screen and then I am back at the dashboard. Anyone else getting this behavior? Update: It now works. The devs fixed it in record time. Looking forward to the release."
