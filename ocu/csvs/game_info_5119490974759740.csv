I hope that will be one of Top 10 vr platform. When will be everythik done ? ü´°üëå‚ù§Ô∏è,"When I go to view the show, it says something has happened and is unable to proceed. I haven‚Äôt been able to see anything, so for me this is worthless. Using a Quest 2.","Some kinda music show social platform. Doesn't matter. I liked the hub environment, and that's what I judge these fly-by-night VR metaspheres.","I connected to the Muse show okay. Could look higher def, I suppose. But you included the one thing I hate about going to shows, standing next to and behind other people and having to listen to them chat louder than the performance. Why was this necessary to do? Gave it a second chance with the preview this morning. Someone's avatar was standing directly on top of me! Boy, I thought real people were annoying, but having pieces of an avatar phasing in and out in my line of vision as they move makes me long for the days of a 6-foot guy standing in front of me. WHY is this even possible???? I'm out!","Just watched the demo content, and the effect is pretty well realized with the 360 degree 3D camera rigs. Not as much depth or clarity as you'd hope for, but still better than the typical flat 360 bubbles that have been the norm for these virtual events in the past. You can spot the 360 degree camera rig from some of the viewpoints, and I'd almost like to see a tech ""Behind the scenes"" into how this all comes together. First show starts in a half hour for free. Can't beat that. Not sure what it would be worth if not free, but interesting none the less. UPDATE: Watched the first Muse show. Very cool. It did take a few retries to get in, and it looked like there were over 1,000 people connecting at the very start, so I imagine it's growing pains. Once I was in, it was pretty great. You are in a room with 10 or so others. Would be very fun to get a group of friends and join in together. I highly recommend going to the Map and choosing the ""Follow the Action"" option. They have a lot more camera angles than the few static spots they let you choose around the stage and it edits between them really well. A really cool experience. After each song it would force me to lock into one of the static cameras again and I would have to switch back to the ""Follow the Action"" auto view cam, but otherwise a really cool way to experience it. Definitely check it out for this Muse show. It's a lot of fun, for free, and a lot better than previous attempts at 360 degree flat static camera concerts in my experience."
