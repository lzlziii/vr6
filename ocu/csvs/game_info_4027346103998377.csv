Immediately when dropping in those nostalgic feelings came right back. The controls are exactly what I’d expect from a space arcade sim, same with the combat. The viewpoint aiming is a nice touch, basically if you can put eyes on the target, you can hit the target. Small critiques however: - I know this is an “in development “ game, but I’d like to see more ships. - I’d like to be able to start with both primary and secondary weapons, and being able to resupply the secondary with pickups like is already implemented. - I’d like a sense of speed. The maps are large and it takes a minute to get from point A to Point B, especially after resplendent. I mean I know space is infinite, but there is a lot of space here. - I’m hoping for more game modes. Convoy/base assault/defense? FFA, Team FFA, etc. Overall definitely a fun game, looking forward to more updates in the future.",I think this game definitely has something in it but my main concern is motion sickness. When you turn it has this unnatural immediate turn instead of slowly turning into it. Literally look at any other game like this and that’s the physics in it. But yeah that would be a good start for sure.,It is a great game better then some games you have to pay for! My only complaint is the controls. The VR controls are a little wacky and it doesn’t help that your hand can move anywhere. So maybe stop the motion of the hand and have it grip on to it? I don’t know if it will fix it but it will sure make the game look a bit better. And remember to make the hand move to where the controller is in real life when they let go. But besides that it is great! And I would totally recommend this to my friends if they had a VR headset!,"iv always really liked piloting games and this definitely didn’t disappoint it’s a bit like elite dangerous as how the basic controls work and the touchscreens but it’s not super complex and the flight and fighting is smooth and really enjoyable. overall i had no issues whatsoever my only complaint is that, because of being an applab game, just about nobody plays it so there’s never anyone online for the multiplayer so i never got to fully enjoy it which was disappointing but i hope by writing this that people will give it a shot and see how good it actually is really a solid 9/10 game it’s a real shame how oculus shuns applab the way it does and makes it hard for games they don’t approve to kick of on their platform other than that i’d suggest more customization to kinda add character to the individual player (but not overboard and annoying) and maybe before the tutorial starts let them choose between virtual or “on controller” flight joysticks ~KM"
