Chess Adventure,"Chess Adventure is an innovative, virtual reality (VR) chess game that takes players on a journey through various worlds and environments. As players progress through the game, they will encounter new challenges, puzzles, and opponents that will test their skills and strategy. But Chess Adventure is more than just a game. It's an investment in the future. Early purchasers of the game will benefit from a special price that will be much lower than the eventual price of the game. As we continue to add new features and content to the game, the price will go up, but early adopters will have locked in their price and saved money in the long run. In Chess Adventure, we use VoiMo media and NFTs to create a seamless and immersive gaming experience. Players can communicate with other players, trade NFTs, and share their game progress. They can also purchase NFTs to customize their avatars, equipment, and more. Chess Adventure is just one example of the possibilities of our metaverse. We believe that the future of gaming lies in the intersection of VR, blockchain, and AI, and we're building a metaverse that will bring these technologies together. So join us on this adventure, and be part of the future of gaming and virtual reality.",3+,"Multiplayer, Single User","Standing, Sitting, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Casual, Puzzle",English,"1.0.1
