POLLINATOR PARK,"Europe 2050 – Following a cascade of ecological crises, our world has been deprived of healthy ecosystems and wealthy flora. Amidst this dystopian landscape lies a lavish green beacon of hope: Dr. Beatrice Kukac’s Pollinator Park -a futuristic farm, a safe haven for pollinating insects and an eye-opener for its visitors. Pollinator Park is a crossover between a zoo, theme park, an interactive museum and a crystal ball: fun, educational and emotionally engaging. As a park visitor in 2050, unravel the story of its founder Beatrice Kukac, try your hand at pollination, shop for grocery shopping in a pollinator-deprived world, rediscover nature’s perfection and find out how you can help protect it in the real world. The European Commission's virtual Pollinator Park was built in collaboration with ‘archiobiotect’ Vincent Callebaut, in his signature eco-futuristic style. Step into this beautiful virtual reality about the ugly future we face without pollinating insects!",3+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Documentary & History, Educational, Exploration",English,0.76,Poppins & Wayne,European Commission,http://www.pollinatorPark.eu/,"Mar 19, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3630788480370853/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3630788480370853&r=1, https://commission.europa.eu/privacy-policy-websites-managed-european-commission_en",758.5 MB,"Little changes that we all can make for a better environment! Pollination is fascinating, the presentation here is pretty good, with plenty of interaction.",Kind of weird that I did this at school but I did this at school. It is awesome and I took my time. Mind blowing in certain ways and eye opening.,Very good experience on store,"I'm always leery of any ecological/environmental messages; the gist is often a thinly-veiled scheme to kill off half of humanity, ostensibly to save some grub from extinction. I didn't get that vibe from this application. Admittedly, I skimmed through some of the stuff and, thus, may have missed evidence of a nefarious secret plot. From what I saw, however, it was an interesting and well-implemented interactive presentation about the pollination process, its implications for mankind, and what individuals can do to help facilitate pollination in their own backyards. It was creatively presented as a tour of a futuristic pollination center. The visuals, animations, etc. were all decent. Overall, it was well optimized, but I experienced intermittent stutters (pretty jarring in VR) when clicking on certain things or moving to new areas of the map. I also had occasional problems teleporting. Some interactive parts of the map appear to be set up to snap the user to a specific point. I sometimes found myself unintentionally ending up in those points while trying to go elsewhere. Despite these hiccups, I really enjoyed Pollinator Park and would recommend it.","The positive: It is well done. Good music The negative: I wish I could skip the intro and that the application exit automatically at the end. I also wish more explications on the different species of bees, a map where you can find each species, the anatomy of a bee, the various job of bees, etc... Finally, the exhibit with price tag was quite boring as the only one working was the toilet paper. I could not figure out how to activate and see the price of other food. The quiz should explain the answers too."
