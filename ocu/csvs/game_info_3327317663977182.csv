Okay I like the game but sometimes I want to take the headset off and throw it across the room in frustration. It is very hard to progress in this game. After playing a specific area and you don't make it after a certain amount of time the game makes you start all over from the beginning of that level. Thru out that level there are multiple check points...why do I have to start from the beginning again.

Like you’re inside the old Crash Bandicoot game, really fun. Challenging but it puts you in a good mood. Highly recommend.",Overall an ok game. Camera angles can be a little frustrating but a nice little platformer.
