Richie's Plank Experience,"Richie's Plank Experience was designed to invoke the strongest possible emotions in the shortest possible time. Entertain your friends and family as they walk the plank, 80 stories high. Knees weak, palms sweaty. If that doesn't get them, Santa Simulator, Nightmare Mode and flying in the hero academy missions will. If you're expecting a 2 hour game for yourself, this probably isn't for you. If you plan to entertain your friends and family or if you want a crowd to gather, this is the title to do it. HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES This game invokes a near-instant emotional reaction. Due to the nature of virtual reality, this experience can set you off-balance and affect your decision making. The following safety guidelines will reduce the risk of serious injury or harm. 1. Ensure there are two adult supervisors who are alert and capable of catching you if you lose balance. 2. Do not run or jump off the plank. 3. Pick an activity space clear of any objects in your surroundings and keep a clear buffer around your space. 4. Establish a no pushing or provoking rule that is enforced and taken seriously. The plank walk is designed for ages 13+. If you are under the age of 18, please have this safety guide and EULA reviewed and agreed to by your parent or legal guardian. Please note that you bear responsibility for your actions while you play Richie‚Äôs Plank Experience.

It‚Äôs not just walking a plank! You can race and fly like iron man. You can paint the y and defend the buildings from incoming missiles. If you‚Äôre up to it try horror mode üëÄ. If you want something lighter be Santa and throw gifts down the chimney üéÖ","The first experience I have bought for my Quest. I absolutely love it. This is what VR is all about! Fantastic scaling, and great graphics. Very intense, very funny, just about every emotion is covered in this. I thought I was ok with heights... Clearly not! Lol Superb purchase. Let's see a sequel, or just more experiences like this please!",Genuinely a good game. I love the realism and different modes. And all for a good price. Definitely a buy üëç 25 0/0 off: bit(dot)ly/OculusDisc Replace (dot) with a period Please like the post it really helps!!!,"But I don‚Äôt blame the developer. This is 100 years old. It‚Äôs such an old game designed especially for newbers. You basically walk off a plank on a high rise to your doom. If you‚Äôre bored of that main motif here, why not go flying with rocket gloves and take down other rockets? You know? For the that plank experience? There are time trials as well I think. I haven‚Äôt been in plank world for over a year. I was going to refund the app but my wife likes the flying part of it. If you want to have a VR experience party with friends, I think this can do? If you want this, use my link below. I always write honest reviews so call me spammy if you want, but I spam none but spammers themselves! Spam ham to one another. Change comma to period. Start planking.
