Tried it because it looked interesting and can't beat the price. Engaging storyline and the creators did a great job with the bow physics. Graphics also exceeded my expectations for a game at this price. I'm really glad I added this one to my collection.,It has a few bugs and the bow mechanics are amazing. But some of the puzzles and door codes took me 20 minutes to figure out. Free beer for youüç∫üç∫üç∫,"Excellence in all aspects. Especially the unpretentious but aesthetically pleasing, freshly original and highly immersive graphic environment. Also the very clever multiple and intertwined use of the scenic tableaus. Perfect sound and noise architecture as well as gripping voices. There are several layers of gamer interaction. Strangely, all those who commented the game, missed at least one. By example, whenever there are movable big objects, you can stack them, teleport to the top of the stack and from there to higher ground. Also, the cable free MQ2 allows you to evade hostile fire by ducking behind walls or boulders. One quite strange thing, though. The storyline is not completed but cut off quite apruptly after the last mission. At first I thought that I had missed a decision point, which would have me allowed to switch allegance from Vatr to Motr. And that therefore Vatr instead of being grateful that I disposed of Motr trapped me forever in the safehouse. But no, because if I revisit the sceneries of the missions, I find that Motr is still there. This is a terrible burden for the standing of FTG. Will you amend, eventually?","I don't dislike story, but when games (Especially VR games) shove it down your throat it becomes boring. It's not really that great of a story either, the worst part is the bow, the main mechanic, really sucks to control. Overall I don't dislike many vr games, but even at $15 this game felt like a waste of time and money. The visuals were pretty good, but that doesn't matter to me at all."
