Please fix this,"It’s missing some major data that - as a user - I want to see. So what’s it missing? - data on how I’ve improved over time - data on how I compare to others broken down to others my age, my gender and what the median standards are Not knowing if I have good memory (or coordination etc) is a major flaw of this app. If it had these things in it I’d be willing to pay for the app. As it stands, since it was free I’m not going to leave a too harsh low star review. But I also won’t be using it moving forward because why would I? I don’t know if I’m good, improving, or have something I need to worry about. Hoping the devs take this on board."
