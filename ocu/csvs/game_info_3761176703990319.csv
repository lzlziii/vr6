I loved this mix of Oh Shape with Synth Riders and Audiotrip. The songs are very well mapped! I wish I could play more songs, there's only 15-20min of content. I miss some sound feedback and a better haptic feedback (it's too subtle). Those trail of dots sequences could be easier, like in Synth Riders and Audiotrip, because you end up losing your combo very easily. But overall, it has a lot potential! Keep improving and it will be as good as those big rhythm titles!",Really gets you up and moving! After just a few minutes I was sweating and tired. Super fun!
