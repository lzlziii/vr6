Whenever I start it the cloud sync message starts and then it crashes back to the home environment. I tried to start it over and over and one time it booted into the game, but after I exited I'm back in the same situation. Perhaps it is incompatible with v55? Rebooting and reinstalling made no difference. I'll update the review if a fix can be found",I just bought this app and it's not working at all! It won't open. It's showing cloud sync then doesn't open no matter how many times I've tried. Did I pay for nothing? What can I do ? I want to play this app and it doesn't open.,"I was so excited to play this. but this is such a let down. such short gameplay. finished the few levels, in a night. felt cheated. was so excited to see miku. but it's all sooo short! update and augment this please",This game was a part of my childhood and the moment I saw it I downloaded it and started playing so as you can imagine my sadness when there was ONLY 4 chapters I‚Äôm sure that you guys can make the whole play through for the faith and trust of your customers. BTW I played all four already and I was very happy and it was fun I‚Äôve had it for like an hour üò©,"Honestly, if you're a fan of the original space channel 5 and you own a quest, you need to play this. It was so much fun üòÖ had a smile on my face for most of the game. I was super glad I could switch to the Japanese dub aswell üôè The ONLY reason why this isn't 5 stars is it's literally under an hour. You'll best the entire thing SUPER quickly. You can pick up the original for a couple dollars, but the price is kind of steep for a couple hours of fun. I'd buy DLC in a heartbeat, or a follow-up game (hopefully they make that a little longer) ~ but I do HIGHLY recommend this game üíñ 4/5*'s (even though it's actually 5/5 and it's just a little too short) üòÖ"
