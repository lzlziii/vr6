And the game needs a little bit more speed and multiplayer so I can have help to complete level 1 and we need more levels like next make the level of fun,"this is a great game just needs a few minor fixes, first time i was playing level 1 i couldnt go threw the side room with the screwdriver was in. Also in level 0 you should add the rooms like in the backrooms like the vannilla room if you havent added already and keep progressing with this game like add level 3 4 5 6 and so on once you add enough levels you should add multiplayer it would be more fun with multiple levels instead of just the first 2 multiplayer should be 2-4 people anything over would be to much and a little feature if you add multiplayer is you will have hazmats on. otherwise fun game too play","So I was playing and I was like “Wow..” The Minecraft drinking sound played when I drank the soda, And I was in the elevator next you know it. BACKROOMS! I hope being slow is fixed…..",Hi. Super good game I mean it keep it up. But multiplayer would be amazing if you add it I would be so happy.
