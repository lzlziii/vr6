Manipulate objects in stalled time to save the crew. Experiment with physics, allowing you to find creative solutions to the catastrophes happening onboard the ship. Set up crazy situations just to see what happens when time goes back to normal.",7+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Puzzle","English, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Mexico)",1.0,Force Field Entertainment B.V.,Oculus Studios,http://www.timestallvr.com/,"Aug 15, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2055554051161375/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2055554051161375&r=1, https://vertigo-games.com/privacy-policy/",1.84 GB,"I've always been a huge fan of Quicksilver type time-stopping and so I wanted to play a game basing on such a scheme. I completed the game and all the challenges in 2 days, so it's only a 4-star. It would be awesome to get an endless/free mode for the real fans of bullet time. Either way it's overall a great game and I'd love to see more.","I've been looking for a game with bullet time. I know, there is so many, but this one *and almost ONLY this one* allows you to move freely in stalled time. Love it! One of the best VR Games I have. Cheap, too! For this quality and that much interactive things and gadgets, it's very reasonably priced. If you are looking for a bullet time game, this is the one for you. I just wish other games could be like this one.",This game is very funny and is underrated so I think this game needs more support.,This is an amazing game but it was too short. Definitely worth the money.,"I believe Timestall is on the same level as ""I Expect You To Die"" in terms of puzzels, humour and graphics. But I believe Timestall is under rated simply because 'I expect You To Die' has a cool James Bond theme going which is very popular. Bottom line: If you enjoyed 'I Expect You To Die' and you're looking for a similar type game, then look no further than Timestall."
