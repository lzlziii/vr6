Chess Mate,"Wanna play some chess? This game provides you with everything you need to play chess and have fun. You may wonder what's unique about this game. You can throw the pieces all around the room or at your mate. If this is not enough for you, then maybe try winning with an Alien-Ai, or just try to play against the pigeon... anyway, nobody is reading these descriptions, so go ahead, watch the trailer.",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Social, Strategy",English,0.373,DoeButchersGames,DoeButchersGames,http://www.doebutchersgames.com/,"May 20, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5875411075863441/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5875411075863441&r=1, http://www.doebutchersgames.com/privacy.html",1.06 GB,Seems like a very nice twist on vr chess. Its a bit wierd that this game doesnt have online multiplayer option up and running because there is a FREE chess app also in development and the multiplayer works fine on that app. Seems like a waste of money. I might ask for a refund within 12 days if no progress is made
