Visitations,"Aesthetic experiences are brought into the therapeutic realm using lessons from neuroscience and psychology. Visitations makes use of techniques such as binaural beats, subtle strobing, form constants, and includes a guided meditation, a dream induction, and a soundtrack developed by a healer with experience leading traditionally inspired ceremonies. Visitations creates a set & setting which allow users to turn inwards and explore their own stories and mental states.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity, Medicine, Relaxation/Meditation",English,1,Object Normal,Light Clinic,https://visitationsvr.com/,"Mar 11, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3854611534668480/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3854611534668480&r=1, https://visitationsvr.com/privacy/",Terms of Service,203.7 MB,It has some room to improve but there is some quality tools here for the price. Hope to see some updates.,"My favourite VR meditation app. Nice choice of music or ""body scan"" guided meditation (no hokey ""inspirational"" talk, thank goodness). Several visually pleasing and engaging scenes to choose between. I especially like: - Forest river - Neon mandelas - Crystal contours - Drifting Nebula Some of the other scenes (e.g. ""soft flowing"" and ""sunset beach"") seem promising, but need a visual upgrade. Something is very wrong with ""Spider's Nest"" -- too much of the foreground remains fixed on the screen even when moving one's head, which is headache-inducing. I hope that's fixed, and more scenes are added (or visually improved). Additional soothing background music options would also be very welcomed. Still, it's already excellent value at just $10 (with no ongoing subscription fees, unlike some of its competitors). Highly recommended for relaxation / sleep preparation.",The visualizations are wonderfully done. Hypnotic and soothing to look at. I wish there were a few more scenes and maybe a few variations of the distraction game. Unfortunately I assume that will be unlikely considering this app is probably pretty niche.,waste
