Survival Nation,"Survival Nation is an open-world online RPG zombie survival game designed for VR. SURVIVAL To survive, you need to remember about food and water. You can get food in many ways: by fishing, hunting, gathering, or scouring abandoned houses. ONLINE They say that cooperation is the key. It is no different here. Survival Nation is a game that focuses on multiplayer mode. You can join other players and participate in a joint adventure and exploration of the world. PROGRESSION Survival Nation is not lacking in RPG elements either. A whole bunch of missions and side activities are waiting for you. You have at your disposal 3 unique skill trees, which you develop with each level you gain. ACTIVITIES In addition to quests and many forms of food gathering mentioned earlier, there are many other activities. You can search for items with a metal detector, climb on top of various spots, search for treasure using riddles, and much more. WEAPONS Survival Nation offers a mass of diverse weaponry, starting from pistols and rifles up to bows. Each weapon has not only different statistics but also a feeling and a way of reloading.

Why? First the Pro's: -Huge open world, which is to be expanded in the future. -Many different enemy types -Skill and level system -PVP mode -Many crafting options - Fishing -New weapon holster system -Full body mode -New realistic weapons reloading -Very good graphics on Quest 2 for such a big open world game. -Climbing (in certain places) -Eat, drink, Cook -Already a large variety of weapons that can all be leveled up. -Many quests for single players -Constant updates from the developers -Active Discord Server -Developers who try to respond to the wishes of their players Con's: -Some animations seem choppy, -No gore system (blood, etc.) -The sound effects are sometimes really strange (the footsteps of a rabbit sound just like those from a zombie, sometimes it's impossible to tell from which direction the zombies are coming because you can't clearly assign the noises) -No weather effects -No day and night cycle -The new airdrop feature is not available in single player Mode -No real physics system -No weapon repair or weapon parts upgrade system I've been playing VR for a long time and have rarely seen VR games that have made such great progress in their development in such a short time. The developers still have a few things on their roadmap for players to look forward to. For the price you get one of the most comprehensive quest 2 games and it is worth every penny!","This is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for as far as VR games go! I‚Äôm 49 years old and I have been playing arcade and console games my whole life, so I‚Äôm pretty picky about what I like and what keeps me interested long-term in a game and this game nails it! My girlfriend and I play it together in co-op and she likes it, so that‚Äôs a huge bonus! This is my favorite VR game by far and hopefully there are more updates and Zombie Nation sequels to come from this amazing title! Peace! :)","FINAL EDIT: The devs are currently making good on the roadmap with regular updates. So much of the game has improved already, I am very impressed with the work ethic of this team! They are listening with open mind to all suggestions on the discord and doing everything they can to polish this game. Def worth the price right now and getting better even as I speak. If Into The Radius appealed to you, but was too difficult, this is the game for you EDIT: devs are making good on the updates so I have faith this will be much better in time. I know devs are going to work hard to improve this so maybe they can build on this very raw foundation and make something really good. Game needs more time to cook. This would have been an awesome app lab game for $12.99","This game will keep you busy for days. It's so much fun, and it's still growing and being fine tuned. The developers are active and attentive, and seem to listen to the community, so although it has alot of room for improvements, it's nice to be here in it's early stages to see it grow and evolve. Do yourself a favor, and go into settings and turn off name tags, and health bars, and damage numbers, etc. This will make it a little more immersive, and a little less cartoonish with numbers popping up every time you shoot your enemies. There are tons of activities and achievements, and it took me a good solid week (of playing multiple hours a day) to reach the max level and complete almost all of the achievements. - And it's still fun to explore and scavenge for items, even afterwards. 'Skills' and activities include: Fishing, Cooking, Climbing, Crafting, Scavanging, Treasure Hunting, Slaying Zombies, and more. The quests are pretty easy and straight forward, with some basic story line, but nothing too deep and complicated. I found them enjoyable for what they were. It has it's fair share of bugs just like any other game, but I haven't personally experienced anything too bad. Over all, it's a really nice and solid video game, that will only evolve and get better over time. So join in, and help it grow. ü§†üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßüüßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßü","25 off for the VR homies: b i t , l y / s u r v i v a l n a t i o n (comma is a period and remove all spaces) My wife and I have really been enjoying this game together. The sense of progression in leveling up and upgrading gear/skill-trees reminds us of playing an MMORPG together. Well done to the developers for putting in so many systems that are so satisfying in VR. So much to do.. fishing cooking crafting climbing exploring zombies cosmetics metal detecting scavenging online multiplayer ect and the music is very relaxing. Something about this game is extremely relaxing, even though zombies. Give it a shot."
