For example: The characters' mouths don't move when they are talking on the broom, There are no male avatar options (However that is expected since Luna Nova is a school for witches, not wizards) , The graphics are quite low but I didn't mind it at all, There barely any people on the online play And finally, after you complete the game, it gets pretty boring. But i am still rating it 4 stars because it was really fun to play while doing the races with various characters from the series and the animation is really good!",I really love this game.To be honest I donâ€™t know why the mouths donâ€™t move when your on the broom?You get to collect crystals and race other players.Even though the fly online part is not that good I still love it!I really like how the creator did the animation and the character design!I think the avatar editor could be better but no matter what I still love this game.,"Thanks for English voice actors. I think you can try improve graphics, I believe oculus quest2 can handle it. Another game to my VR collection.","This game is lit bro- anyway sometimes i rage quit because when im flying(start) im looking forwards and it just keeps on telling me to look forwards and its not moving, but overall its really gooooooooood ðŸ˜ƒor im just doing something worng.."
