Pleasantly surprises but dang that creature gets mad easy ! Lol great game plz tell me there's more to come! Totally recommended!!! Everyone who loves escape games should hav this in their library! Definitely one of my favs!,So far I’m loving the game even though I haven’t gotten too far. The puzzles are challenging but not impossibly hard to figure out like some games I’ve run into. My biggest complaint is the navigation. It gives me a bit of motion sickness. Would love to have a navigation option that takes you to key points instead to help with that :) have gotten to the lab rat so far but had to stop because my stomach couldn’t take it anymore.,"The truth is that it has been a pleasant surprise. I like virtual escape rooms like The Room VR and I have also participated in several escape rooms in real life and although I have not finished it yet, so far the experience has been very satisfying. The puzzles have a good progression and have the right point to not be too easy but not too difficult and end up being a frustrating experience. There are some details to improve but the developer has already told me that they are working on correcting them, so it's a very good experience that will offer you a very good time for a very fair price.","Even if some VR interactions could be much better (solvable with some patches), the overall puzzle design is awesome. Very Escape Room-like, with clues that are in front of you, but don't realize it until later. This leads to lots of ""Eureka!"" moments, which makes everything more satisfying.","This game is a short experience, but it's very challeging. The puzzles are a bit difficult and you have to think and stay very focus on the environment to solve them. It needs more content and, in my opinion, needs more context too, specially at the beginning, but it's fun."
