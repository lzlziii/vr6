How do I feel? Energized, joyful, expanded!!! The visual journey is like a psychedelic trip enhanced by the musical score. Colorful geometrics pulled my psyche inwards as I experienced spaciousness and the state of simply “being”. Who says meditation needs to be boring!",Fantastic guided meditations. The visuals are beautiful but do not get in the way of the overall experience. It's not overwhelming for beginners and is deep enough for those who are experienced with meditation. Great job!!,You should probably just turn off the mediation words and find inner peace just with the visuals.,"This app is absolutely Incredible, I love it. I've done all the meditation apps, I really dig this one. I will be Tripping with Mood on the Regular."
