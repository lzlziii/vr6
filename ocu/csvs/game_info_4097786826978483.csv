The courses are good and the graphic aren’t to horrible. But my only problem with it is the golf balls hit box is far to bag and I find myself hitting the ball backwards when I swing the golf club,This game is free and it took forever to find a free golf game like this,it’s a good game and fun when waiting for friends to get on but one thing i would like added is a option to reset the shot your on even if the ball is still in the air,"I've had this game for a while now and the developers have really added a lot. There are a lot of issues with the interface still and the ball physics need major work but the full course looks nice and if they can shore up the game play a bit, it could be a really good game. The biggest issue I had today is the that games are not working. No ball showed up on the tee in the balloons game so we were unable to play that. We switched over to the buildings game and there was a ball on the tee but we were unable to activate it by pressing any of the buttons or touching the white block. Moved on to the Greenie game and again, there was no ball and no matter what we tried, we could not get one to appear. There is a ""pinfix"" option ijn that game that is unexplained and clicking it didn't do anything. Played a few holes on one of the courses and every shot I hit was going straight left or right. There is no way to know the lie you are in and no marking on the ball so you can set yourself up. Not having feet in VR requires some method of determining where you are facing. I was unable to hit anything straight off the tee and while I'm not a pro golfer, straight tee shots are something I can certainly do. Putting needs a ton of work. You can slam the ball and it will start off fast but slow very quickly and only go a few feet. It's very rough but could turn into a good game at some point. The developers are adding a lot so hopefully it will improve. It needs more explanation on how to play: activating the ball, etc. because you're just kind of left to figure everything out. There is a preset for the Deadeye controller in this game and you are able to make X, Y and Z club adjustments, but I found that no matter the settings, this big hand is in your way and blocks your view when trying to putt. It completely blocks your view of the ball. That definitely needs to be removed or at least have a toggle to not show the hand as it's quite obstructive.",it’s what you get for free.
