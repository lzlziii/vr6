Beat Blaster,"Beat Blaster is a VR game of shooting, running and dodging where everything happens to the music rhythm. An original mix of styles where each game will offer you a new challenge. 30 SONGS & AMBISONIC AUDIO Each level introduces a novelty and all the games are different thanks to the intelligent generation of levels. Ambisonic sound lets you experience the music in an entirely new way. 4 WAYS OF MOVEMENT You can choose between the classic VR controller, the new 3dRudder, tilting the head or the intuitive and original control based on the movement of the head. NO MOTION SICKNESS Beat Blaster is a VR game with a high-speed component. But all moves in the game are designed without rotating the player, thus minimizing the probability of motion sickness. EASY RULES To clear a level, you must reach the end of the song without dying. You have a Blaster with infinite ammunition and a single life to dodge or kill all the enemies that will appear to the rhythm of the music.",7+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Music, Shooter","English, Chinese (China), French (France), Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish (Spain)",1.91,Ivanovich Games,Ivanovich Games,https://www.ivanovichgames.com/,"May 3, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3798510533541783/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3798510533541783&r=1, https://www.ivanovichgames.com/privacy.html",Terms of Service,214.5 MB,"I‚Äôm surprised this method of locomotion hasn‚Äôt been used for more games. It does take a bit of getting used to but once it clicks you‚Äôre good to go and it feels amazing. For me, I play best when sitting cross-legged on the floor with a pillow behind me and that‚Äôs how I made it through all levels. If I try to play sitting in a chair or standing up I‚Äôm like a complete beginner all over again and can barely get past the first level! I like most of the game music (level 2 tune is a banger and wish it reappeared in later levels) and I usually select which level to play based on that rather than difficulty. With that in mind it would be cool if the song could be previewed before entering the game as I can‚Äôt always remember! Thanks devs- sorry for not leaving a review sooner.","The devs have done a great job with their latest updates in fixing the choppy framerate issue, while also adding a tutorial level and improving the graphics. Runs and looks great now on the Q2. The main game is 30 levels long, while progressively upping the challenge with more enemy types to deal with. Each level is procedurally generated, meaning no 2 runs will ever be the same, which also adds to the totally addictive nature of the game in trying to get the best score you can and making it onto the leaderboards. I've actually made it to the number 1 spot on one of the later levels. üòÄ The head-based movement system is absolutely bang on and very precise once you get used to how it works. It should only take 5 or 10 minutes to get comfortable with it. It's one of those very addictive games that keeps pulling you back in for one more attempt at trying to improve on your high scores. If you enjoy action shooters, such as Pistol Whip, I honestly think you'll love this game. I highly recommend it. üëç","Appreciate the devs doing this, and like they said I don't expect it too look as good as the PC version, but I reckon if they did a quest 2 only (not original quest) update could push it further towards the playstation VR version. Keep up the good work! Just need to work a bit more on the smoothness of the games still a bit stuttery... Very addictive and fun game though!","The previous version was good, but there have been a few bad updates. The speed of movement with the thumbstick should not have been this fast before. This makes it too fast and hard to do. Tweaking the thumbstick is difficult. I would like to see an option to at least specify a maximum movement speed. This app is wonderful to use offline and is a powerful game that can easily be played while sitting down. So it would be quite good for a VR beginner to experience it, but it is too difficult at this movement speed.",This game is so much fun!! The music is amazing and the levels are crazy love it!!!
