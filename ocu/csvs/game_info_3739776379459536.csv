The information given, the films which are available, the way the virtual space was conceived - simple, clear, efficient - and the fact you can talk to other visitors. I did not know the ""Alliance Française"" before, and I have learned a lot ! It makes me want to go there to see the real building when the construction is over. Well done ! Note for the developers : I have encountered a technical issue regarding the spatialisation of sound in the films : the sound appeared to be centred at my left so if I wanted to hear properly I had to look left a bit ""too much"", maybe you could re-centre the soundtracks?","Great experience, loved talking with others from all over the world. The VR try on was amazing!"
