Glad I bought again as this is a solid rogue lite sci-fi shooter with nice clean colourful graphics, cool soundtrack and atmosphere, and tons of cool weapons to choose from. I’ve been really impressed with how the dev has responded to player feedback since day one and is constantly updating and improving the game. Although I’ve completed the game on main mode I’ve barely dipped my toe in the other modes so still lots to explore. Sure there is still the occasional bug- like losing a weapon- or game crash but there are a lot of moving parts to the game so not surprised if the matrix glitches every now and then! Good work dev! Look forward to a sequel or any other vr games you make in the future.","I really never played roguelikes, they really didn't interest me. However, sweet surrender changed that. It's relatively simple game to learn and hard to master but the randomness gives it such a high replayability. And the special classes come in to fill my completionist itch, giving a quick defined playthrough of what you want to do. While I do wish there was more in terms of progression rather than completing class specific achievements or collecting the various weapons and chips, it is a truly amazing game. A few bugs that should be made aware. -The acid grenade changes into a leech grenade when going up floors with it in your inventory. (Holding onto it when going up works fine) -The electrostatic spear sometimes just disappears if you put it away. (Go slowly when putting away this weapon. Idk why but it works better this way)","This is a solid FPS rogue lite with a good upgrade system. There's multiple ways to play and this is probably one of the harder rogue lites IMO. Although the shop upgrade system they put in has made the game much easier than it used to be. My only criticism of the game is that some of the class challenges are extremely unbalanced. The sniper challenge is basically impossible when you compare it to the medic challenge (seriously? 4 headshots in 4 seconds?). Anyways, it's easy to rack up 30+ hours on this before you get bored. Very good game","At first the game is quiet difficult, but after a few hours I managed to fly through levels extremely fast. The reason I gave this game 4 stars is because I frequently find bugs and glitches which ruin the experience, apart from that I would highly recommend this game.",So sometimes free healing stim does no show fix that plz and also make a team game mode where you can work with online people bc sometimes you have no health and there is 7 robots it just more and easier with teammates.
