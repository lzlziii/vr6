Beer Pong Basement,"Experience the classic party game of beer pong in virtual reality! Challenge a friend or practice your skills against a training robot. Play regular beer pong or add some excitement and change things up with an arrangement of items and power-ups. Watch the entire Youtube library, either by yourself or together with friends. Beer Pong Basement has more to offer than beer pong though. Try your luck at the slot machine or the Flappy Cuppy arcade machine to earn credits. Or try to unlock the many different ping pong balls this game has to offer. Bring the party to your headset with Beer Pong Basement!",18+,"Multiplayer, Single User","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Casual, Social",English,0.9.5.3,Jonas Bellmann,Jonas Bellmann,https://sidequestvr.com/app/5185/beer-pong-basement,"Jan 20, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/8273342646071877/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=8273342646071877&r=1, https://jonasbellmann.wixsite.com/beerpongbasement/terms",769.1 MB,"The fact I can play music off of YouTube makes this so much fun. I love all the little side things you can do while someone takes their turn, the different skins for balls, it's all fun","I love this game entirely, everything about this game has not only my attention but some friends as well. However, and I can't speak for everyone that's played this, but I am experiencing some serious glitches. Such as, bounces not registering, and when they do the game takes the same cup, for example. Not sure sure if it's just me but my oculus is up to date but the game does have days where it's super glitchy.","Full Video Review over on my Channel I had a great laugh when i jumped in with my mate. The basement is set out really well with plenty of TV screens where you can put on any youtube video, a Flappy bird clone arcade machine and a slot machine. You can use Readyplayerme Avatars although something is wrong and you dont have any pants We did find a few bugs which i have reported back to the Devs to Fix. The beer pong gameplay works really well and with the added powerups, and collectables makes it a fun game.",A visually interesting and realistic basement.,"If you're looking for a virtual space to hang out with a friend, listen to YouTube videos and play beer pong this is the game for you! Gameplay is smooth I don't get the nauseated feeling when moving around like some games I've played, secret pong balls to find to add to your collection, mini games to keep you entertained when you're waiting for your friend and the ability to sit and watch YouTube with your friend. Can't wait to see what's more to come!"
