Yes please!! this app has amazing venues that transport you to places like the moon and pool party along with great music of different genres and well known DJ’s!! keep it all coming!! My friends have now purchased an oculus just so we can meet in the club and vibes together..,"The app is still in development and is improving on a weekly basis. They are releasing new content, 2 DJs a week now, in their different venues which look amazing. I can't wait to see what the future of this app will look like.",Truly awful,Was so exited to try this app after Trying horizon worlds and sort of have mixed feelings about the app. The set up is kind of clunky such as setting up an avatar i gave up in the end and just kept the avatar i was provided. FIRST room i entered was the time machine and at first glance looked and sounded great the room had about 8 people in it dancing away which was all moves from the avatars selection which was kinda disappointing as would be better if you had control of the avatar like in horizen worlds. i tried to talk to the other clubbers but none responded which made me think they were just bots. so i tried another room but any other room i tried had no sound? all rooms looked great but again just looked like bots . tried again today and went straight to the time machine room and again no sound and glitching which was really disappointing. This app has loads of potential but the issues with sound and glitches and the non social aspect have put me off. i know the app is still in development so hopefully the devs will sort this out.,"Clubmixed are opening up entirely new venues here. the potential for growth is explosive. the Time Machine room I loved most I 4eckon, but hey that's personal choice. There's enough different styles of music across the board to provide something for everyone, although the ability to move between whoever is playing ""live"" now and the rest of the schedule has to be on the Dev list. Overall, a pretty impressive version 10 or whatever it's at. none of this stuff is that easy to implement and everyone has a next thing they want included. For me, all that's really missing is some more users.... The future is here, now, in your house, on your head......"
