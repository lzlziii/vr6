The game is good but it would be way better if they added that! I would change my stars to 5 if they added that.,"➡️ lin(c)tr(DOT)ee/walidddd This game is truly the best VR fighting game! In addition, depending on the character you select there will be different abilities like becoming an ice man to resist the enemy's blow. There are several combos to learn to eliminate the enemy as quickly as possible. You must also pay attention to the environment where you are, sometimes even a plate can be used as weapons I sincerely recommend this game. It's a sporting game that will require energy. Be careful that nothing is close to you! ( REPLACE c WITH A k ) ( REPLACE DOT WITH A . ) ➡️ lin(c)tr(DOT)ee/walidddd","Update: I finally figured out what bothers me. I watched a youtuber play the PCVR version of this. The enemy closed in, but did actual attacks, like a punch or chop, that the youtuber could then block or sweep out of tge way before striking. In the quest version, enemies don't do that. They take a stance, then just come at you like that. Then it's as if they change stance while hugging you, and magically hit you. Or, they punch at you from 10'away, and charge you like their fist is a battering ram. Basically, the opponent AI in the quest version is bad. My vision says I got struck in the face, but I never see the opponenr actually strike my face. All I see is them holding their stance and changing to a different stance when near me. So, either some action frames are missing, or the AI has been programmed to cheat and magically hit you, or something. The quest version just needs work. I can play Thrill of the Figjt, gornetc, and see attacks coming and block. But I struggle to block in this game, bc I can't tell when someone is attacking. Holding a stance abd rushing you is lazy. Make the enemy ai actually fight. Old: Just got it. Game is really fun. But the hit detection just seems a bit random. I fought three ninjas. I punched in spots they were open. Didn't register sometimes. So, sort of turned into a slap fight. Figured maybe it was bc 3 on 1 chaos. Fight next guy who's 1 v 1. He guards his chest a lot. A close in and have a clean opening to punch his head. Doesn't register sometimes. He starts doing some wind up move sideways. His stomach is open. I use my left arm to guard and punch his stomach. Again, doesn't register sometimes. Basically seems like opponents get into some kind of 100% invulnerable mode every now and then. Meanwhile, their arms go past your blocks and hit. It's like my forearm isn't able to block, which is weird. I got a decent work out just farting around in the first areas, but I feel too much work was put into minor things like being able to eye poke someone when the major things like hit and block detection are still sketchy.","This is one of the more replayable games out there. The game could be a little more polished with hit detection and blocking. There were times that I’d block a punch and still take damage, but it’d happened very rarely. Other than that the game is great, combat, opponents diversity and play styles are extremely accurate, and might I say this game is bit of a work out. Overall, might be the best hand to hand fighter.","This is, HANDS DOWN, the BEST, most polished, most realistic fighting game on Oculus, and it’s not even on the main store! How is that even possible? It’s ridiculously big, offering seemingly endless amounts of fighters to play as…. Each with there own special moves and fighting style. The fighters are all based on real life people or movies, like Bruce Lee. The physics in this game are as close to flawless as you can get with Quest 2 technology. This developer really stretched the Quest 2 to its limit. Read the reviews and you’ll notice it’s not just a bunch of normal 5 star reviews…. They’re GLOWING reviews! Everyone seems to love it, and so do I! Stop reading reviews and just buy it. You won’t be sorry. It’s as close to VR Mortal Kombat as you’ll ever get"
