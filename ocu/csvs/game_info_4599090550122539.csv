ALTAIR BREAKER,"THE WORLD OF ALTAIR Set on the floating island of Vastus Isle, once a magic workshop now in ruins and exploited to run AI experiments.

Experience a wide range of attacks only possible in the VR world, like Shockwaves and Surge Mode. USER-FRIENDLY UI A simplified and intuitive UI was developed to increase the sense of VR and not interrupt the game flow. The Tablet will be your main hub to change equipment, check your status and more. CO-OP MULTIPLAYER Team up with other 3 players from around the world and take on enemies together.

All day long and when you try to get closer they just Teleport away, then once they FINALLY attack you just get one hitted. Now besides the infinite amount of backing up. The projectiles... yea honestly they just suck. The only way to counter them is with a shield and for the wide majority of players, including me, we use two handed weapons so a shield is basically obsolete a cool counter would be like powers that help defend against the projectiles like a blocking mechanism like the shield. But other than the AI the games great the people are nice the sword fighting is good and I like the leveling up system. So yeah that's basically it","This game is amazing to play but if I could say something tho the rewards you receive at the end of each quest could be better and could do with some more add ons. They got to upgrade it with a lounge or meeting place with an endless floor quest where you have to get as far as possible, I mean that would top the game to elite but as it is now it's truly a well made game","i wish i could get into this game seeing how they made swords of gargantua but honestly swords of gargantua was much more fun to play, this game just doesnt feel good or fluent i didnt out much time into it since i wasnt enjoying it and i put too much time into it to get a refund, the level designs are alright i dont like having to run all over the map to kill a few enemies for more to spawn far away makes grinding annoying, every time i try to counter an enemy i notice that sometimes their blade goes through my greatsword and hits me, i wouldnt mind grinding a million coins for the cooler looking weapons but like i said running around the map for a few coins isnt exactly encouraging for grinding, the final boss i keep killing is so much easier than gargantua which is nice but also kinda disappointing since its too easy to kill, thats my honest review of the game i'll come back later once i see some changes but for now game is just meh","- 4 different levels only - Buggy weapons little variety - Buggy enemy AI that falls off edges on its own and ports back unpredictably - Many reused assets from another 2 year old game (Swords Of Gargantua). Even the starter weapon is straight up the sword you start playing with in that 2 year old game. I had high hopes for the makers of Swords Of Gargantua but in the end all I am left with is the gnawing suspicion that the reason SoG was discontinued as a game right before Altairâ€™s launch is that it is in fact a much worse version of the game. In short, this game is not a good return on investment.","1 this game has been out for a while now and has barely addressed any of the issues people are having with this game, swords of gargantua was 1000 times better than this just with weapon physics alone and its near impossibleto have fun on multi-player {or even playing solo for that matter} with how stupideasy it is, the ONLY thing this game has going for it is the launch attacks but this game has been nothing but a disappointment in my eyes And 2 they literally disconnected a game that they made that was 1000 times better {rip swords of gargantua} and now it is LITERALLY unplayable even if you're trying to play SOLO now I could understand disconnecting the multi-player aspect but discontinuing the game COMPLETELY is just bullsh!t, once they make a new game they're undoubtedly gonna put all their ""efforts"" into that one just as they did for this one so please do NOT buy this game, it's not nearly as fun as it might look and they do NOT care about the people who play their games"
