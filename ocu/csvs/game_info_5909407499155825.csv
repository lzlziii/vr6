I was addicted to the my little universe game on mobile and this is the vr version of that. It’s fun, addictive and entertaining. I did encounter a bug where I wasn’t able to collect the items but going to main menu fixed that. It would be nice if we have multiple tools like a axe for trees and a pickaxe for stone, but still even without that it is really fun.",I love this game so much it has every thing it needs except for the fact that it is very short I beat the game under 30 minutes once the game has is longer or just adding mor worlds/levels right now it is a. 9/10 once it gets at least 2 or3 mor levels it will be a 10/10 even tho it is a short game I still highly recommend edit for got to mention it is 10 times better than the mobile game this game has a lot of potential the day I see it on the oculus store I will try to get it but I will get to the day I see it if it is free,"I'd leave a higher review, but I didn't get to experience much of the game. As a left handed person holding the sword in my right hand felt really unnatural. And settings had no way to change it.","Simple resource farming game. Would be helpful if it told you the main objective (ex, is there a purpose to building out the world in a specific fashion, or do all possible ways work equally well in the end?). Discovered there is an inventory counter by accident by looking at my left palm in the middle of the game. Grasping the sword for long periods of time was actually uncomfortable, wish it had the option to automatically hold on, and to swap dominant hands. Graphics are nice. Looking forward to seeing what this game grows up to be.",Nice simple and effective graphics but the game is too easy. The enemy are no challenge as they can be killed from a distance.
