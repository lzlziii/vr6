Phusicos VR,"PHUSICOS-VR takes you to sites around Europe where various nature-based solutions can be used to mitigate natural hazards, including floods, agricultural run-off, rock falls and avalanches. Nature-based solutions are sustainable, green solutions which increase safety while also promoting biodiversity and provide other co-benefits compared to more traditional civil engineering measures. This is becoming increasingly important in a climate adaptation perspective. This game currently shows a diverse range of nature-based solutions in Norway, Italy, France and Spain, and is designed so that additional examples can be added in the future. Our ambition is to educate and inspire our users about nature-based solutions, and to empower politicians, planning authorities and other decision-makers to help make these sustainable solutions a preferred choice for managing natural hazards.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Educational, Exploration, Simulation",English,1.0.0,Phusicos,Phusicos,http://phusicos.eu/,"Jan 21, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3676519892468339/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3676519892468339&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cDBNKAGQz1AfBMiCEC485hCdsDTJMr4tu4HAP7xKFfY/edit",424.9 MB,This is a fantastic experience!
