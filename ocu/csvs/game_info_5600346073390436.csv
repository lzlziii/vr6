First Resort (Early Access),"First Resort is game built for your mental wellness, free in the U.S. for the Early Access period. You arrive at a beautiful lake house retreat, joined by Ari, your quirky guide and companion. Like many others before you, you process thoughts, feelings, and experiences and learn new skills to make you better equipped for real life. During your stay, you journey through chapters that turn cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles into embodied experiences. You physically interact with CBT techniques at First Resort; mounting your values on the wall, practicing mindfulness in soothing environments, and holding and restructuring your thoughts in your hands. Playing First Resort helps you engage in healthy practices to manage worry, stress, and sadness. You may learn to calm your mind. You may decide it’s finally time to do that bucket list item or make friends with someone new. With First Resort, you play for real life.

There are still some bugs and glitches here and there - but the support team is seriously *on it* - I've never seen quicker responses to issues that come up. I think this must be a real passion project for them. I'm excited to see how First Resort grows and develops, and hopeful that I will learn some great skills and acquire tools I can use in my day to day life along the way.","I saw an ad for First Resort on Reddit and decided to check it out. It is current in Early Access, which means there could be some bugs and glitches along the way, but it also means that it's currently free to use (in the future it will almost certainly be a one-time purchase or monthly subscription). The app uses Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help you through your mental health journey. Spread out across 19 chapters (I think - I'm only on Chapter 11), there is a variety of locations and activities to keep you busy. Most chapters have a short (3-8 minute) video, along with an interactive exercise of some kind, such as goal setting, identifying cognitive distortions, and determining your values. There is an area in the virtual lake house where you can create and modify your avatar, as well as change the color of Ari, your robot companion/guide. There are locations for mindfulness activities, so you can get in touch with your thoughts and feelings. I have found this app to be super-helpful and recommend it to anyone who experiences mental health struggles!",I would recommend this to anyone who was maybe not ao sure about seeing a real person for some help with things we all struggle with on our lives,"So often our mental health takes a backseat until we are having problems, and sometimes it continues to take a backseat even then. Many virtual options have been created as of late to give people more flexibility to care for their mental well-being in a way that works best for them, but the options for virtual reality have been very limited, and of the few options out there, almost all of them centered around meditation. In fact, I can only think of one other app that isn’t just meditation based besides First Resort. That said, this is a wonderful app! First Resort isn’t about meditation, although there are meditation modules built in, this is an app that focuses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. The sessions are the perfect length to learn and practice without feeling overwhelmed. A foundation is established upon which you can build, and the companion app allows for continuous access even when you’re not in vr. I encountered a little glitch and contacted support for help, and I was blown away by how responsive the team was. They even arranged a Zoom call to assist me with the problem I was having, and they did it in less than a day of me reaching out. Now, I don’t expect that to happen all the time, but it showed me how much the team cares about this product and the people who are using it. I’m giving this a five star rating not because it’s perfect, but because of the attention to detail, and the willingness of the team to help and receive feedback that they take to heart. This app is amazing and has so much potential to become even better. I look forward to seeing First Resort grow and pros￼per, and I feel grateful to know that I am able to be a part of that journey while strengthening myself. Thanks First Resort!",I think the potential is here for this to be a great mental health tool for people who don’t like the idea of or have the means for seeing an in-person counselor. There are some very handy tools to help sort through and reframe thoughts that are helpful or harmful. There is room for improvement for interacting with the environment. I find it a little difficult to move through the space easily and without glitches. The garden seems to be particularly hard to use. It seems like this is being actively addressed by the developers and I am sure the final version will be much better.
