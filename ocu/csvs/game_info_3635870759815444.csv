Love the custom feature that lets you create your own workout. Would like to see more routines as well as the ""reverse"" workout. Arm swings only go in one direction...I manually do it but it would be nice for the program to mirror that. Nice job devs!","One of the best games you could get for a workout, this app focuses on getting you moving and giving you a balanced workout. It is a very active game. I recommend this game who want to lose weight and do a workout","I love this game! I‚Äôve been looking for a REAL workout. I love that that this has cardio,leg, arm, and core workouts. I never thought I‚Äôd be able to do jumping jacks, burpees, crunches, and push ups in VR! I also enjoy being able to make custom workouts. Please don‚Äôt let us down and become subscription based like all the other apps!ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ",A brilliant game that just doesn't focus on cardio! As a personal trainer in lockdown it's good to find a way of keeping up my strength while doing something I enjoy as a hobby. Definitely the best game to get on app lab now and there are many updates coming in the future! It definitely offers accountability and makes you want to go back day after day to improve yourself especially in the difficult times we find ourselves in.,This is the best app I've bought in VR and I am so much looking forward to more updates and improvements of the environment and some minor other stuff! Awesome work! Thank you for making me healthier!
