Much like my yelp profile I believe my words can impact someones job/future, and for that reason you must really impress me or terribly disappoint to receive my review. So here it isâ€¦ To find a racing game in VR that gives you a real world view without getting you sick is hard to do, but this game has done it. From the vibration levels to mechanics this game is a GEM! I have read reviews about the spin outs and crashes, well let me tell you I experienced it aswell. Untill I started using my brake, watch the other drivers, chose to take an outside corner, waited till lap 3 to pass anyone. This is the first racing game where the strategy and defensive drive really put you in the action. I felt myself drift from reality and into that drivers seat simply because of how hard I need to concentrate and cosistantly focus from start to finish. I can not wait to see what this would be like in multiplayer, and look forward to more from this incredible development team. Your doing an amazing job!",The driving is okay. An extremely annoying thing was that the drift was cranked up to the maximum. Another problem is that the bots are extremely strong and can make you crash if they bump into you.,"the first choice car, not a cute and slow car select kart race kart racing, more people will be able to understand the appeal of this game.","I originally purchased Grid Legends, for the purpose of acclimatising to virtual racing and conquering motion sickness. After trying this game though, I've requested a refund on GL. Really liking the virtual steering wheel, which makes the driving process much smoother, and realistic. And the install space of 645MB is a huge improvement on the 30GB required fire GL. The home screen environment is also nicely done. Very impressive demo and well done to the game developer!"
