Updating to 5-stars. Graphics are good but I'd rather watch a movie. Game play should flow well and physics should be precise for me to be able to swing the arms and land the shots precisely. Its just not there. First Person Tennis is superior to this game.,"This game is honestly going to be a blast, from the way every shot feels coming off your racket, to the character customization, to the wide array of courts available itâ€™s a must buy for anyone looking for a new VR tennis experience!",I found tennis league vr a while ago and played it with my friends and it was a blast !!! I canâ€™t wait for the full game !! I was a little disappointed when I couldnâ€™t play online on the demo anymore but then I saw that the full game was coming out !! Do we have any idea how much itâ€™ll be ? Canâ€™t wait !!,"I need this game. Is more better than the other tennis game in Meta Store. I love your game but is only a demo. When? I hate play again and again exhibition. I want more places, players and a carreer mode. For me is the best tennis game","Based on the demo this game has the potential to be an amazing time killer. Graphically it's functional, nothing too flashy but everything seems solid and well rendered. The physics seem spot on, with the ability to put spin on the ball. The controls seem very intuitive as you would imagine and the teleport movement works extremely well. Very interested to see how this plays against other people."
