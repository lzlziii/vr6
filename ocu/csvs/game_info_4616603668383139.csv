It is a great app with a lot of great information and some practice exams. I wish there would be more apps so sophisticated like this that are free or only a few euros to integrate into the biology/science curriculum.,"It teaches about the full anatomy of the heart and explains how issues like tachycardia, hypotension, and heart murmurs can occur. It stops just short of how to read EKGs and more complex stuff, but the whole experience was bug-free and extremely educational; everyone should try this once, and it's now on my show-to-every-VR-newbie list. It only had two problems: the speaker said ""pulmonic"" despite the text saying ""pulmonary"" at one point, and the end exam seemed to have terms that were never mentioned anywhere else. These are minor issues overall, though.","Honestly, such a great job! Amazing! As someone who used to be in Med School, i wish in the future we could apps like this all the time! This is the future of education!",Wow this was a pleasant surprise. Didn't know what to expect but was both graphicly and presentation wise excellent. Great overview for Middle/High school or beginner college student overview of cardiac anatomy and function.,"Immersive, engaging, instructional. Simple, elegant and functional. Great job!"
