Also I see the leader board,someone shot 198?? Who we got on here? George Digweed and Ed Solomons ? Interested to know how someone hits 198 ?",Chat me for a c0de for m0ney off! My favorite game on oculus and honestly worth buying the oculus just for this. Incredibly realistic and can be used for real life practice. Lots of game modes and gun modifications. Multiplayer is amazing as well.,I love this game and I think it has so much more potential. Hey developers do you thing you could add a pack for rough shooting? So basically walking through a field with a dog and flushing pheasants and qauil rather than just flushing qauil,"Great game but I have my own gunstock, will the devs be adding a feature similar to onward where we can calibrate with gunstocks by making adjustments with the thumbsticks instead of numbers. Thanks","Unless you're extremely wealthy, you probably can't train in every area of shotguing whenever you want. Is it a perfect 1 to 1 training device? No, it can't be, but for VR, this is extremely useful, and I would recommend not only this game but also the meta quest just to get this game."
