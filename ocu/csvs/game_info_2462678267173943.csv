I hoped it would not be a cheesy game. My expectations were high. Walkabout was walk-above my expectations. My lovely bride of 35 years died of Covid in January of 21. I bought Oculous as sort of therapy. Not having played video games since Atari days, it blew my mind. The sets, adventure, and music continues to help me through the grieving process. I have all the courses, balls, and putters(having acquired Laser Lair putter tonight 7-23). I introduced walkabout to some family and friends. We play practically every night of the week. Thank you for helping me through creators.","The only thing I would like to see is the choice of the game you want to play. I would like to choose 2,3,4,5 players and then wait for the other random players to join. Now we only have a quick random match with one person, only 9 holes, always easy mode, and usually random courses are very repetitive… I really hope that this will be implemented in the future… And no, I don’t want to use Discord to find my game, it is much more convenient to have in-game options for this…",I've got every version they have I love it 64 years old play with my other friend and we laugh and have a great time they're all over America and we have a great time playing I just wish you'd come out more new games they're fantastic can't say anything else but hey look for mine I'd love to play with you and one more thing go Trump we need you,"h t t p s : / / b i o , l i n k / j o e s w a n s o n 2 Replace comma with dot, remove spaces, then paste into browser for 25 percent off! Enjoy! This is a great game to come home to after a long day and unwind. Also is great fun to get some friends and play this. This is a game I think any VR owner could enjoy at one time or another, would 100 percent recommend.","This game is as perfect as a game can be. Beautiful, relaxing, an ideal combination of skill and silliness that is great for connecting with distant friends. Friendly community. The environments are cartoony but so well-done and well-integrated with the sound effects (I turn off the music) that they actually produce the same feelings I get when I'm outside on a nice day. This was critical during the pandemic and great on a cold day or when I am feeling kinda blah. I am so happy to shovel money at their DLC maps, too. So much love was put into this game. For reduced price on this and more, see my username."
