Working your way through the achievements unlocks different skins and hats for the kitty (as well as different drumsticks with which to play), so you get fitness benefits and get to dress up a virtual cat. However, some of the achievements are confusing like passing all maps on easyand playing the drums in the drum room. I passed all tracks marked as easy at 1.0 speed but not all tracks have an easy level (some start at normal or hard), so I canâ€™t seem to get the achievement, and I donâ€™t see any drum room either, so itâ€™s frustrating. And then thereâ€™s one for playing 3 hours consecutively, which doesnâ€™t seem possible for a headset with a two hour battery life. Movement wise itâ€™s not too natural hitting drums at some high angles but itâ€™s fairly low impact on the wrists and has a fair number of obstacles to get your squats in. Music is pretty bouncy so it generally feels pretty fun to play especially with the cute cat running alongside.","Fellow IIDX player told me about this and if it weren't for him I would have never discovered this hidden gem (or would simply ignore it because neither the content from the game nor the description of it seems 'interesting'). This game is done certainly by rhythm game players that understand what players want from the game. Great mechanics and scoring system. After the game rework it's much smoother (even though it means some maps are less playable.) The game has nice visuals both more complex and more simple ones, a lot of customization, quality of life features, settings for speed, offset, controllers, hit sounds etc. You can simply play the way you want! There's many songs already which are quite varied (including some Camellia boss songs). But you can also download community maps to music that you can freely (legally) map. As for the maps they are very hit or miss but there are certain mappers that show the potential the game has. It has a great potential and I hope more mappers will experiment and take it to the next level. Some create very good maps that will make your whole body ache afterwards. I can highly recommend this game to anyone who wants some workout and challenge. Give it a chance!","Won this game in a contest, but wow didn't know it was this good....ended up getting it on PCvr. Worth it","The levels start in the highest possible difficulty per default. And the UI is so overloaded that I didn't found out how to change the difficulty at all. So my first impression was that this game is unplayable. Even with speed set down to 0.5x it was to much for me and I play BS in Expert+. If not for a friend who told me where I can adjust that I would have already deleted this game. Yes that was really frustrating. IMO the tutorial is dead wrong to tell you to not use your wrists - especially regarding the default difficulty is set to max - so better not listen to this ""advice"" and don't hurt yourself. And dear developers it's valid to use wrists as every fancer would do. Our shoulders aren't meant to move at high speeds that are required for such type of game. You simply can't control them enough and this leads to injury. But a warmup is always a good idea no matter your playing style. And of cause one doesn't need to use wrist style when something's easy. I corrected my review to take out a bit of the acid as I realized that it was a bit to much and I actually like the game. BTW. Don't set the defaults to the easiest possible. This is way to easy and not good for presentation as there isn't enough going on. Better choose the second or third grade similar to BS where they defaulted levels to normal and not the easy setting.",Could you fix the slight stuttering on the screen when you select your music? It happens when previewing a song? Do that and this will easily be a five star game. Its great! Oh and an option to remove the cat!! Love the workouts but not a cat person ðŸ¤£ Keep up the great work!!
