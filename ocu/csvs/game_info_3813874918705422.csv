The Fun Facts are a great addition. I am confused about the additional play game that shows up when you find bonus words, though.","This is a typical word search, which I’ve always loved, but this game you are so close to the board it’s hard to find the words and you get neck fatigue. There should be some way to move backward or forward depending on each person’s needs. You’re allowed to turn your head with the controls but not closer or further away. I’d give 5 stars if they fixed this issue.","Each time you find a word, there is a small fact about that word. I love it.",Looks cute. Sometimes there's stutter.,I like it can you buy it
