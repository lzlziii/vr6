I just think that the graphics need to be improved to make it more realistic and I found it difficult to play skee ball and basketball although it was fun trying.,This can be a fun app but need adjustments and update. Both skeeball and basketball very difficult to play well in the current version. Please update. For skeeball the front glass panel should be adjusted or removed as it interferes with the proper ball roll.
