It's annoying when I get interrupted by the messages and updates on how my city is doing. 2. Don't like the way your able to move around. There's no forward locomotion only grab and drag. Would be great if devs made a countryside version with mountains and roads you can make that are winding and farms, gardens, little towns. That I'd love more than this. I love my island. I made lots of green spaces and parks. I'm pretty impressed by my little city! And if you zoom up high enough there's a ufo. Love the hot air balloons and watching the people go about their day in the city I made for them. Quite a challenge and I had to bulldoze a lot and redo because it's a learning experience to get roads and flow of traffic good. Setting up neighborhoods that are interesting and have stores nearby. I even have an avenue of cherry blossom trees. Love the UFO! Hilarious how it comes down and sucks up a person. I think you need to add dogs and cats. Great game, def get it people.","It's an awesome game, you could spend hours non stop, and it's much more enjoyable and interactive than previous versions. However, though it is early stages of development, there is no ""Day'n'Night"" feature. The day time stays on the entire time, shining very brightly, it never sets over the horizon or rises above. Now that wouldn't be terrible, except, overtime the sheer brightness of the sky gets pretty blinding and overwhelming not gonna lie. Request to make a feature in sandbox mode/ campaign mode (for future updates) where you can • Visit other islands. Buy, sell & Travel to other players Islands & cities. Inspiring others by sharing your City with other players. Example, ""Airport Use is fast travel to other islands and cities. • Change the weather. Set indefinitely • Adjust the time of day. (optional to remain eg Sunset All day, Night All day • Increase graphics. Comparable to Sim's city (but smooth high fps). The graphics and details in this game are not very good at all, it would be very nice to see much more detail and a much better look in the next update. (Basically a ""Face-Lift"") • Create an Avatar to live as, inside your city. Living, commuting, working, creating a life artificially, and realistically. Suggest running this feature using the latest Ai personality enhancement technology. • Additional/ More ""Land-Mass"" in Sandbox mode. Not enough space/grids & Increased land capacity to cater for growing population & levelling up. • More attractions such as ""Zoo"" Train Station"" ""Public transport"" ""Art Gallery"" ""Entertainment Districts"" ""Neon Signing (for Nighttime)"" ""Car-parks"" ""More of, and more appealing attractions/ iconic buildings & Landmarks such as: Skyscrapers, palaces, colossal statues, European Towers landmarks, that focus on Commercial, but mostly Residential boost"" ect • Last one.. request for multi level construction. Or multi plane construction. Increasing and decreasing of land mass height, height change for roads and option to build on cliffs. Ect. These are just some examples, of the amount of enjoyable benefits these programmed features will offer! I'm sure this amazing hard working team will satisfy","This game is definitely one of the best games I have ever played! I just love to sit on the carpet and watch the life in my cozy town. I like the style of the buildings, love the diversity of the tiny people, as well as the diversity of the animations. There are still some surprises that I notice once in a while. Maybe there could be some management system, like upgrading the buildings, own decisions what will be the factories produce (e.g. producing the stones, which are need to build another buildings, rare items to build rare stuff...). I think this feature would made the game even more fun and provide more interaction. Some players may get bored after a while. Overall, the game is perfect for relaxation, has lovely graphics, the control is simple and well thought out.",⢀⡴⠑⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣀⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠸⡇⠀⠿⡀⠀⠀⠀⣀⡴⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠑⢄⣠⠾⠁⣀⣄⡈⠙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⡀⠁⠀⠀⠈⠙⠛⠂⠈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⡿⢿⣆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⢀⡾⣁⣀⠀⠴⠂⠙⣗⡀⠀⢻⣿⣿⠭⢤⣴⣦⣤⣹⠀⠀⠀⢀⢴⣶⣆ ⠀⠀⢀⣾⣿⣿⣿⣷⣮⣽⣾⣿⣥⣴⣿⣿⡿⢂⠔⢚⡿⢿⣿⣦⣴⣾⠁⠸⣼⡿ ⠀⢀⡞⠁⠙⠻⠿⠟⠉⠀⠛⢹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣌⢤⣼⣿⣾⣿⡟⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⣾⣷⣶⠇⠀⠀⣤⣄⣀⡀⠈⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠉⠈⠉⠀⠀⢦⡈⢻⣿⣿⣿⣶⣶⣶⣶⣤⣽⡹⣿⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠲⣽⡻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⣜⣿⣿⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⣷⣶⣮⣭⣽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣈⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠇⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠛⠻⠿⠿⠿⠿⠛⠉,"Honestly I think the category of games for sitting on a couch without having to move too much is heavily lacking. And this game fills that void perfectly. I love just getting back from work or wanting to chill on a weekend with nothing to do but hit up some VR. And this delightful game can keep you entertained for hours! I have noticed a glitch a couple times where when I'm building and if my left hand isn't always in the view, the options window disappears. so I have to look at my left hand and build again (this becomes more apparent when I have to move my head towards the text to read some of the descriptions). So I'm forced to stay very still sometimes when building. Also, the hand tracking on the Quest2 isn't that amazing and glitches sometimes. but again, I'm hoping the Quest3 solves a lot of those worries. Still highly recommend this game!"
