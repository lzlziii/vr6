Puzzling Paths,Build and fix paths across 20 different levels. This game will make you think and push your brain. This is a great brain workout. Can you fix all 20 paths?,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Casual, Puzzle",English,1.0,weird eye studios,Weird Eye Studios,https://sites.google.com/view/weird-eye-studios/puzzling-paths,"Jul 28, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5540694516004792/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5540694516004792&r=1, https://sites.google.com/view/weird-eye-studios/privacy-policy",315.4 MB,"This is a very nice puzzle, it's not too easy (this is a good thing) and it's funny, the graphics are not the best and there are a few imperfections (for ex. sometimes it doesn't recognize the pieces even if they are in the right place and you have to take them out and put it again in the same place before the error signs goes away), but naturally it's worth every cent. I hope to see more games like this.","Works a lot better now. It still jumps a bit and the snapping to place could be better. But Iâ€™ve added a star for the improvement and quick response. Thank you. I tried the game out as I really like puzzle style games. The problem was, the movements are very unstable in the game. It says to hold the table to fix the height, but any ti e I tried, it would jump either to another location or into the game. It would work a lot better if the pieces snapped into place a little easier. When I went to the second level, I would place a piece or two down, and then it would reset back to the beginning. Very frustrating."
