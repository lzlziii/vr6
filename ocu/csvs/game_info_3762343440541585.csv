Tea For God Demo,"Tea For God is a VR adventure that uses impossible spaces with procedural generation to allow players infinite movement within their own room. Customizable gameplay can be anything between a relaxing long walk, an intense arcade shooter (checkpoint based) and a roguelite shooter-explorer. In the distant future, humankind has been united, ruled by God Emperor. Endowed with advanced technology we reached stars, colonised new worlds, went onto endless crusades against myriads of civilisations. Personal tragedies tend to be meaningless against the time. But once in a while, one person may start a fire that can change the fate of the whole universe. A man who lost his family, who holds God Emperor accountable for their death, seeking answers and vengeance, embarks onto his last journey to the place no human has ever left alive, where God Emperor is believed to reside. This is the demo version.

With Playspace Immersion, and Unique AI, this game is a 11/10. The game may be 20 minutes long, but that doesn’t matter because the gameplay is still a lot of fun. Tip for beginners: you can take off the gun on your wrists by grabbing them with your opposite hand.","This game is positively mind-bending and does something that no other game does. The main gimmick of the game is that you don't have your ""standard"" thumb-stick locomotion. So instead you have to PHYSICALLY walk around your playspace however the environment warps around you. And the game has so much sustenance! Different guns with cool robot exoskeletons. Scary electrical robots and little zap doggies, there is a TON to explore in each instance. Seriously, pick this game up now!",This game absolutely thrives in VR. So well executed. You'll think you've teleported into a vast landscape. As an 80s kid this is the kind of game I dreamt of when playing early VR in the 90s. An amazing achievement. Is there a full Quest standalone version of this out the same day as the Steam version on 19th July???? Day 1 purchase for me.
