My friend just flicks his wrist to take his shots and he wins matches against me üòÖ so the experience is completely subjective. But I played golf for years then had to take a few seasons off and when I went back I was terrible! I shot an uncountable score that we ended up recording as a generous 165 üò≥ ... All I did was play some Golf plus in between and the next game I played a month later i shot a 105! Not great, but a vast improvement and more on par with where I was in my game before I stopped. To be clear this is not a golfing SIM it is still a game. And as such it plays as any really good golfgame should; there are tournaments to compete in, new courses being added, modifications you can make to your clubs, multiplayer etc... my one and only complaint is that I would say the cost of each additional course is a little high and the base game only comes with 3 courses. Five would have been a more favourable starting number i think ü§∑ But there are bundles offered regularly and sales on courses you simply choose your purchases wisely. And the game in and of itself has enough going for it that I still gave it 5 stars despite that singular complaint üëçüëç Two thumbs up! Fantastic game!","First off, no this is not real golf. It does however feel and play pretty good. Get a golf club attachment and it's even better. The best thing I can say is that I don't spend half my time looking for balls in the woods. That is a big plus for me. I still slice just like in real golf and I still can't putt. My distances are pretty close to my actual unless I'm playing novice, then I have become pretty good, for days when I don't want to struggle, lol. You can't go wrong with this one.","I never thought playing this game would change how I hit the ball in real life, but after playing a couple weeks of VR golf+ I have truly seen a different in my game in real life. My drive is starting to become more straight as I used to have a problem hitting towards the left. My close game has improved tremendously as well, easily getting to the green and finishing strong putting. The only thing is in VR golf+ the putting is extremely sensitive so be gentle when putting.","Played gold as a junior but not picked up a stick in anger for years. I picked this game up for my meta and I‚Äôm back in love with golf. I cannot believe the realism.I‚Äôm leaning to shape my shots better, cure weaknesses. The ability to hit the range with a training video on the media player is brilliant. All these skills I‚Äôm genuine taking back into real life golf. This is a game changer!","Play golf any weather and stay dry and warm. Great golf game to play with friends or on your own. Also there is the driving range and a topgolf range. You can take a full swing but make sure you can‚Äôt hit anything, like lights. The graphics are very good and you can upgrade your clubs and golf balls."
