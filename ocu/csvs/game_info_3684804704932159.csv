This game is one of a kind. In a gaming system flooded with shooter and combat games with the occasional puzzle game, garden of the sea is a breath of fresh air. This game came out 4 years ago and there is still nothing like it, a cozy gardening sim with a touch of fancy, like stardew valley. It is fun relaxing and cute and I wish there were more cozy games and farmings sims in vr. And agin this game is till my favorite on the quest library 4 years later. I love this game and hope to see more like it soon.","Such a fun game!!! The animals, islands, driving a boat. If you like Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon you will enjoy this. I am addicted. I really hope they keep expanding the game. It would be great to have friends to send letters to, visiting others would be a great feature, more quests. I can see how even if you complete the quests, it’s still fun to get in and tend to the animals and garden and build things, shop and such. So much fun!","l-i-n-k-t-r*e-e/k-e-l-l-0-1-5 (Remove - and add a point instead of a * to get a surprise!) Honestly the best VR game I've tried so far. If you love Animal Crossing and nice, cozy games where you can pet animals, this game is for you. Move at your own pace, grow crops, discover this strange but adorable world. The controls are very intuitive, and it's very easy and soothing to play. Absolutely love it!","Use the link below to get money off this game. Just remove the words ""REMOVE"" and put it all together https://wwwREMOVE oculusREMOVE com/appreREMOVE ferrals/ChaddJ/36848047REMOVE 04932159/?utm_source=2 This game is awesome!! I highly recommend it. I got it because my seven year old daughter really wanted it. It looked pretty good so I got it. She has played it more than me, but I have to admit, it's an extremely well made game. You can basically do whatever you want in an open world. There's so many tasks and accomplishments you can try to get or you can just do your own thing and build gardens on various islands. It's kid friendly which is great! The game is pretty simple, but has enough depth to keep you entertained for hours and hours until the battery dies! This is a very fun game that's low key and engaging. This game and vacation simulator are my daughter's favorite games. She enjoys being able to solve the tasks and explore different islands as well as build things how she wants. Just get the game. It's unique and worth every penny! My only complaint/request for the devs is to have the game save automatically. Or have the option to auto save or not. The reason being is that it was difficult for my daughter to save the game. If you just exit then you'll start back where you last saved. You can load your game. It saves up to three different games, but you have to click save before you exit. The first time my daughter was playing and the batteries died. So it lost her progress. I showed her how to save and to save regularly. I know in vacation simulator it just constantly saves so you get out or it die's and you're right back where you were. This was hard for my daughter to realize but then she got it down to constantly save and it hasn't been an issue. Again, this is a great game that I would highly recommend!",Garden of the sea is a very nice game but it is to hard to find things like when an animal wants something it is very hard to find and there is know one telling you what to do like am I supposed to click this or that and I am on a random island right now but I don’t know what I am supposed to do? Thanks for reading and I tried to keep it short so people can read it and not know what I am saying.
