Wind Wind,"Oh no! Dark Star has cursed the souls of the gentle people of Wind Wind preventing them from ascending to the sky. It’s up to you to guide Joe and Cozy through eight treacherous towers using only your wits as you master the wind to traverse your way up. Once you clear all eight towers Dark Star’s curse will be lifted and the souls of Wind Wind will be free. Beware the minions of Dark Star who have taken positions along your ascent, these foes and their tricks become more formidable as you approach each summit. You will need to employ the unique abilities of both Joe and Cozy to overcome them. Joe has powerful hands for breaking barriers and can also block dangerous laser beams, while Cozy can leap remarkable distances to clear perilous gaps on your journey. As you climb, collect as many souls as you can, they may save you along the way so use them wisely.

The controls could use a little tinkering, help make things more crisp and natural feeling. But the puzzles are perfect. Same with the graphics. “Bocce Time!” Is still my most played but this will come in a close 2nd for at least a month. By the way, love the level lengths! Usually these type of games have shorter levels, but this one really needs the checkpoints (which they give). UPDATE: I was loving this game UNTIL I realized I can’t save my level!? Can’t tell ya how many times I’ve gotten to level 3-4 and decide to exit for the night, come back the next day and forced to start from level 1. I’ve exited the game every way I can think of in order for it to save my spot but to no avail. Until this is fixed, the game is pointless because I can’t get past level 3-4 unless I’m willing to beat the game all in 1 sitting. And my oculus battery doesn’t last nearly long enough for that. I’ll update to 5 stars once I get a reply and fix",바람 불어 움직이는 데다 관성까지 더해져 내 맘대로 움직이기 어려운 것이 남다른 점이면서 재미 포인트. 떨어지면 죽는 게임은 때려 죽여도 하기 싫다는 사람만 아니면 웬만하면 즐길만한 강추 게임. 근데 나만 그런가 이어하기가 안 눌리네 덕분에 첫 판만 세 번째,I was going to make it 4 stars due to the English translations which are awful but I’m fairly sure most games made by English developers butcher foreign language translations often. But I definitely recommend devs get proper translations for English as it’s probably the biggest market for sales for them. On to the good stuff? This is really engaging and interactive and beyond cute. The graphics are stunning. If it weren’t for the translations I’d say this belongs on the official App Store. Great jobs devs,"This game is just amazing! The graphics are really crisp and clear. I didn’t know the Quest 2 was able to output such nice visuals. Great sound and music, easy controls, smooth turning and movement. A lot of puzzling gameplay, just my thing. I also like the diorama story-telling, top-view gameplay and cartoonish art-style. Okay, the english translation is a bit weird.. some sentences I didn’t even understand, but hey.. that’s just an update issue. ;-) One suggestion: an option to reverse the x-axis rotation would be welcome. Overall, I am really impressed. Great game!","This should be on the Oculus store at full price. We need more puzzle platformers like this. Wind Wind feels like Marble Madness meets Carly and the Reaperman. It’s beautiful, polished and has unique mechanics that would only work in VR. Really huge levels that are a genuine challenge without feeling unfair. I believe the only thing holding the game back is its really poor, sometimes confusing English translations of the instructions. If they fix it, I bet they’ll see a Moss level success story."
