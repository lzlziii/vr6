Green Beret,"Green Beret: Rebels Operation is a virtual reality shooting game inspired in the great classic shooters that we have enjoyed so many hours. Play the role of a green beret infiltrated on an island taken by a group of rebel soldiers. Intro: A group of rebel soldiers under Colonel Walker have taken a remote island located in the Pacific Ocean and formed their operations center there. On the island there is an ancient castle that they are using as a base of operations and use their underground dungeons as cells. The only way to enter the island is to be captured. In your mission you have let yourself be captured and you have been locked in one of the castle's cells. Your next mission is to escape from your cell, annihilate all the enemies to end the organization and get away from the island.

Terrible movement and get motion sickness straight on. Also crap holding your guns and terrible magazine loading. The worst app I bought so far.,A great game that reminds you of classic shooters like Wolfenstein or Medal of honor. Good handling of weapons and incredible game mechanics. So far the best shooter I have for my Oculus Quest2.,A solid shooter. Nothing crazy over the top just a nice action packed shooter.,Retro get it 25% off tho.. https://www.oculus.com/appreferrals/jollyjesus/6370622459676794/?utm_source=2
