Basically it comes with 3 tables for the price,each one very colourful with great sounds and effects. I also purchased 3 more tables afterwards. I know many have said this is a bad way for the devs to do things but I don't object to coughing up an extra bit of cash for the effort they clearly put in. So, I'm enjoying it but what about the issues? Well for me the tables are rather over complicated. There are instructions on the internet for what everything does but even trying to understand them blows my mind! One of my additional tables at one point gave me 6 balls to deal with at the same time. Trouble is all I could really do was watch the balls on the flippers and shoot them into God knows where as if I actually looked where I was trying to aim them they would all end up dropping between the flippers. The main problem for me though is a very annoying sticking of the right flipper in the activated position particularly during multiballs. Had my controller inspected and there's nothing wrong with it that would cause this to happen. So all in all it's a pretty good game with a few flaws that just take the edge off it. A sticky flipper and, (for me at least), over complex tables.","a ""must have"" for pinball fans who don't have the means or the space to buy real ones!! I spend hours on it. We still need new tables. Zen Studio: make new tables in 2023 please","You have a knowledged and forward much of this feedback to the developers. I have seen no true response, action plan or updates. Much of the feedback is on point. The title is not priced correctly as well as dlc. There is one review comparing to Starwars pinball. This title is more in line with correct pricing. I own both titles, however, I agree with many reviewers. Would like to see price adjustments and a more Starwars pinball experience for this vr title. Please pass on this feedback , but also have the principle developers respond to these loyal users. These are good vr titles that can be better and move to the best seller list. Thanks",but in VR it's fun üòäü§î‚ú®,"This is worse than ps version you more unlockables far more tables and live events, when I seen the size of the room a thought they might just full it up with tables but only having room for 3 is very poor an cheap, far to much that could have unlockable slots on ps there‚Äôs 5 per table an the start mawra are included instead of so many pinball games, 3 tables on view for that price, still yet to find a good game on this a really thought they would have got switchback vr or until dawn but just let PlayStation have them an buying the os 1 soon. Also noticed thei the battery power wa ant great a would say it is utter crap, half an hour at a time if your lucky. This is just pinball fx and pinball fx3 from consoles and mixed the tables and features, also on ps5 Star Wars is a package for pinball fx and the Star Wars pinball on this has all that pinball fx has on ps5 also released Star Trek table aswell as Williams package, Garfield, zen season 2, marvel season 1 and 2 and a whole load more watching a video on you tube the guys at zen even mention updates for Nintendo switch and all other platforms but not this, very strange, oh and the app itself is free with a cpl of free tables, you pay for the tables so a don‚Äôt see why we have to pay for the app here they seem to have forgot about it or just don‚Äôt care."
