With each frequent update the game gets better and better. Driven is my favorite Race game in all platforms. It's so easy to sit on the sofa and feel more immersive than in my cockpit. Thank You for your great job.",I'm not able to post a link here but if you search Facebook we've created a driven fan page for people to post videos and know who and when people are playing. I hope this is okay to post here! My friends and I love your game! It's seriously the best racing game I've found on VR!! Great work,"This IS the premier driving software experience for the Quest 2! 5.2 Is SHARP and SMOOTH. I love the gloves, I love the sharp textures, super smooth physics, shiny and dull shaders look fantastic. Driving physics are TIGHT, it feels like I'm IN the vehicles glancing out the window to follow the apex is an extremely convincing feeling. I can't wait to share content for the Quest community. We need this great racer. I can't say enough about the improvements to post race and dashboard info. The lighting is awesome, fully immersive. Please remove the distracting music at start line. The Impreza exhaust seems a bit pitched UP, maybe return the grunt.? Tracks are well designed, the assets, scenery, and world animations are quite attractive. I'm reinvigorated by the new content, the effects and intricate tracks are incredibly fun and totally unexpected! Overall graphics are very nice. Sense of speed and handling physics offer an immersive experience. Mirrors, smoke and dirt effects look great. Nice texture works on the mountainsides, the views and skybox are amazing throughout this game. I really like the birds and airship that even makes noises. Engine sounds and reverberations in confined space are exciting and inspiring. The wind blowing in convertible vehicles or undercarriage sounds on dirt is perfect Virtual steering is remarkably well implemented once you get the hang of it, throwing into turns and gently cornering out is a thrill, I'm pushing every turn Please create channels for players to reach out or find other racers for multiplayer in the future.? Too bad the barrels are gone, I appreciate the physics of items and random outcomes they provide Hoping for mixed vehicle/class races in the future. Slipstream works well and improves expected natural feeling of driving at high speed. The truck interior looks fantastic! The 3D carbon texture you are using looks great too. The overall interiors are improving now. I appreciate how fast I can get from powered off device to in a race. I think this is important to keep interest engagement. Thank you so much for providing extended care for this great product I'm so thankful for this hidden gem although I wish it weren't a secret. The price is understated and the developer(s) should be proud of this excellent product.","It is really good racing game. Only question, can you make discord channel for multiplayer and announce it in game ? It would be nice play multiplayer more often. And can we reassign keys ? It would be really nice to change some bindings to personal prefers","What a silly low price for most likely the best racing game for the quest.Graphics first class ,the challenge s are just about right and not out of anyone’s reach. Very very addictive,but learning the mechanics of the game has priority..otherwise your just crash and crash…well done the Devs."
