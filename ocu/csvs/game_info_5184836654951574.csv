If you do that before you start the campaign release a “im an OG” badge in the shop so the OG’s could be recognized and respected.,It’s not bad but I feel like there is already another robot copy of this it’s just this one is better but it’s so confusing bc it’s super overrated and I feel like all the comments are fake and they are all talk and at the end of the day they both kinda suck,More people need to play dis game it is very fun with a full lobby,I love robots and gorilla tag so this is the perfect match for me. I believe this will be the best gorilla tag fan game ever one day!
