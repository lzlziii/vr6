I don't believe each environment has a unique meditation narration, although I might be wrong. The app is definitely still in beta--it takes a while to load, there's no obvious menu screen, no tutorial, and the meditation scripts seem lifted from a phone app. That said, the new content is impressive. If you're new to meditation, I'd recommend using a more comprehensive, structured, and polished app to acquaint yourself with fundamentals. If you already meditate, then I 100% recommend trying Mediana--even in its current beta state. The visuals are hypnotic and the narration talent is solid. I'm looking forward to the finished product. Original Review: I'm very interested in (meditation) apps that employ elements such as form constants, entrainment, binaural audio, etc. This app uses uniform hyperbolic tiling (or something similar) along with other stimuli to help shift your consciousness. The script, narration, and visuals are executed well (and effectively). The ONLY reason I'm removing 2 Stars is the store page for the app shows a variety of visuals, suggesting more content that doesn't currently exist in the app and this is misleading. To be clear: the single scenario currently included is expertly done and worth your time. My (current) rating stems from confusion--the app doesn't have a menu to select other scenarios or text explaining WHY the advertised scenarios are missing. Perhaps they're under construction? Perhaps this is a free demo, and other scenarios will be behind a paywall? I was really confused because the video for the app shows a wide variety of content, whereas the app seems to be limited to a single 10-minute scenario. I'm happy to revise my rating once the developer clarifies (in-app) what is going on with missing scenarios. As it currently stands, this app has a single, ~10-minute experience that is very well done.","This app transported me to a series of surreal landscapes featuring mesmerizing colors, shapes, and sounds. The VR experience was incredibly immersive, and it was a great escape from the stress of daily life. The guided meditations were easy to follow and helped me to focus on the present moment, I felt more relaxed and calm after using the app. I highly recommend this app to anyone looking for a unique and effective virtual reality relaxation experience.",Wow! App offers travel through a magnetic scene from the Interstellar movie!
