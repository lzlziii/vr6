Cartridge '81,"Do you remember when video games were all about blasting meaningless, colorful pixels? Now you can truly relive that joyful era in VR. In the rail shooter Cartridge ’81 you travel over a 10-mile-long, winding computer generated grid. Your mission is to shoot as many pixelated creatures as you can – or just enjoy the ride and the soundtrack. Nothing can harm you. Like in the classic video games, Cartridge '81 has three end-of-level bosses that you might have to meet a few times to figure out. The high score list only allows three initials and local memory storage like yesteryear. Internet? What’s that? Features: - Fun and casual shooting for everyone. - Only pixels getting hurt. - 10-mile-long, colorful and thrilling track. - Acceleration balanced to avoid motion sickness. - No automatic rotation for the same reason. - No Internet required.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Arcade, Casual, Shooter",English,1.0.1,Punky Pixels,Punky Pixels,https://cartridge81.com/,"Jan 7, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4500006453452515/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4500006453452515&r=1, https://cartridge81.com/privacy-policy/",182.7 MB,"This game really surprised me. The graphics and feeling you get while playing it is like you are trapped inside a game from the 1980s. I have not played any other game that gives me the kind of nostalgic feelings I get with this game. The music is also very good and fits well with the whole experience. The only downside is that it is quite short and you can't die in the game, so there is a lack of tension.","I love this game. Makes me wonder why there's so few really fun shooters out there. Where most vr shooters over do it to the point of absurdity this game finds great enjoyment in simplicity. The gun is fun to use and the projectile round is super satisfying to land a shot with. Enemies are pretty diverse and fun. Music and aesthetics are euphoric. My criticisms are... Despite the claim of no motion sickness, it's still totally possible to feel queezy in this game Game makes use of 360 degree turn radius is a way that I feel is unnecessary for most games. Wish I could play without using my neck or back.","Best game ever! Love this arcade shooter, very cheap!","I am so glad I found this game. This is a stellar experience! It's like playing Galaga and Space Invaders in 3D all around you. The graphics are super bright and have that neon industrial look to it. The characters appear in front and behind you and fly over you so you are moving all around. And the soundtrack of the 80s synthesizer techno vibe that comes from it really puts you in the zone to shoot these arcade enemies! I would highly highly recommend this to any 80s arcade gamer and anyone that enjoys that vibe you get from the 80s. Hard to describe but it is just awesome. If there is ever another game like this made by these guys I will absolutely be buying it! This is one of the best experiences I have had in VR honestly aside from Super Hot. It's just so immersive! One question for the developers, what do you have to do to beat the Area 2 boss (spider)? I'm shooting the legs but it moves so dang rapidly I can't aim at it enough to kill it and unlock Area 3!","I truly love this game and those of a certain age will get it 100%. Who would have thought back in the 80's that one day in the future you will put inside Space Invaders/Galaxian. Play this 3 times a day at least. Would totally recommend this game to anyone especially those that played Invaders back in the 80's. Updates please Devs!, or maybe another game of a similar theme!..Top Notch Devs!"
