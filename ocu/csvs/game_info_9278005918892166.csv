If anyone knows how to help, please do",Amazing tbh,"if i need to pay 10 dollars a month to keep my games, and i have to use tokens to buy the games, thats not even a money grab thats a money steal, i thought that all i have to do is get the game installed and thats it, but 10 dollars a month plus extra money on tokens to buy games is just stealing money, so maybe what would make it better is disable the whole “tokens for time” thing, its already enough that i have to use tokens to get the games, plus also take away the “10 dollars a month to keep the game” because thats just a lil extra(or at least lower the price a little bit)"
