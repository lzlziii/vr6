Time Patrol on Steam is an ok one, and this one is almost ok, but needs some love. First the good: it very closely follows the PB template. Now the less good: the gun has no animation or heft to the shooting, making it unsatisfying. There's poor visual registration of shots â€” in PB, your loud, visible misses are a crucial quick calibration mechanic. The difficulty spikes can be unforgiving, and there's a lack of charm to the presentation. Levels like the space junk level can be entirely broken by simply not launching the type of item you're meant to shoot. It feels like an alpha proving that the engine works, rather than a functioning game. But I'm not going to refund because it's early days and could transform into something much more polished and satisfying. Which would probably sell very well.",This game is tremendous fun for the entire family. Easy to pick up and intuitive to play. If you like arcade style gallery games and/or boardwalk shooting galleries you will love Trigger Warning!
