I wrote a recent one star review as I hit a bug that would not allow me to continue the game. The developers have since made contact and fixed the problem. I have notified them of several other bugs and they have let me know they have confirmed the issues raised and are working to fix these. I have been very impressed with their communication and the rapid response and fixes. This game may not appeal to everyone but it is a pretty good game. I will continue playing.,I got this game because I love working on cars and when I can’t work on real cars I love to hop on my quest and work on virtual ones there’s definitely some weird quirks the game has but other than that it’s a great game I recommend to any mechanic or car enthusiast as it can be fun to those who know a fair bit about cars,"It would be fun if I was an actual mechanic who knew how to dismantle a car, fix it and put it all back together but guess what. I’m not. The tutorial is so f***ing confusing I wanted to kill myself aster trying to figure it out. I wish I had a timer but I apparently spent two hours figuring the “basics” and now cannot refund the game. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.","This game has good attention to details and it’s relatively realistic. As a person who’s starting to work on cars it’s great for learning some basics and getting experience. You’ll have to go on YouTube and google to learn how to do a bunch of these jobs though. Which is good learning. However. The tablet in this game makes my stomach turn. It’s so slow to respond, It’s glitchy. The keyboard is slow and inaccurate. When enlarged my clicks don’t register. It randomly freezes and shuts down when in the part shop. It’s making me go crazy. If this was fixed the game would be a 5.","This game keeps glitching. I got pretty far on it and come to find out the car is off the lift and over by the back door with no tires on it I can’t bend down to put the tires on. It won’t let me put the car back onto the lift it’s messed up. It keeps glitching on me Word to the wise. If you think you’re going to get far on this game, you can forget that."
