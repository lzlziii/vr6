This is simply the best vr cooking game I have ever played to date. The graphics are awesome the gameplay mechanics are superb just make sure you chop things slow haha The modes are great the design is perfect and there is some great humour please get this on the main store so others can enjoy it to,"This is a pretty great cooking game. I love that it gives instructions as you play. As others have mentioned, how to grab/slice things takes practice. If you slice too fast, your ingredients go flying! The campaign is fun and ramps up at a nice speed for learning. Mostly, I want a way to play other people.","** UPDATED REVIEW ** I previously gave the game 5 stars but wanted to amend my review to add a few more points to help those who may be thinking of purchasing it. I purchased and have played this game since the release date and I'm still loving it! What is brilliant is the challenging environments in each wave that you play. To name a few, challenges include serving as many customers as you can during a storm, zero effect gravity, birds stealing food when cooking etcâ€¦ Furthermore, I really like the different characters such as the crying baby and you have to hurry up and give it ice-cream so it will stop crying and to stop customers from leaving lol! Enjoyable single player game. There are over 80 variety of dishes. Great amount of replayability. You can play arcade and campaign modes, casual and heroic difficulty. The boss battles are so much fun!!! The graphics are very good and the game plays smoothly no glitches. What is incredible is that the game is created by a 2 persons team. If you are looking for a different cooking game with unique challenges this is the game for you. I highly recommend it!!!","I love this game, it is very realistic and a true simulation to the real thing. It is challenging but yet exciting. I hate cooking in real life but for some reason love cooking in VR. Games like this keeps my VR addiction going.","So in short the game is awesome. Just TWO things id like changed - 1. The background ruins the view and breaks the immersion because of it clearly being a kinda of flat pasted on wrap around look instead of a 3d space (if that makes sense) The kitchen and how it sets up and looks is awesome but then when you look around its like the enviroment has just been thrown in last minute with how it looks. 2. This one is just a personal request but EVERY game in VR needs coop! :) Even if just arcade mode, 2 people behind the line shouting orders and taking different tasks would be great fun!"
