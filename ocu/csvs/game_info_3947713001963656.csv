The community is a little bit toxic but other than that the game is super fun to play with friends. I also love this game because the accessories and super fun to put on and super cheap. It has a variety of clothes, items, hats to choose from and they all look super good. There are also various fun detailed maps to play with your friends and family. You can play 1s 2s 3s 4s with anybody. If you wanna join a private match just type in a code and tell the people your playing with yo join up. The graphics are also very good. It hardly ever lags and you can have to 90 fps. The quality of the game is very good to I hope you find my review helpful thank you. Big ballers is probally the best vr game out so you don‚Äôt wanna miss out","Big ballers basketball is the most fun basketball game on vr. The devs are nice, cool environments, some nice people, good maps, and fun activities. The shooting is great, you can shoot however you want. It has really good dribbling control and what I like is you can change the power of whenever you shoot. It is way better then gym class, blacktop hoops, and more. Love it, keep adding updates!! üòÅ","Don‚Äôt know what to do with that ten dollars? Well, look no further than Big Ballers VR! The shooting feels very nice and smooth. Gameplay is fun and exciting! There‚Äôs a massive variety of hats and other apparel. You can even customize your character! As exciting as that sounds, rank up to be #1!","I recommend this game to play basketball it is close to the real sport itself but you can with people from different areas online and go against them in 1v1 & 2v2. There are alot of different maps and game modes then just basketball they have football, volleyball & dodgeball and more. Thats my review on big baller‚Äôs basketball","Overall this game is pretty fun. The running mechanics and the overall movement is amazing. I think that when you dribble the basketball it comes right up to your hand and makes the game way more exciting. I also like the cosmetics and the football game mode, with cosmetics they are unique in a way that wants me to get more and more of them. Also with football it does not change the game but it‚Äôs so fun and getting to experience these 2 modes in 1 game is amazing."
