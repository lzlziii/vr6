I'm just glad you got to work on this game so much.",This game was the best with friends and now no one can play together. Don’t give up on it. Has been a year or something since I has heard a child screaming at the sight of the monsters and I want other to experience the fun. Please come back. Please,"Hey, I'm Sir.Toasy. And I had this game for a while. I loved it. I truly did. I'd get home after school and play this game until my battery died with complete strangers. I truly loved it. I even said it was better than G Tag. And if you're still working on that photon update. Don't give up! Literal hundreds or even thousands enjoy this game. As a community, we love your project. So please. If it takes even longer. Hopefully, the end product will be legendary! Thanks for the fun times, laughs, and screams! And hopefully, those will return. Thank you! Really. - Sir.Toasty",Please bring multiplayer back and continue to work on this:( I’ve been waiting 11 months :[,Pls bring it back I have been waiting for 19 months
