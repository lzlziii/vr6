SkydiveSim Demo,"SkydiveSim brings the thrill of skydiving and BASE jumping to your Oculus Quest headset. No more waiting on weather on bad weather days. Put on your headset and choose from our gorgeous levels. Jump from a plane 10,000 feet above ground. Challenge yourself to go through the free fall rings. Then pull your ripcord and fly under the canopy and finally work on your accuracy and land on the target. You don't need a plane ride back up, just repeat in the same scene or choose another one of our exotics environments to jump into. Want even more excitement? Jump from top of the buildings at night and navigate your way between buildings to your choice of landing area!",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Action, Flying, Simulation",English,1.5.8,V Axis Studios,AV1 Productions,http://SkydiveSim.com/,"Jan 20, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4769001379785788/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4769001379785788&r=1, https://www.privacypolicies.com/privacy/view/130ff4c1b0687c52ebc5095cc923e4f6",Terms of Service,1.64 GB,Will kick me out when I attempt to open,"Graphics feel like they were beyond lazy, controls are non existent, the demo only lets you do one single run that doesn’t even show off the potential of the game. Overall disappointing",As a skydiver this is the closest thing to the real thing. Yes it’s work in progress but they constantly update it and it’s getting better and better! Can’t wait for multiplayer!,The canopy piloting part is great. The freefall controls could use some love & I'd like to really reach back to toss/deploy- but overall it's the best game like this on the market. Looking forward to the updates!,Download it tried it 1) we dont all fly the same and so the way it is now movments during free fall is limeted to the 4 axis but no right or left turns 2) add a feature to pull the ripcord when i want not when it shows up 3) canopy flight was nice and acurate simulation to a large degree 4) game crashed when i pressed the oculus button then hit resume 5) graphics are ok should use better models when the $$ start rolling in try linking with orbx they make amazing scenery
