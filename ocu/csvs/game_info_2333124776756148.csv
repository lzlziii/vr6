This method provides enough difference to separate it from the pack. I really enjoyed my time with this game and it’s an easy recommend for rhythm based music game lovers. And even if you’re not into these types of games, it’s definitely worth a “shot”.","I can only play games with song made by mainstream artists. It’s a nice change of pace from Beat Saber. To save $ on this game and others, go to: acaggie,bio,link","Some great songs overall, I even found some new favorite artists like Orion, but the design is terrible. The UI is confusing and ugly. Downloading new songs is a crazy inefficient experience. The worst of it all is the level design. Lower difficulty levels seem disconnected from the song and beat. Higher difficulty levels are hampered by the biggest flaw in the game design: it feels like they wanted to make a dancing game and then slapped shooting on top of it. So you are forced by the design to try and match this invisible dancers movements rather than invoking an instinct response that games like Pistol Whip excel at. Those games inspire you to react to the gameplay and the music in a way that moves your body instinctually. This game wants you to learn a dance routine that you can’t see.","I got Beat Saber for my PlayStation VR back in 2018 and immediately fell in love with the VR rhythm game genre. From there I went on to play games like Audio Tripp, Pistol Whip and Ragnarock, but Audica is the pinnacle of the genre. Every game I listed here can provide the flow-state experienced rhythm gamers know so well, but none are quite like Audica. When describing this game to friends I like to say, ""It's like being a music conductor, on the astral plane."" Easily the best flow-state out of all of them. I think one of the things that has both held this game back from greater success and made it so satisfying to play, is that there's a little bit of a learning curve. Nothing drastic, but not as simple as swinging a saber in the direction the arrows tell you to. For those complaining about lack of new content, please be aware that there is a ton of user created content that's never more than a Google search away. Enjoy.","The latest update fixed the issue with the low resolution. Thank you! I love this game and I own the Quest and the PC version. I prefer the Quest version over the PC version because of the image clarity and the ease of use. This game gets super fun after you learned how to play it. It has a quite steep learning curve which can be discouraging but there is a campaign wich helped me to get better until I could finish it with the hardest difficulty. Besides that there are many songs, even free DLC songs, and a small but dedicated community for customs songs."
