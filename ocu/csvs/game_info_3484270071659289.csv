Being a Star Wars fan for such a long time and wanting a good SW VR game (vader immortal was good but you could barely even move) and this one takes the cake. The movement and graphics are so smooth and clean, with the combat and general story being pretty cool. It DOES take place during when the First Order took control, so its pretty far in the story’s timeline. The game is amazingly well done, but i must say its quite short unless you pay around 10-15$ to expand the story by 2-3x its original length (which in my opinion was VERY worth it). Spoilers(?) I just wish they would’ve expanded on the story of Ady Sun’Zee a little more as her story was quite short being only 1 mission without the dlc and around 2-3 with dlc included. With said DLC, it expands on Ady Sun’Zee’s story by atleast 2 missions (or “stories”), gives you the ability to play as the infamous IG-88, and it expands the main story ALOT. It goes from its original story to expanding it to where you actually fight the First Order in all their dangerous glory(?). Spoiler end This game is a certain buy if you have the money to spare and get the DLC along with it so you dont go through around 8-15 hours of straight gameplay and immediately beat it. I gotta say after playing Vader Immortal and other SWVR games, this one is probably the best one. Im sorry for you Vader Immortal enjoyers, but it was just standing there swinging a saber 90% of the time. This game scratched my itch for a good SW game because it actually had fully fleshed out combat with free movement. I rate it a 9.2/10. Sincerely, Necro","This game is great, though there are some flaws. Pros: - The story is simple, yet full of action. - There are multiple areas where you fight pirates, droids, and even the Empire. The enemies are relatively realistic and can put up a good fight at times. - Mubo’s Workshop is a place to collect inventory.(i.e. droids, customized gloves, holsters, etc). You can gain credits through completing challenges and bringing mini droids and parts. - Seezelslak’s Cantina is a great place to play a game of darts, grab a drink and some food, and hear a story or two. Cons: - The Workshop’s inventory is rather limited in its choices. - The blasters are somewhat inaccurate, so eyeballing your shots is necessary. - If you are planning on buying this game, the extension is a must in order to experience the story in its entirety. - Each story is short and set, so there aren’t any possible deviations (except, of course, game over, in which case you restart). - No multiplayer option. You have to brave the planet of Battu on your own. If Meta Quest is reading this, please add more stories and maybe some other possible story outcomes to the current ones. Updating weaponry to have increased accuracy or including scopes would be helpful. It would be great if players could choose suits and the corresponding tools/weapons associated with them (Mandalorian, Jedi, IG unit, Star Wars Characters, etc.). Multiplayer would also be a great addition, allowing players to work as a units against troopers and pirates. Hope you find this helpful and that you buy the game. It is worth every penny and has been a blast and out of this world (couldn’t help but add a pun or two).","Graphics are nice, playing the game is nice and gives you the feeling you are really there. Took a little time to understand how it's working, and the more you learn the better it's is getting. It's not very hard to play, I also have motion sickness but with using the teleport function it goes well, I can play until the quest2 vr glasses given a warning , battery empty and not feeling very sick at all. Just needs some rest. When battery is full I can play further, mostly waiting a bit longer.","This is one of the best VR games up to date. It’s the best Star Wars Quest game for sure. The Vader ones worked more as a tech demo/on rails game. But this one is a more complete gaming experience, with quests, exploration, collectibles and fun gameplay. If you're doubting on which game to pick, this one is one of the best options out there, even if you’re like me, not a full Star Wars fan."
