You can now join our Discord server and meet other handpan players, take part in giveaways, ask us anything and have a lot of fun together! https://discord.gg/oburgames Thanks to the latest hand tracking technology, Handpan VR allows you to improvise with ethereal sounds coming out of your hands, customize the music with various ambient sounds and beats, and an unlimited number of handpan loops you can record. Whether you are an amateur or a professional handpan player, Handpan VR is a great way to carry this rare, new generation hand hammered steel instrument wherever you are.

Features in the next update (v2.0): - New handpan scales - Beat maker - Adjustable metronome - Sound bank selection for beats and ambients - Save/Load - Record and share songs - Introductory tutorial - Play with controllers - Real environments - Adjustable height",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing","Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Music & Rhythm",English,0.1,Obur Games,Obur Games,https://oburgames.com/,"Jul 14, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/7822966567728803/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=7822966567728803&r=1, https://oburgames.com/privacy/",Terms of Service,487.9 MB,"It's better than I expected and at $4 I think it's fairly priced. However, it gets boring fairly quickly with just a single handpan. It needs multiples or ideally the ability to customize each note on the drum. Do that and I'd recommend it to people at $15. I don't like the idea of selling more handpans as DLC. Give us full customization at a base price.",It is a good application if you do not own a real handpan. Worth the 4 bucks. It is good but the quality of the hand tracking (metas fault) and the fact that you cannot save tracks prevents it from 5 stars.,Really great app look good sounds good and fair price. Please add enviroments to choose and option to learn how to play with it. Great work. Thank you ðŸ˜Š,"Ultimately I think this could be a powerful gem of an app (with a larger market and justified price increase) if the rough edges are smoothed out and an alternative focus (or repivot) on meditative playing and learning. Personally, I'm not interested in mixing etc, though I get that a lot of people are. I think adding quality immersive scenery, with no on screen gizmo distractions, just the instrument would be great. A significant learning enhancement a la Piano Vision style, teaching the user notes by displaying them to be touched would be a great selling point. Tbf I've only had a brief look at it and some of this may already be available, but it seems a unique opportunity to mix meditation and music playing and learning. A great start, cool app.","What I liked * Very good sound * Ability to alter the sounding of each hand (gloves, etc) * Nice environments Points for improvement * Add more instruments (e.g. I have one with 8 tones) and scales * Treat index and thumb fingers differently (now they produce same sounds) * Treat ding, rim differently (now sound is the same) * Hitting in between tones results in nearest tone sound (bug/feature?). Same with trying to play shoulder. * Maybe optimize tracking performance somehow? Not sure but fast hand movements are not always working well."
