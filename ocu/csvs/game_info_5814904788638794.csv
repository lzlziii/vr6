BallisticVR,It's a puzzle game where you start by taking a tutorial to teach you how to use the input system to control the missiles before launch them to hit the targets. The directions that the player inputs is relative to the missile's axis all the time and the player can hit the targets with so many variations of inputs. You need to go throw a magnetic field to hit some of the targets which increases the level of difficulty as you progress in the game. When you finish the level in a the fastest time you can put your name on the board.,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Casual, Puzzle",English,1.7,EYEFORK STUDIOS,EYEFORK STUDIOS,https://www.eyefork.com/,"Apr 27, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5814904788638794/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5814904788638794&r=1, https://www.eyefork.com/privacy-policy",619.9 MB,"The bones of a solid game are here but I think there are some real opportunities for quality of life updates. Stop the orbs from moving. I have my path dialed in, it doesn't make sense for them to move. The dials should also be able to be turned with the controller joystick if your hand is by it. Maybe a speed option. If I'm just changing the last dial, can I speed up the rocket and time proportionally (to keep the integrity of the leaderboards)? All that being said, if you want to think and play a solo game, each level takes a good amount of time and trial and error."
