I played the first level and then had to uninstall the game because I just couldn't. There might be jump scares in later levels, but I didn't even make it that far. I will try again when there are people around me to keep me from having an anxiety attack mid-game. There's a bit of jankiness to the game, but frankly, I kind of like it because it gives it an early 2000's vibe to it like the first Silent Hill games.","So the first time I played this I was too freaked out so I just stayed in the room with the dolls and I learned a VERY good lesson. NEVER STAY IN THE DOLL ROOM. I was jumpscared by the clown doll when I looked away for about a second and looked back at it, it was gone. About 7 seconds later I got jumpscared. Still traumatized from that.","Im playing on oculus and it is amazing but the fact you cant enter the room with a doll on ur head kinda sucks and morty being absolutly cracked made that night kinda contradict the call, but other than that amazing scary game, that was a really cool expeirence (beat night five first try only encounterinh isis)","I’m relatively new to VR horror. However I’ve installed a few from App Lab to experience more. This game. Let me just say. Really knows how to make your spine crawl. Night two and I already freaked out enough to put the headset down to take a breather and just write this review. “Hey, it’s just me. Don’t worry. Where are you?” -Moments before disaster.","I found this game out from my brothers oculus. I was curious about what it was so I downloaded it. The first time I played it, I got pretty freaked out by the dolls. When I actually did the gameplay I was freaked out. It was so scary the way the doll crawls towards you. I kinda hate that you cant do anything against the doll, you just have to accept your death."
