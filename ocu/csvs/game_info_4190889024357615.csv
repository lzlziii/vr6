Honeybee VR,"We start on a flower meadow. Look around and take some time - there is a lot to discover! Watch out for the big white circles. They take you to another scene. The small white circles start a scenario. If you look down, you can start the menu. Here you can activate an info mode, which gives you more information during the exploration tour.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","360 Experience (non-game), Educational, Exploration","German, German (Switzerland)",1.2,STEP-ANI-MOTION GmbH,Südwestrundfunk Baden-Baden Planet Schule,http://honigbiene-vr.de/,"Aug 1, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4190889024357615/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4190889024357615&r=1, https://www.planet-schule.de/service/datenschutz-182.html",644.1 MB,"The app is a 3D 360 animation of a bee hive. It's really rather wonderful to watch and admire. As per the app details, German is the only supported language, but you just look at points to trigger animations and move onto the next section. Only a short experience, but wonderful. I'll show this to friends and family.",This is a nice VR Bee environment but is in German with no English option…very well done though..a bit like Ocean Rift in a Bee Hive…
