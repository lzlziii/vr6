The only question that remains for me is: How can you reach 270 stars per chapter? I count 30 levels per chapter, which would be 90 stars per chapter.",Love this game. Very similar to zuma and zuma’s revenge which I loved playing on pc so if like me you loved these games you’ll love this,"I really like the game, I do. But every time I Exit the game my headset glitches and my Menu will not pop up. Actually, nothing will pop up regardless of what I click. I have to restart my headset every time. This is the only app that causes this issue.",Great game. I play this at night when I want to wind down. I’ve always loved playing zuma and this is it in VR.,How this is game not on the main Oculus Store is beyond me. This is already a AAA puzzle game that is addictive as they come.
