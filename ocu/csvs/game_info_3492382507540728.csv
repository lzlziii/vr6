Admiral Wars,"How to play video: https://youtu.be/m6IE9wMSlYE Admiral Wars breathes new life into the strategy game genre thanks to the capabilities of VR by putting you in the middle of the action. It’s not enough to out-maneuver or out-gun opponents, you must also protect the flagship at all costs. One lapse of concentration is all it takes for an opponent’s guns to line up right outside the starboard window, and if that happens, well… as they say, a good captain always goes down with the ship. Admiral Wars is a VR game for players looking for a brand-new tactical experience that is easy to pick up but difficult to master. Anyone can learn to sail the waves, but it takes an experienced Admiral to conquer them. The game includes a VS AI mode, and a 1v1 multiplayer mode, with much more to be added in the future!

Looked like it would be cool but too frustrated trying to figure it out.,"There is potential here. Obviously a work in progress. The concept is great though. Developers… While you are tinkering, add an option for people who do not have play space or prefer sitting. While sitting all the controls are out of reach, even after re-centering.",Great concept and looking forward to updates as this is still alpha. I did play and win the tutorial. UI is good inovation but needs work and refinment. Seems to be inconsistant and lags or hangs at time. I also assume when the clock reaches 0 the game is over but no explanation or end of game summary. Also please make selected vessel more noticable and highlighted and better destinction of the enemy. Just some thoughts for improvement areas. 3 stars for now but wish for improvements and better playability for better score.,"I've redone the tutorial for this game a few times and I just don't understand it. In the tutorial, you're supposed to move your PT boat to find an enemy aircraft carrier. How does one select their PT boat? Is it the menu to the left? Is it on the map? Is it the buttons below the map? And when you do find the PT boat, you can only move it as far as the edges of the visible map. There's no way to scroll the map. Should your PT boat encounter the enemy aircraft carrier it will be destroyed because the tutorial doesn't explain the other movement options and discourages you from changing them because it will supposedly prevent the PT boat from defending itself. So in summary, I think there are two things very wrong with this game: 1. Buggy map controls, and 2. Incomplete tutorial. As a technical writer with plenty of experience writing tutorials and instructions, the very first thing this game needs is an introduction to the player interface. Don't expect the player to user an interface that they're not familiar with. This game should have gone through blind play testing before release and that very clearly didn't occur.",I'm one of the devs and super excited for everyone to check out the game!
