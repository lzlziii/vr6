It did catch me a little to understand how the game works, but as soon as I started fighting the 1st guy, I started to understand the game a little bit more. I did find that it was a big jump from the 1st guy to the 2nd opponent. I tried going into training mode to see if would show me how to block the opponent's hits because it never taught it So I ended up looking it up on YouTube and as soon as I saw What to do on all the fights I suddenly caught on And started winning",I love this game it is a very good workout. Fun to play love it!,"For those bemoaning that the boxing mechanics are not like what you‚Äôd actually train in a gym, an octopus is one of your opponents. You are almost quite literally fighting in Bugs Bunny land. This is a fun game and you will get a workout in. What I like best is that it‚Äôs not something to take serious like your more realistic boxing vr games. This is a great workout for those who could use a little help in the cardio department.",This game is like Nintendo‚Äôs Super Punch Out in VR. It‚Äôs more arcade style fun and less boxing sim.
