Green Hell VR,"Follow the story of Jake Higgins, a famous anthropologist, who is thrown deep into the emerald and impenetrable Amazonian rain forest - the green hell. What you discover will be worse than what you fought so hard against to survive. Find yourself stranded in a dangerous jungle, surrounded by predators with only a trusty smartwatch, backpack, and the survival guide, so craft away! VR makes crafting even more realistic as you need to find the right elements and put them together in a specific way to make tools, spears, and shelter - all by hand! Watch your vitals and discover herbs with their medical potential to stay healthy. Hunt wild animals to secure the next meal and defend yourself with a bow and arrow - work on your aim and level up your skill. With mechanics adjusted to virtual reality, Green Hell VR: Quest Edition is a truly immersive and demanding game - Find out how long you can stay alive.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Simulation","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), Czech, French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), Spanish (Spain)",1.3.4,Incuvo S.A.,Incuvo S.A.,https://greenhellvr.com/,"Apr 7, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3815577785147028/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3815577785147028&r=1, https://incuvo.com/en/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,3.05 GB,"Sorry if my grammar is bad I really liked this game the graphics are really good and is probably the best survival game on vr. This game is completely worth the money and would recommend this to anyone. I haven’t seen a single bug every and my experience was amazing. This game is pretty hard bet fun. The only thing that I want to come to this game is multiplayer. I could just imagine me and my friend hunting a tiger together of playing the story mode together, and laughing at my friend because he has 15 parasites and has food poisoning. It would just be so much funnier to play and would probably make people want to buy the game. I get that putting multiplayer in a game can be really hard to do but it would make the game so much better. I’m still giving this 5 stars because of the experience I had with this. Have a good day","I think that green hell be should involve the quest 2 players a bit more like in pc vr they can get mud stuff from going to a river. But for the quest players it is very difficult or impossible to do because I have never seen me be able to get mud in green hell VR on the quest. Now I am not trying to bellyache because I’m bad at the game but I think there should be a new tutorial like basic crafting, intermediate crafting and advanced crafting would help the new players and the noobs get on there feet and play the game to have fun. Over all green hell VR on the quest is a fun game and I totally recommend trying it for those who are thinking about buying it","So, this game. IT IS INCREDIBLE. BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED AND IF YOU ARE THINKING OF GETTING THIS, GET IT!!! 5 STARSSSS!!!! WORTH THE PRICE IS WORTH IT AND THE GRAPHICS ARE THE BEST I HAVE SEEN. ⚠️WARNING⚠️ There is quite a lot of swear words. Overall I give this game a 100/10 best game I have ever played. DEFINITELY BUY THIS ONE!!!!","The game how it is right now feels pretty good for a survival game. Although, there are some additions I'd like to be added in Green Hell to impvore the game. 1. Map Expansion The world of green hell feels a bit too small. Maybe adding some more landmarks of sorts will make this game more Adventurous. 2. Destroy Item Button When you start stacking alot of items in one area it starts lagging really badly. Adding a destroy mechanic will increase overall FPS and not dealing with lag. 3. Improved Combat SFX For example, if I were to stab a Tribal Warrior with a spear, I don't hear any blood splatter sounds, instead it's just very unrealistic sounds and doesn't feel good for the fighting environment. Improving the SFX system to combat could definitely make the game feel more realistic. 4: Improved Combat System Alot of times when I'm using a spear to defend against a jaguar, the spear just gets stuck in the jaguars body and it gets very annoying especially when it runs away with your spear. Improving the combat system just a little bit could make spears a more viable option. 5: Improved Crafting System Being able to craft a spear with just your hands feels very comfortable but there are many more things we can craft if we had some sort of crafting table to craft armor, weapons, and other cooler, crazy items. 6: Leg Inspection This game doesn't feel like Green Hell without all your limbs. Adding legs makes the game feel more realistic and Overall better 7: Improved Enemy SFX Often times jaguars/pumas don't make any sort of noises when near, which can be sort of scary when you do t expect it. Adding specific sound effects to other different hostile enemies improves the fighting system the game offers. 8: Multiplayer I'm pretty sure alot of us are waiting for multiplayer to come out, I'm one of them. Adding multiplayer to Green Hell would change the Gameplay Experience by a longshot when it comes to surviving with friends or strangers. 9: Rework to KOTJ Difficulty King of The Jungle Difficulty feels a bit too easy in my opinion. Improving some mechanics of this difficulty such as more Predatory Attacks, or other such things. 10: More Achievements Not too long ago, I just recently unlocked all 29 achievements and it certainly didn't take that long to obtain all of them. I think adding more achievements would make the game more grindy and more rewarding. Overall, I think green hell is a great game, but I can definitely see some improvements to this game, it just feels a bit too small especially once you learn your away around this game. I know the Quest 2 doesn't meet the proper specs when it comes to adding more updates to Green Hell, I honestly don't expect all of these to be added but I'd like for at least a few to be added sometime soon.",I love this game so much but I feel as if all the requests for multiplayer are ignored. It would really improve the game and it would be a lot more enjoyable. And animal husbandry could be added with more pets like parakeets snakes in baskets and maybe even pumas PLEASE ADD MULTIPLAYER sorry I understand how much work it takes
