Barbaria,"Do you have what it takes to be the Mightiest in Barbaria? Welcome to a brutal world where visceral motion-controlled combat blends seamlessly with god-scale base-building and asynchronous multiplayer raids. Use fists, axes, swords, bows, rocks, or anything you can grab to dominate your foes in intense 1st-person combat. Then jump out to your immortal form and watch your minions carry on the battle while you rain down meteors from above. Systemic combat, versatile enemy AI, and player-created defenses make every battle unique. But remember, you aren‚Äôt the only Semigod in Barbaria! Attack other players‚Äô realms to increase your Mightiness, and receive rewards when you successfully repel others. Watch replays in miniature from your Stronghold, then strategically place and upgrade more structures, champions, and minions to keep future attackers at bay. Features: ‚óè Kill it your way: 1st-person combat with a variety of weapons and minions who can serve as both allies and enemies ‚óè Asynchronous Multiplayer: Attack player-created realms, and get attack notifications each time you launch the game ‚óè Realm Building: Snap together realm Fragments and strategically set up your defenses ‚óè Raid Replay: Watch tabletop replays of attacks on your realm by other players ‚óè Death from Above: Hop out to god-scale and use Ancient Powers to direct the battle from on high",16+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Fighting, Strategy",English,1.2.2.20134.83.OBERON.Quest.release,"Stalwart Games, LLC","Stalwart Games, LLC",https://barbariavr.com/,"Feb 9, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5296016923775393/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5296016923775393&r=1, https://www.stalwart.com/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,2.17 GB,"Where do i even get started, this game is amazing it has tons of content and is extremely fun and addicting, they are continuously updating this game and it can only get better. I have so many game and this is instantly in my top 3 and i play it often now Search Multiver.Bio.Link so you can get 25 off of this game and many more, Hit ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù if this made your purchase even more worth it.","This appeals to me as I've read the other reviews,saying it's like Clash Of Clans but in Vr,as I've been playing Clash for about 9 years or more, haven't got Gorn to compare,like others mentioned. So far no glitches,apart from getting the axe out and it appears the wrong way round,lol, but not always. An enjoyable and fun game with decent graphics for this type of game and it's fairly brutal but so much fun,grabbing your enemies and throwing them over the edge,lol or when they throw a rock at you,you can grab it mid air and throw it back,so funny. Received my Axe, Shield,Bow and arrows and you also get a very large hammer,like being Thorüí™ & a sword. Definitely has that Clash of Clans feel about it but this is unique in its own way. I'm enjoying it and will carry on playing,once my controllers charge up. In the meantime, here is 25percent off to help you decide... Just add the beginning part. /Greekspartan121/5296016923775393/?utm_source=2 Enjoy and many thanks.... Update.. I didn't know that the quest controllers can suffer from Drifting issues. Thumbstick has now been replaced and no more drifting,I'm glad to report,easy fix.Funny it all started with this game,1st time I noticed it but it happens on other games also.Not anymore..",Ever sense it came out I had it it seemed small at first it's been months I had it and it hasn't stop updating getting better and better and with new update its way better now. 100000\10 BEST FIGHTING GAME if you like carnage blood and bring a semi God then I 300% recommend it BARBARIA SEASE RHE DAYüíôüëç,"This game is criminally underrated, and that's saying something considering it still has a top rated badge! I love checking in every day to see whose attacked my kingdom, and return the favor by attacking back. They've also started rolling out GREAT updates. If you've been on the fence, GET IT NOW!!",I love progression and I love building my realm layout and finding out new things myself in it worth every penny only reason I get on my quest daily at all I hope it can help the game get support and recognition and if you are considering getting it it is so fun it is like clash of clans but the boring parts are removed and you are able to fight and be in the battle and get to play as multiple characters I hope this game succeeds and thrives
