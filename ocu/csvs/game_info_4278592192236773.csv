This game knocks the pants off the competition with the realistic throwing physics. I found myself spending way too long at the driving range throwing drives. I play disc golf all the time and throwing a full power drive is surprisingly satisfying. My main complaint is the putting and forehand. There's some artificial vertical velocity added to your putts that make them go extremely far. I still have been unable to throw a successful forehand shot, it seems to go in a random direction each time. With some tuning for the putts and forehands this game could be amazing!"
