What the problem is, is the seating. The seating is at Shoulder Neck level instead of below the waistline to represent sitting on a seat. Right now, the seating is so high, that it covers part of the screen as so that you cannot watch anything at all because the seats in front are blocking your view... something has gone wrong with the programming in someway. The app is in its current state, unusable... the seating needs to be correctly lowered down to the correct height, as of right now the seat am supposed to be sitting on is directly right underneath my chin at neck height. Also am still very disappointed after so many years now, that your app still does not support LAN,,, so that I can stream my movie files directly from my PC computer... why ?. Even BIGSCREENVR has now added the option of watching DISNEY PLUS app and YouTube etc... why not CINEVR ???. ONE STAR because I cannot even use the app right now, its useless to me when its not even working correctly... can't exactly watch a film with my seat at shoulder neck height now, can i ?",WTF!?,The game is not woker,Needs a lot of work. Basically a worthless app,If i could i would give you 0 stars. Literally you can do nothing with this app. Files wont play from internal memory and smb shares never show up. To make things worse support dont reply to emails. Save yourself the time and dont bother even trying
