All the quirky humor and cool aesthetic is there with new and challenging puzzles. If you liked the previous ones this is a no brainier! For those who haven’t tried before this is an escape room type game with a secret agent flair and a lot of humor and great spy tropes. Give it a shot to be sure!,"I've played and 100% the first two I Expect You To Die games and I have to say this one DEFINITELY lives up to the first two I Expect You To Die games. (If not probably even better!) I have so much to say about this game so I'll write it here in this review. ⚠️Spoilers beyond this point ⚠️ - Opening Song 🎵 Now the first two I Expect You To Die games had an absolute banger opening song and I was a bit worried if they were gonna be able to pull it off again for the third time. To my surprise they not only managed to make another banger, but this one may even be BETTER than The Spy and The Liar! (Sorry Juniper) The next I Expect You To Die game is 100% gonna have another amazing intro. Schell Games never disappoint! (Please add Cog In The Machine to Spotify 🙏) - Gameplay 🎮 This game's gameplay is great but very challenging. I was stuck on some levels for almost 30 minutes! (*cough* Hot Water *cough*) But apart from that, it has very fun puzzles and makes you think inside and outside the box! Getting through the challenges is also very rewarding, (especially the level-themed food item!) From fighting robots to a giant squid, this game's gameplay is not only extremely fun but also challenging at most. - Story/Lore 📖 I'm not usually the type of guy to get into the lore of a game, but the I Expect You To Die Lore has definitely got me intrigued. I won't go fully in-depth with the story but the main idea is: Dr. Prism is a former inventor for the Agency and she created telekinesis implants in every single agent's brain. After many cases of agents dying, Prism decided to create robot agents to replace the human agents. Since robot agents = more intelligent and not so fragile. But Dr. Morales (Director of the Agency) refused her plans to replace human agents. After her rejection, Dr. Prism decides to work with Zor and show the world how superior her robots are to frail, emotional human agents. That's all I have to say about this game and I'm really excited for whatever Schell Games will do in the future! (Also Dr. Prism is mommy, fight me)",I’ve played the first two games over and over to completion and I’m so happy they added a third one. This game has awesome puzzles that may take a while but it’s so satisfying to finish. This game is 100/10 and definitely is one of the best vr games i’ve ever played. Keep the series going shell games as I’m definitely looking forward to the next one!!
