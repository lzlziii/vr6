This app used to use the Meta avatars. In the last update they got rid of that and changed the avatars to built-in ones that look very weird. The hands and wrists especially look awfulâ€¦ like a rubber chicken getting twisted. Iâ€™m tired of having to create new avatars for games. The Meta ones are good enough and look much less awkward than these new ones. Iâ€™m also not a fan of the arcade-style games they added into the practice pool hall, which have very mediocre physics. It makes what used to feel like a very polished and professional game feel cheaper and cheesier. Critiques aside, this is still the best pool game on Quest by far, with great physics and great visuals. I just donâ€™t want to see it going the wrong direction. Please donâ€™t try to be like that ForeVR junkâ€¦",So it definitely feels more real then other pool games and graphics are better but I don't know what happened they used to have the hoops and punching bag game in there for others to play on while waiting on a table or in general but just went in and they have been removed ughhh... won't give it 5 star till back devs,I used to play this game quite regularly. I came to play a game of pool (after some time) and was initially disappointed with the new version. After I initially gave the game a one star review â€“ I really thought more on it - and I thought that I should really take a good look at the new game - to be very fair. After doing so I realize the game is not as bad as I initially reviewed it. In fact I did enjoy playing it with the new changes. I wish to apologize to the developers for my initial one star review and Iâ€™m changing it to four stars. I know that you are most likely aspiring to make it a five star game. My apologies on my initial review and reaction.ï¿¼
