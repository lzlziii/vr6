Can't click out of the main menu, I guess I'm gonna have to get a refund, it was a cool idea too :/","For one I want to say. I love the ideas you have for the worlds you create. Lots to do for sure. However; with that said. Not being able to turn that annoying music off sucks. I’d rather hear the game in silence( no music), or at the very least have a option. On another note I found it incredibly glitchy, and movement was not great at all. For now I’ll be refunding it, but I’m going to keep my eye on updates for it. Also would like to see more of the survival aspects.",I was trying to find a Minecraft vr alternative to play before it became native to the quest,"This first version shows much promise. Unfortunately, the controls are very glitchy and need a fair amount of tweaking. It needs more options for turning, i.e. right stick. Having to hold left grip for turning is terrible. Movement also has its issues, I keep getting stuck on the floor, unable to move around correctly. Some general options (i.e. mute the music) would be appreciated also. Hopefully, these issues can easily be fixed.","The options here are quite impressive and I like the Passthrough options. I know it's early days yet but this has potential. Unless I missed the option, I'd like to see animals/people populating created worlds. My son just played and thoroughly enjoyed it. Looking forward to updates."
