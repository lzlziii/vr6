I love the fast paced action and how every level offers you different enemies, obstacles, etc... I was a huge Road Rash fan growing up and while this game differs in certain aspects, I still am amazed how realistic it feels while riding on a lighting fast motorcycle trying to take out your foes. The music askso adds to the intensity and fun factor as well. Well done guys and I hope that there is a sequel!!!","Between the high speeds, the intense synth wave music, and the brrrrrrrt from the machine guns, your brain is just gonna shed dopamine all over the place. It really does feel exhilarating in a way no other game has ever made me feel. This is an essential game to have in your library if youre interested in having games on your headset to impress friends with an unforgettable experience who want to try VR for first time. I consider myself kind of middle of the road when it comes to susceptibility to motion sickness in VR. I didnt have to make any settings adjustments on this game and after playing all 7 levels multiple times I haven’t experienced any nausea. Even with a current rating of 4.7 which is really high for a Quest game, it’s still highly underrated. Im shocked nobody ever told me about this game.","I’m not the biggest anime fan, and I don’t find the graphics impressive… But! When this game gets up to speed, with engines singing, sirens screaming, and guns blazing it’s VR magic. This is the game that I play when I don’t know what else to play. For retro folks: it’s like Contra, ExciteBike, and Ninja Gaiden had a big beautiful VR baby.",This game really surprised me since I didn’t know what to expect. It’s the type of game I can honestly say I’ve NEVER played before. Kind of like a serious Mario kart? Prolly not the best way to describe it but it’s a racing game with combat included. Pretty dang addictive,"This games gameplay is unreal, it is fast paced and so satisfying. The bosses are fantastic, the soundtrack is fantastic, the visuals are fantastic, enemy variety is fantastic. It is just an absolute masterpiece that needs more recognition. The game is hard, but not stupidly hard. It hits the sweet spot of not being too easy but also not making you want to chuck your headset at the wall. I have already done one playthrough and will most likely do a few more, if you are on the fence about buying it just know it is absolutely worth every penny."
