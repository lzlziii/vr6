Unfortunately the videos in this app are far too low quality to come even close to the same feeling. It just doesn't work like the real place at all. Also the videos are 2D 360 degree but the main menu is in actual 3D, the quality is that inconsistent.",When you need something extra fast then transport yourself to Iceland To meditate with Flow is both motion and movement Could highly recommend this,Love the magnificient scenery and soothing messages!,I thought it would be some kind of 3D vr videos but everything is flat. At least the free ones. Only the main menu is in 3d. YouTube is full of 360 videos much better than these. I put one star otherwise i cannot submit,For me this helps on daily basis. Have a short relaxing moment in between busy days at work. Helps to tune the brain when changing from one teams meeting to another. Only thing is to remember to book 1-2 slots per day in calendar to do this!
