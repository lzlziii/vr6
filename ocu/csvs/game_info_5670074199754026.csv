Go from planet to planet as you fight against futuristic robots and drones in this arcade shooter.

Compete against your friends for the best score in the survival game mode to get your name on the leaderboard. This game includes 6 unique levels, an infinite survival mode, and multiple secrets hidden throughout the levels.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Shooter",English,1.0.1,WonderSense Games,WonderSense Games,https://www.wondersensegames.com/,"Apr 19, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5670074199754026/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5670074199754026&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X22wcjKD6tT9sjzxa3leN8VH3gJMsGai97ceO_vfffg/edit",854.8 MB,"This game is pretty good in all aspects with great potentials, except for one major flaw: Each enemy/target takes multiple hits to kill/destroy, but there is no auto function (or if it is there I can't find it), meaning you'd have to pull the trigger for every shot. It may not sound too bad, but it requires pulling the trigger hundreds of times just to get through one level, which is EXTREMELY tiring. I hope the developer could either make the enemies easier to kill with 1-2 shots, or add an auto function, otherwsie it is just not playable and I'd have to get a refund. I'll wait till it is closer to the end of the 14-day trial period."
