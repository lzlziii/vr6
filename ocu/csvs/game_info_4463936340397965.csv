Exit Condition One,"You awake from cryo in a mysterious museum. A robot refers to you as a curator and the security system is malfunctioning. Can you get things back to normal and escape? You'll need to solve puzzles that include drone navigation, crafting, routing power, rewiring circuits, climbing, physically navigating mazes, and dancing. Some puzzles will have you moving in and out of AR and VR within the game itself. There are four main rooms and the final room is a ""boss level"" that contains the largest variety of puzzles. There are no jump scares. The game is designed ground-up for roomscale VR on the Quest, but supports all locomotion modes. Most objects can be interacted with, it fully uses physics, and the hands don't ""ghost out."" Note: This game is currently in early access. It is fully playable and fun, with around 2 hours of play time. A target of 3-4 hours of playtime and a price of $14.99 is planned for the finished game. https://discord.gg/2NfBumhKQD",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Puzzle",English,.999.10,Damon Poole,Damon Poole,https://exitconditions.com/,"Dec 6, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4463936340397965/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4463936340397965&r=1, https://exitconditions.com/privacy-policy/",945.1 MB,"This is a great example of how small businesses can disrupt the VR industry. I'm not an expert in VR, but wow... it is clear a lot of work and thought went into this. If you like escape rooms and/or puzzles, this is definitely worth trying. I am really impressed by the visuals. I've only done a couple escape rooms, so some of this takes a bit more time for me to figure out... but there are plenty of hints if you need them. It all fits into a well thought out plot, and really takes advantage of VR (there are things that would be nearly impossible to replicate in a real escape room). And the developer clearly takes pride in the work here. This is a perfect example of a title in the App Lab that should really be available in the main store.",The only thing I wish is that there was more Thanks devs for the game :),"Thanks so much for continuing to improve this game. ðŸ¤ž there will be much more to come! Will definitely buy what you build! UPDATE Played the Office space and really enjoyed it! Can't wait to have time to play the next level. It looks awesome! Your creativity is to be applauded. (Don't want to spoil anything by being specific) Thank you for building this and please please please, keep building. I will buy and enjoy every escape room style game you build! Intrigued by the atmosphere, puzzles and challenges. Absolutely adore escape room style games and hope to encourage the development of many more! Thanks, devs! *Manufacturing Will try other spaces soon Thank you!","Is a very good scape room game but the climb mechanics needs to be upgraded, it happens only in one level so i gonna give it 5 stars. Oh and yes i played the demo and i was waiting to play this game. Update: very good game, now the climbeng feels more natural and isn't laggy","Escape room games are right up my alley. I'm only on the ""office"" and already this game has exceeded my expectations. Had to take a break because my little pug, Abby Rose, hears the call of mother nature. As soon as she is finished I'm gonna get right back to it. I am having a blast with this early access and I already know that I'll be getting the finished version as soon as it's released. I've only hit a couple of very minor glitches. But the glitches in no wsy hindered my total enjoyment of what the devs have created. Well done! Thanks for your response! The only problem I encountered was, to me, very minor. There were times when my hands would get stuck in drawers and chairs. Again, this did not diminish my enjoyment of the gameplay. I am eagerly waiting for the final release."
