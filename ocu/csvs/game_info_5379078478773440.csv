I'm a sucker for detective games and incorporating FMV, so this really scratched an itch. The acting wasn't oscar-worthy, but nuanced enough to give you subtle clues about people's motives. The gameplay was pretty solid and enjoyable for about $10. My only complaint is there's not enough of it! There needs to be more cases and more suspects. It's a pretty straightforward game. I think my first playthrough took a little over an hour and it says I can play again and make different choices to affect the outcome! I'd love a game built on this engine with bonus cases as DLC, some with 4-5 suspects, and some with video testimony from medical examiners or forensic experts creating a Rashomon-like narrative."
