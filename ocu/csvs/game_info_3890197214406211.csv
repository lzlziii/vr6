I like the game but it's very hard to play with quest controllers. Developers previously promised that they will support to regular gamepads connected to quest but they never did.,"Because of the StarTrack boss is really really hard to beat. I tried a hundred time and did scratch his paint a few times but that is it. SO i am pretty pissed. Had it on the Oculus Go, then on the Quest 2. Great game EXCEPT the last Boss","I kept going back and forth on this one. Glad I bought it. Easy to pick up and play a quick game. Controls are straightforward. Visuals and animations are nice, and the overhead view works well. Plus there’s a ton of content to unlock. It’s definitely a hidden gem.","I had already bought this game for the Oculus Go a few years ago... I had to buy it again (dreaming of crossplay....). Apart from this (which is serious...) I was hoping they had updated the control system which I had found little intuitive on oculus go.. In fact it would be enough to use a ""classic"" driving system... (such as Mini Motor Racing) but Blaze Rush is not like that... I don't understand why I can't configure the keys in the options... It would take little to improve it....",Just one thing i wonder if there is a way to disable the boosting of your character when you get behind and just let the players race and catch up on there own I guess I didn't explain this correctly what I meant is the player when they get so far behind is leaped forward so as to not allow the leader to much of an advantage is there a way to disable this. Love the game by the way.
