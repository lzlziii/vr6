The whole premise of the game is that you have two hammers and are protecting your cake from waves of mice and a boss at the end of each wave. To spice it up a bit a few mice have random items that will either hurt you or help you. For example some nice have coins (to upgrade your hammer) and others have a heart which seems to slow down time temporarily. Others will have bombs which you do not want to hit or throw ink in your face, temporarily obstructing your view. Visually the game really surprised me as well. It isn't the best looking game ever but is very clean and has a nice art style. I would have liked to see more kitchen environments but the game is very tiny filesize wise. You can grind for coins to upgrade your hammers and chase the leaderboards which keeps you coming back. This is actually a great game for VR novices or children. As an adult, I obviously enjoyed it but I think the price is too high for what is here. It's a fun minigame that I think would be more appropriately priced around 4.99 or less. I recommend that the developer either lowers the asking price or adds more modes, similar to modes in Fruit Ninja. Still you could spend 8.00 on far less fun things to do. I still recommend the game if you like chasing leaderboards, have children, or are a kid at heart.","My mother have been playing for a couple hours and she really like it. It may seem simple, but it's actually quite fun. If you like Whack-a-mole games, I highly recommend it.","Easy, simple, but fun game. In addition, it can exercise. Immersion is the best...",The game is very fun and challenging at the same time. There are unlockables and the overall idea is great for short playthroughs.,this game's rule is very simple. but as old saying simple is best. this game has full of joyfullness
