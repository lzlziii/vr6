Games is still not loading. You stated itâ€™s been reset, but itâ€™s not resolved. Still stuck on loading, but never loads. Today is 7/13/2023 Still not working, doesnâ€™t load. Iâ€™m unable to give an updated review for an app Iâ€™ve purchased that doesnâ€™t work or load. Unable to play. 7/5/2023 Received message. Still not working. 6/26/23 I would like a refund. This game does not play. Itâ€™s not loading and I paid for this game. Stuck on loading, but it never loads. I like the game, but Iâ€™m unable to play, because of this error. Itâ€™s been like this for 6 days now. If youâ€™re unable to fix, I would like a refund. Please fix. Thank you.","Stuff is so expensive nowadays and I am very upset to say I bought this app for it to work for a week or so, then get stuck on the loading screen. Did as many updates as there were, tried to shut it off and turn it back on, nothing. Had to end up resetting my whole VR , just for it to work for a night. I want a refund because why should I pay for something that isnâ€™t going to work?","Tennis League VR offers many game modes, perfect for all kinds of players! The graphic style is very neat, better than all its competitors. The arcade component makes it a unique game, especially with the inclusion of a minigame (which I definitely recommend trying). I recommend the purchase of this game!","I tried the other popular tennis game but found it too unrealistic/automated (I intentionally served terribly but they corrected all my bad form!). Tennis League is way more fun, has great practice modes, & letâ€™s you fail when you suck so you can actually get better. My serve is improving, & just today I discovered Simulation mode which is less polished - my ball toss needs work! (stick to Arcade mode for a perfect toss each time). The only feature Iâ€™d request is to be able to see SERVE SPEED - I had a few fast ones today & was really curious about itâ€¦ All in all itâ€™s a great tennis game, I play every time Iâ€™m in VR!",Please add an automatic teleportation option. Ball physics are not realistic. Button before initiate ball should be an option not a duty. It could be the top tennis game in the future. In the momentary Version I feel not the a relaxed game flow.
