When it comes to other people(aka children) I miss them running down my lane mid frame as messing with my game playing. Only thing I could ask for is somethings like mutable options for other avatars and maybe a barrier between lanes so balls don't mysteriously fly from the side hitting my ball into the gutter. I'm an old guy (47) and am new to VR so I struggle with movement mechanics enuf without the help from others. So I'm giving it a solid 3-3 1/2 stars,It's a Fun Arcade game with lots of different options and it's FREE! What more can you want from a free game?,I’m confused on how to join a server none of my codes work and the only working server is not working
