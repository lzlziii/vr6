You have different sized pieces and you need to choose the right combination. It makes more sense if you see the gameplay but its a lot of fun and relaxing and has great options to move the table and change its size to make it all the easier to enjoy.,"Good game, great game! The handtracking was smooth though u prefer using the controllers it works well seated and all the puzzles get prggressivly harder as you go but i promise its worth it! Though there are a few bugs like no saving or when you hold a cube it keeps its size even if you shrink the table If you continue this you can either make the cube disapear and break the level or make the cube soo big you cant move it","It's a simple but good puzzle game. We need more games like this. I played the 1.0 version and this game still needs to be improved. First of all, I don't know how to adjust the height of the table. And I want to be able to choose the level. If the game improves, I will review it again.","If you’ve played or are familiar with Cubism, this is a 2D approach to those kind of puzzles. The ability to increase the size of the board was very helpful. I wasn’t able to get the control pad working, perhaps that is still in development? Also, it would be really cool if the puzzle pieces landed on the table top with a solid thud, instead of slipping through the surface, but I imagine that will be addressed as well. Still enjoyable gameplay!",I Don't really like how the pieces fall to the table but then you pick them up and they just hang in the air. it feels like they should fall back to the table.
