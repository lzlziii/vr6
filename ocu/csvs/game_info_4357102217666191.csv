I can see growing and releasing 4 room packs every so often, I'm sure people will pay for addons.","and the puzzle are funny, not the usual -think hard- games. You should think -I'm just playing- and you solve everything. I want more!","A really great game that proved really challenging! I've only played one level at the time of writing this review, but it actually beat me! The only thing I would suggest is possibly adding hints, but I loved the challenge, some great and unique puzzles! My video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HI3EhL8phY",Grate game,Had a blast in these escape rooms. Very creative and clever. Challenging but not excessive. Looking forward to more. Thanks for the fun. Still laughing after I figured out two of the solutions. Great job!
