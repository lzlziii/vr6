I just had the best two hours I have had inquest since red matter 2. , And I’m only a little ways through the game. If you’re not already used to PCVR level graphics you will be blown away by this game just like I was. People who look down their noses at it because it is not As graphically amazing as of 4090 or whatever… Those people are just living in their own echo chamber listening to their own voice. I haven’t seen anything remotely this cool since red matter 2. Don’t fall for the Clickbait! Try it yourself and unsubscribe from that Arrogant hater If he doesn’t change that horrible thumbnail! “ worst port this year” -Absolutely false obviously has an ax to grind about something. The game is great fun for a quest user and I’m really glad that they brought it to quest. I’m nobody I don’t have a big viewership I don’t even have a channel but I know nonsense when I see it. SMH","This game is absolutely stunning on the Quest 2. One of the best Sci-Fi adventure games in all of VR. This game has a great mix of stunning visuals, cool story, great level design, challenging gunplay, and awesome adventure. This amazing game that's been out on PCVR for awhile finally makes its way to Quest, and it's an absolute marvel that they were able to get this game in there. This is what VR is all about, a must buy.","This is the experience I’ve been waiting on for quite a while! Absolutely amazing graphics and gameplay, you can swim, climb, shoot, upgrade etc. It’s an excellent and interesting story based Sci-Fi experience on another planet with well done and balanced variety of game mechanics. Bravo authors! Excellent work!👍 Update: I’ve completed the game yesterday and it’s great all the way through. The only ask to authors now, please continue adding more and more chapters or expansions🔥.","All small parts are there - outstanding graphics, great mechanics, upgraded weapons, long campaign, climbing, swimming, jumping ( with slightly lower gravity ). There is also crossbuy so buying Quest version we receive also PCVR. Wish the team makes the sequel or add story DLC. Still can't believe it is running on a mobile chip. Next to Red Matter 2 best graphics on Quest 2.","I have played this on PCVR, PSVR2 and Quest and I have to say the devs have given us an incredible version of the game. Search YouTube for Paradise Decay Hubris and my impressions of the game on all platforms. I even have a comparison video which will surprise you."
