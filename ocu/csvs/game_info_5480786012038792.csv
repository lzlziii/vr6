One thing I feel might be useful is if you twist the controller angle as so ur holding a handle bar to give a more accurate feel I know this is a bit of a brain smacking thing to do ( the program ing side of development is the hardest bit lol ) but great work and I look forward to seeing more from you on not just oculus but the future vr headsets.,Played through the game and enjoyed it. Had a bug where the bike engine sound was not present at all when I started in the highway mode and didn't come back when I went to do a race again. Would be really cool if a motocross track and bikes where added. Would for sure pay for that add on! Pretty good overall for the price.
