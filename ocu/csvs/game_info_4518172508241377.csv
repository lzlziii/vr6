Here’s what it is so far! Community- 8/10 some times you will run into little kids screaming and yelling. Graphics- 10/10 if I’m going to be honest the unique art style changes the feel of the game and I love it! Gun play- 7/10 I love the gun variety and they are all really balanced and fun to use! Just once in a while it can be a little janky! this game is one of my favorites and I absolutely love it!,"This game is really gonna go places, I've been here since public release and it's been a blast playing this game. I find it so fun and no matter how many times I get mad at it. I always come back to it. Definitely give this game a try. And hey if you see me in there say hi, and if your on the other side, well good luck cause I'm not going easy on ya!","Just tested the game for the first time it’ll take awhile to learn but once you learn it and the unique ability each character gives you its amazing well balance game guns are accurate if you can aim of course,great community Game doesn’t make much money due to it being free so i say add in some in game purchases like skins on valorant it’s a sick game and i see the huge potential.","So far, this game plays well! Developer response has been fantastic. 5v5 madness haha! I have a really good feeling that the game will be even better for official release in meta store! Keep listening Devs, and I'll keep playing!","This is really unique in the VR space and its free. The lobbies are full and active. It has a bit of a learning curve so the tutorial is a must. Its easy to get into it, but its obvious the game has a high skill ceiling as well. The buy system is interesting and so are the hero abilities. This is best played with a group of friends to coordinate on tactics. It feels soo much like valorant in VR. I had a blast playing and I can’t wait to see how the different hero abilities combine. Graphics are decent on quest although i hope VR hardware improves so the hero abilities stand out more. There is a bit of lore, which is one of my favorite parts about hero shooters and i hope that’s mentioned a bit more. Overall very satisfying and since its free why not? 5 stars."
