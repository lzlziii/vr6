Vikings,"Immerse yourself in this atmospheric, open-world Viking adventure. With an entire island to explore, a full cast of characters to interact with, challenges to solve, and wild animals to protect yourself from, this game will provide many hours of gameplay. Your home is surrounded and hopelessly outnumbered by a rival Viking lord's fleet of longboats. Your only hope is to restore an ancient magical protection which legend says was once gifted to your ancestors by the god Odin. Your goal is to restore that magical protection. It's a mission which will take you up mountain peaks and into deep underground caverns. You will ride in boats, search villages and houses, and break into mysterious caves. As well as interacting with the characters in the game, you will need to buy and upgrade weapons to fight off wild animals, unlock doors, solve puzzles and find your way past obstacles. Because the game is open world, you can take it at your own pace - meaning you can focus on exploring Viking houses, or fighting wolves, or just relax and take in the sound of the sea! The only thing you need to ask yourself before buying this game is... are you Viking enough?",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, RPG (Role Playing Games)",English,1.0.131,SnowDay,Snowday Ltd,https://snowdayonline.com/statues/,"Jun 7, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5592735617472665/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5592735617472665&r=1, https://snowdayonline.com/statues/assets/privacy.html",338.7 MB,"Am days deep into this and really enjoying the adventure. One of those made with love and care. The dev is super helpful on discord when I occasionally get stuck. A no-brainer for $5 if you like these kind of quest-laden games. Chat to folk, scavenge items and fight wolves in an open exploration world that you can also circumnavigate by boat.","This is a fun, atmospheric, good looking RPG with a cool viking environment and witty dialogue. It provides hours of entertainment for the cost of two bars of chocolate! The graphics are as good as a Quest 2 game can get, and the relative lack of polygons actually works well with the rough viking settlement style."
