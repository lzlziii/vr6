Paranormal Detective: Escape from the 80's,"As a detective specializing in unusual cases, you just found the cold case of the century! Back in 1987, Corey Savage disappeared off the face of the earth. His parents noticed the TV and Game Glove buzzing with a strange electricity... Could these objects hold the keys to this mystery? Can you solve the puzzles in this preserved game room to unlock the secret of Corey’s disappearance? Will you be transported to a retro-futuristic cyber TV world to face off against an evil villain?",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Exploration, Puzzle",English,2.2,LunaBeat,LunaBeat,http://www.lunabeat.com/,"Nov 30, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4934174439932533/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4934174439932533&r=1, https://lunabeat.com/page.php?id=privacy_policy",1.54 GB,"Overall a pretty fun escape game. Lots of references to the 80's with clever puns and design choices. I purchased this game on sale for $6.99 and I feel like I got my money's worth. Most of the puzzles are pretty straightforward, but the answers are not too easy or obvious. I was able to take a couple of shortcuts like brute-forcing combination locks once I had 3 of the 4 digits, and I was able to skip the piano puzzle completely. (Which is good because I have almost no musical talent.) I enjoyed the mini-games and challenges within the game to unlock certain clues that mix up the play style and prevent the game from being repetitive. One of the nice features is lots and lots of interactive objects in the rooms to help enrich the story and atmosphere, but aren't part of any puzzle. Having cassette tapes you can play on the radio and little toys you can play with are so important in building an immersive environment in VR. I love seeing FMV scenes in VR games, and the acting is so-bad-its-good in the best possible way and honestly fits right in with the theme of 80s movies. I laughed so hard a couple of times. TL;DR - This game is for you if you're looking for a short escape-room experience with lots of mini-games, and tons of references to 80's pop culture.","I love escape games, and I love them even more in VR. This one sits just on the lower side of average. It's got some charm, and cute moment, but it's very short. And not being able to teleport while holding things is an odd, annoying choice. As a labour of love by a one-person team, it's fun. But it's not a great example of the genre, and it's buggy. Items drop through surfaces you put them on, and sometimes just disappear in your hand in certain spaces. I'm giving it three because anyone in the genre should be encourage and I hope they do well, but it's a 2.5 from me really. It's not worth the pricetag, but I can't imagine it's viable to make a VR game with a much lower price tag.","Good escape room- in reality probably would only give this app 4 stars at the price of 10 USD (considering it has little-to-no replayablility, and could have used a couple more puzzles and some interactions are a bit clunky - there are doors that don't open, and the digital keyboard is out of tune (although not sure if this was a purposeful design choice) but there is such a lack of apps like this for the Quest 2 that I have to support (and thank) the developers for this one. Please port Escape from the 90's for the Quest 2 so that us poor people/non-PCVR people can play that one too! Thanks for porting this one.","The game is fairly short and I would have liked to see some improvement to the controls/movement but they are more than adequate as they are. Graphics are charming if a little basic and I’d like to have seen a big budget version of this game but the style does suit the 80s theme. The puzzles vary from very easy to I had to look up a guide for one of them (I’m not great at puzzles) and one I completed by pure accident. Some may rate lower stars because of the length or other reasons but I rate on my enjoyment and I had fun and it was reasonably priced. It’s maybe not as polished as some other puzzle games on the main Oculus store but I would say it deserves to be on it. It was cheap and gave me a couple of hours of fun, that’s all I really wanted. Good work"
