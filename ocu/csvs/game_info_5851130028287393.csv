Great Fun,Really Fun And Nice To Play With Friends!,"With the reference of the big screen, I did not find a benefit in this application, access to different environments? Nothing new, some motion sickness and 0 (zero) users in the app, maybe it's me, maybe I didn't understand how to do something simple like find users to interact with or maybe a lot of work ahead, good luck!",Really nice people and owners
