Great atmosphere, music, graphics, gameplay. I’m surprised there aren’t more games like this for Quest and think it deserves a place in the main Oculus store. App Lab games can be hit and miss but this one is solid, delivers what it promises and I don’t regret my purchase, even though I don’t play too often and still haven’t completed the final set of levels. If you like Coaster Combat and the shooting option on Epic Roller Coasters you should def give this one a go.","Ride a minecart tilting your body left and right avoiding stuff, I admit I didn't really think this way anything special at first beyond being well made technically. Then I decided to play it on my bean bag chair which allowed for amazing freedom to move my body and it quickly felt like I was sitting in a minecart for real. If you have the right kind of seating this game is seriously a great time.

Great shooting, great leaning/dodging and a killer soundtrack. You get a good workout while dodging lasers, debris on the tracks and some well placed doors. This game is one of my go to games when I have 20 mins to quick play something. There is no locomotion to worry about and the game looks great and runs smooth on the Quest 2. Every world is varied and has great surprises in store! Pj VR Verdict Podcast You can catch an interview with the dev on our 78th episode.

The detail in the animations of the enemies or traps are clear and smooth, I have seen no signs of any slow down even when there are a number of enemies firing on screen. The cart is constantly moving at the same pace meaning that the majority of the time you will have to keep on moving to preserve your life. Shooting mechanics are accurate and you have the addition of a shield which you access at times of being overrun, plus a choice of special weapons which are accessed from over your shoulder. The further you progress in the game the morre stars you gain which will open later levels. With 3 levels of difficulty on the 5 locations, the harder the difficulty the more enemies and obstacles you will face. This game is another brilliant example of an indie developer experimenting with some original ideas and making a really fun vr experience.","I’ve had the pleasure of playing through the first 3 levels in warchasm. It certainly becomes an intense bullet hell game. You’ll constantly be shooting, squatting, leaning and dodging your way through the levels. It’s an on rails shooter that feels like pistol whip meets space pirate trainer."
