It's like you guys sat around the meeting table and asked yourselves ""how could be upset 90%+ of the people that bought this game?"" Well, mission accomplished, guess my family and i switch back to Premium Bowling, while the play is worse, at least we can all play togetherü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",I bought this game to be able to play with multiple people here at home. Well with the new upstate you can play with more than two people which is horrible and you can‚Äôt update the names anymore. If there is not an update to bring back more players for pass n play I will never buy another game from this company,"Simple enough game that works well but is let down by the fact the camera does not work if the player is NOT the main user of the headset, you get a bleep and no image is created, it is as if the App does not have the permissions to create the photo image file for the secondary use","This game is fun and can be really entertaining. My children really like the different bowling balls we can collect and the different themes for the bowling alleys (we would love to see more). It COULD be a great family game, but as mentioned in a previous review, the 2 player limit on pass and play really let's it down. Please consider increasing this, trying to play this as a family of 4 is disappointing.","Haven‚Äôt been on there for a while but maybe they changed some things. The courses are pretty cool, and the selection of different balls with abilities is cool too. The more you level up, the more special balls you can buy. The lounge area however is maddening. To set up a game with friends was near impossible to me. Absurdly so. We would go in and out and in and out of the course because we would not be able to sync on a game, though we‚Äôd still manage to be in the lounge together. When the game does happen, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty realistic if you use a normal ball, otherwise all the ones with power don‚Äôt really create a realistic trajectory. I like that you can high five and also slap each other‚Äôs butts. So you won‚Äôt find me on there, but if you are still interested do us both a favor and use this. Just change the comma with period L I N K T R , E E / D I S C O U N T F U R Y"
