Curious Chimps,"A game inspired by Gorilla Tag. Return to Chimp. Explore the multiple environments your natural home has to offer. Run, jump and climb using only your arms, no thumbsticks, touchpads or anything. Stack on top of each other to reach new heights. Climb trees and swing around the forest. Climb walls, run on the ground, jump from branch to branch around different trees. Swim through Zero Gravity, escape Dad, fly, launch, and grapple around in the Mechanic Playground, and put your mind to the test and find out which branches are real and fake, be careful though, time is ticking and lava is rising! Why not a little adventure to satisfy that Chimp curiosity? If you aren't feeling up for it, hang out with other monkeys in the snow or forest map. And whatever you do, do NOT go to the mines.
