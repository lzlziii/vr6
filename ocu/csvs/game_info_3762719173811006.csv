I played for hours trying to top my high score. Overall this game is amazing!,"Grabbed this one to kill some time. The mechanics are pretty fun and challenging. Tested my brains ability to multitask and change colors. Perfectly named as the gun IS trash, but the rest of the game is a good way to kill some time with a unique game mechanic. Recommended.",This game is a lot of fun. Easy to learn and hard to master. The core mechanic of frantically switching the color of your lasers to match the trash is super fun and keeps your fingers frantically trying to keep up with your brain. Great game!
