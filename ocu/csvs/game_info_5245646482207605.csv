Yes it does,but,we have it for a good cause. Gorilla tag,Capuchin,Penguin Paradise,our game AND ALL Fan games of gtag have your IP’s incase you need to be IP banned.How do you think Lemming IP bans people? .Moderators I’m a moderator myself(doesn’t have vent access yet) and people are saying they aren’t doing their job. We ARE.just because you accidentally got kicked by them or did on purpose doesn’t mean they aren’t doing their job.
