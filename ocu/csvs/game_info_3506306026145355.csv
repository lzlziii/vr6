Where is cactus cowboy ww2 game????!??!!??!,The creativity is there but it’s low quality and very challenging.,"I love the game portal and portal 2. I know all of the lore. So i was hoping for this game to at least have portals with depth, but it's literally just render textures. But since you can't get portal natively on the quest, i might as well play this."
