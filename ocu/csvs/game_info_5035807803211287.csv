Glider Sim,"Glider Sim is a professional paragliding / paramotor simulator aimed at achieving realism of the actual sport. Jump into multiplayer and experience the sensation of free flight with your friends! You can core thermals up to the clouds with a paraglider or rush down steep cliffs in the speed wing! The sim currently contains 2 sceneries: Sun Valley, ID, USA and Walenstadt Switzerland (Swiss Alps) with a 3rd scenery coming soon! Scenery is derived from real world satellite imagery and overlaid with high resolution textures and dense vegetation. One of the biggest open worlds on Quest! (50 km2) Lots of attention went into the flight physics as well as the wind and thermal system. Set your launch point, glider, and flight condition. Use your VR controllers to grab the handles and lean forward to takeoff! Find ridge lift and thermals to stay airborne. You can toggle on and off wind visualization particles. Use the in-game Map / GPS to track your flight across the map. Each cell of the glider is simulated and physics applied. You can do maneuvers such as wingovers, spirals, stalls, and swoops. Watch out and don't let your wing collapse! Fly the scored challenges that help improve your flying and understand the basics of paragliding. Be sure to share / rate if you enjoy so we can continue development! (Important Note: Quest 1 users will no longer receive updates and multiplayer will no longer work after Jan 1, 2024. Future updates will be aimed at Quest 2 hardware and up.)",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer",Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Simulation","English, English (US)","2.0.8

I was to quick to put 4 stars in a very very early access. Deserves the 5. Super relaxing and fun and now with the drone option included it makes it thrilling and exciting also. I keep coming back to it. New map in Switcherland, really fun. I hope for more maps and challenges in the future, but mostly maps, maybe city maps even if they are not real cities, for the thrill of speed gliding between buildings (maybe a base jump mode? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èasking is free‚Ä¶ üòÖ) and run the drone among them‚Ä¶ changed my 4 to 5 stars, kudos to the devs for an amazing work.The physics are incredible. So worth it!","This is one of the best simulators I have ever flown. It is as close to paragliding as you can get without strapping on a paraglider and running off the side of a mountain. This simulator allows for long cross-country flights (I have flown for an hour and a half on one recent flight) or gliding along ridge fronts. You can challenge your skills in high wind or soar on the thermals on a quiet day. This simulator lets me truly fly by the seat of my pants, no one shooting at me, no missions, just flying where I want with success measured by my level of happiness and enjoyment. I recommend this simulator to those of us out there who are looking for barebones flying, no frills and total control of where you go and how you fly.","I bought the Applabs version which installs directly to the Oculus Quest 2 and boy what a waste of money! The video settings are scaled all the way down and greyed out so they cannot be adjusted. The Steam version for PC, on the other hand, will allow you to adjust the graphics based on your PC's specs (like 99% of all games out there). IF THEY HAD MADE THIS KNOWN on the sales literature, I never would have bought it! The game is terrible with the graphics turned down all the way. It's like I went back in time 20 years and I'm playing a game on my first PC with a Pentium 2 cpu, my 8 meg video card, and 256 megs of ram. I tried getting a refund and it is not allowed! Even though I played it for far less than the 2 hour window. What a ripoff.","First, i enjoy this simulation, thank you so much for developing team. And I wonder when this simulator release new version ?? I hope that glider sim launch upgraded version for oculus quest.",Brilliant way for new people and seasons vets to practice......really nice people in this group....hope it goes stronger and stronger
