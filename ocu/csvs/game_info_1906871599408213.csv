Robo Recall: Unplugged,"You used to push lead with a pencil, but now you‚Äôre pushing it with a gun. A recent barrage of defective, homicidal robots has created openings in RoboReady‚Äôs perpetually underfunded and suddenly swamped Recall Department. Thrown into the fray as a Recaller, you must rely on your wits, reflexes and a vast arsenal of weaponry to eliminate the robot uprising. Robo Recall is an action-packed VR first-person shooter with visceral gameplay and an in-depth scoring system. Earn the high score by using creative combat tactics and skill shots as you teleport through city streets and rooftops in an awe-inspiring ballet of bullets. Tear apart your interactive robot foes and use them to fend off the enemy onslaught. Unlock, customize and test weapons before taking on advanced challenges that put your newfound skills to the test!",7+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Shooting","English, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Mexico)",1.0,Drifter Entertainment / Epic Games,Oculus Studios,http://driftervr.com/roborecall,"May 21, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/1906871599408213/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=1906871599408213&r=1, https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy",Terms of Service,3.73 GB,This is genuinely a great game.

Gives a great workout without realize you‚Äôre getting a workout. Only thing missing is a machine gun. LOVE IT,"Ok, I did expect this game to be more optimized for the Quest! If you also are a Rift or Rift S user you will directly see that it‚Äôs lacking in details and dosen‚Äôt look as good as the old Rift version! But it‚Äôs a great game that needs some Love or an uppdated enhanced version! Would be great to see it supporting like Foveated rendering on the Quest Pro and utilize more memory to enhance the graphics! Maybe to be offered as an upgrade/add-on!",Great game with cool matrix style shooting that makes this game cool. Most people would enjoy this game,Best game I‚Äôve played so far.
