I know this game is still in development but just let lefties play!,This game just sucks it‚Äôs straight üçë,it‚Äôs pretty good but i‚Äôve playing this game for about 6 months and there has not been one single update to it like adjusting the position of your bat and this does help you on your swing a little bit but since then I have purchased Win reality and it‚Äôs is much much better.,"This game is so close to perfect but few things, number one all I get is foul ball, foul ball, ‚Äúthat ball is way way back that is‚Ä¶ foul‚Äù Also for home runs add a movement you could do like throw the bat or run the bases! Not a bad game, has potential. Great job"
