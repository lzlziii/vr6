It is early days and features are currently limited. The app is still unpublished as of today so expectations do need to be lowered however I am happy to give 5 stars in advance. Also for the price you won't get anything better. The team is extremely responsive to feedback and are constantly working to improve this app and make it more comprehensive for features and cases. I look forward to upcoming versions of this app. I don't doubt that medvalley become part of the future for medical training!,I love checking for the little updates each week. I have a feeling it's not going to be fleshed out enough to really help with my upcoming osce. Go team!,"The game is really impressive! You can do histories and physical exams in VR. There are some limitations but they have released updates at least every other week with more OSCEs, bug fixes, and new physical exam interactions. Also, they just added the ability to learn about certain exams and physical exam interactions so I can see how it can be really helpful to new medical learners. Give it a couple months and we might not need medical schools anymore.",The game looks great!
