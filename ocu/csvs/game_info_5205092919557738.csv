"Human Game(DISCONTINUED, READ DESCRIPTION)","This game has been discontinued due to me losing the files to it, so what did I do? I just made a better remake of Human Game but it's named Human Game Remastered. Get it on app lab, trust me it is way better than whatever this is.",3+,"Multiplayer, Single User","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Casual, Social",English,7.1,Zixed,Zixed Studios,https://sites.google.com/view/humangamevr/home,"Jul 11, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5205092919557738/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5205092919557738&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DhAcl2npDiP5btf9ANAWdCi5kBfHUlARGcZxLG-oXhs/edit",123.8 MB,I had really liked the game before it shut down. It was just a fun chill out game. But I cannot find where the game is on applab or side quest or even if there is a discord to the game. I‚Äôve searched and have ask people on tik tok who‚Äôve played the remastered version but wasn‚Äôt given any response. So if the creator could replay to this I would really appreciate it. - jrig,Hey btw can‚Äôt find your other game but it was a decent game I don‚Äôt know if you were toxic like they say but I do know you made a funny game and that‚Äôs great if you see this pls tell me how to get the other game üëç,I love this game so much sad that it is discontinued so sad such a good game üò≠,I like this game and the gun physics but I feel like this game was kind of bland and not much to do. I also had a couple bad encounters with moderators but that happens with every multiplayer game. Overall ok game and I hope that the remastered version has much more to do. P.S Also you probably have heard this a lot by now but I can‚Äôt find the remastered version is it just not out yet or is it on sidequest.,I am new and i did not be able to play it yet and i just wanted to know so when i play please respond to this owner and can i please be a moderater from kj
