On levels 3.1 3.2 the waste water receptacle bumps off and spins away into the distance, making it impossible to win or to advance. Otherwise, except for a few minor graphic glitches, a very enjoyable game. Any ideas on how to fix?","As I was gifted this I wanted to play a little more of it before I left a review to be totally fair, when I 1st played it I had a few issues with menus not being in the right place and off to the side even when I turned to look at them, this now seems to be fixed which may of been due to a console update so now the menu is easily viewable. A very simple but fun game for a while, not my usual type of game although I do enjoy puzzles the game is simply direct the flow of water using various pipes as quick as you can before it runs out. Sounds simple but can be quite tricky at times. A few updates would make this game better such as the ability to move the blocks you are filling with pipes as to make playing and viewing pipes a little easier as some pipes are further back that you need to reach to place. A good game for those that like a simple puzzle game and also for other people to improve hand to eye coordination using the quest Thanks to the developer for gifting this item for an honest review and sorry it took so long to leave this review. I feel this may be the start of good things to come by this developer and look forward to see what they come up with next.","The idea could not be more simple, use all the pipes to close the water circuit. And do it as soon as you can to get higher score, so you can move along into new levels! The game idea is great, and for the people who likes puzzles or do not have a lot of time to spent in videogames, this is a good choice. Still there are some features to be improved (e.g. more freedom when moving the playing area,) but I'm sure they will keep improving it. Congratulations to the developer team!",Great game and fun to pass time lol,"This is a great puzzle game for people who like puzzles, and who like to challenge themselves. You have to find the pattern and connect all the pipes together using all the pipe pieces available within the time limit. There's not much else to it. There's just tons of levels with each of them being harder/different. It's a little too basic for my taste, but im sure others will enjoy this kind of game. Definitely with a try for those trying to expand their Minds and challenge themselves."
