Yue's VR-FPV-Sim,"This an easy way to experience FPV drone-flights in virtual reality with Meta Quest. Flying FPV is not easy and especially for beginners very challenging. It's save to start in a simulator, before crashing hundreds of dollars of equipment in to the ground. Fly drones with or without FPV-Goggles in ""Yue's VR-FPV-Sim"". Start with the guided tutorial and learn all about the gameplay and how to control drones in ""acro-mode""! Total of 9 Maps • ""Industrial"" 1, 2 & 3 • ""Secret Testtrack"" with a driving car • ""Skilift"" with a moving seatlift • ""Hangar"" with a private-jet inside • ""Super Market"" • ""Parking Garage"" • ""Mountain"" Simulation Properties • Rigidbody Physics, parameters configurable • PID regulated simulation, parameters configurable • Hovereffect Gameplay Properties • Compatible with a gamepad • Seated or roomscale • Acrade Mode mini-game",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Gamepad","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Flying, Racing, Simulation",English,0.82,YueWorks,YueBeifong,https://yue-beifong.jimdosite.com/,"Oct 27, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4592643074113403/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4592643074113403&r=1, https://yue-beifong.jimdosite.com/privacy-policy-vr-fpv-sim/",308.7 MB,"Great game, but I wish there were several types of drones with preset physics settings (light drone, heavy drone, racing drone). I miss the ability to record results on the Industrial tracks. Racing against a ghost in the Industrial tracks would be great as well. Also, I would have liked to see a trick training area on the map - a vertical pipe.","As an AppLab app - it just works and can give you some impression. By default it uses AcroMode, which is hard for me - as it is only for roll and pitch... So always switched to CalibMode, when roll and pitch do not require opposite move to return back to neutral position. Regarding @J3ffr3y comment - from time to time, settings are broken, and a drone does not react to any command including start up. Reason - both AcroMode and CalibMode checkboxes were unchecked because of some bug with settings, so just activate one of them to make it working again.",I’d love if you could add the option to create custom stick layouts? I don’t use the standard layout on this sim so learning fpv is even harder! - would love to know if this could be an option in the future? Otherwise really impressed - it’s a great tool!,This app doesn’t work properly and it can’t be refunded. What a scam.,make manual binding of control
