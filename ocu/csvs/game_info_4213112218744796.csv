If this is early access I cannot wait for the full release! Keep up the great work!,Everything is great except for one thing the hacker role on the Mobile app constantly kicks you out of the game and then you have to start the level you were all over again other than that though this is a really fun game to play with a friend or two.,"The experience was really fun! Mechanics are really simple but I love this games were we don't need everyone to have a VR gear while still both sides have fun. It offers me something unique I didnt have and thats why Im giving It 5* Would love more of this and more mechanics being added! Also the mods on their discord are really fast and helpful, check It out!","23h. Saturday. Last 4 survivors from this double birthday were sitting outside ""on air"". We are getting sleepy and bored. I am taking out my headset! Passing my phone to my friend with the phrase:"" DO YOU COPY?"" ðŸ˜‰, while putting the glasses. This was the best 2 h. co op game with 3 hackers and one robber!!!! I hope there will be support and updates. P.s. everyone who is wearing my Quest, has passed at least 1 ""First steps ""","I enjoyed playing with a friend but the interactions between thief and hacker become repetitive fast. The game is definitely worth it at the launch price but it feels clunky in several aspects. I hope to see this grow as the concept is great and usability issues can be fixed. Creating more â€˜puzzleâ€™ diversity requires more work, though."
