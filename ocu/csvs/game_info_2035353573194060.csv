Half + Half,"Half + Half is a multiplayer game about fun & connection. The game includes five unique multiplayer spaces that are designed to help you connect with people you know, and also to connect with people you don‚Äôt, even if only for a short while. Swim in the ocean. Glide through clouds. Play human tetris with friends, or Hide & Seek where hiders are two inches tall, and seekers are as tall as buildings. Every space in Half + Half is designed to be fun, but also to make you look as ridiculous as possible in real life. Half + Half is made to be fun for you, but also fun for everyone in the same room.",3+,"Multiplayer, Co-op","Roomscale, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Social",English,1.1.2,Normal,Normal,https://halfandhalf.fun/,"Sep 12, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2035353573194060/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=2035353573194060&r=1, https://nock.game/privacypolicy",Terms of Service,563.3 MB,"Cute, fun, and relaxing!

We used to play this app a lot and had a lot of very good memories while playing. This app always calms me down but yet, i feel sad while playing it. I hope this app helps people with stress and anxiety or even helps people cure their depression. Thank you so much to the creators of this app and i hope everything and everybody is well and healthy. To the person reading this, please, take care. I dont wanna see anything nad happen to you and i truly want the best for everyone on this planet. Im sorry this isnt about the app, but i just wanted to share my thoughts with you all. That being said, once again, thank you and goodbye."
