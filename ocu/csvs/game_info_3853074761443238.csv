I uninstalled the demo, Re booted Quest and re=installed the game but I'm just getting the demo version. What am I doing wrong?","I originally got the demo of this and enjoyed it so purchased the full version. I’m giving this 5 stars because I’d like to encourage more games like this. As is, this is very cute but with some bugs and oriented too much towards children. However, it’s such a refreshing concept to bring into VR and I would love to see another version oriented more towards adults in the near future. I think there are a lot of unnecessary bells and whistles. It does seem oriented to children in the full version which is fine but I’d love to see a more streamlined version for adults. It could be marketed as a sort of meditation/relaxation/brain exercise app. If there were various choices of pretty skyboxes, maybe beautiful nature spots like Supernatural instead of all the 3D assets and a simple game board, maybe with varying shapes and a LOT more choices of themes, this would definitely be a five star app. VR doesn’t need to be all action, shooting, killing and this could be a great relaxation app or for elderly to their keep mind sharp or those in a wheelchair or people like me who like to play this in bed before sleep to wind down and relax. Also a great addition to hopefully another version of this would be the ability to reset the view to optimize its use while lying down in bed. I REALLY hope the devs would create this other version of the app. I would buy it in a heartbeat! As cute as the 3D modeling is in this, I don’t think it’s really needed unless marketed toward children. Also I would drop the shooter mini game, it’s completely unnecessary. The fun facts are enjoyable but glad they can be turned off. There are several bugs as well including the game ending and congratulating you when there is still another word left. Also found a bug in the library when the author Walcott was diagonal it wouldn’t let me select the second T so it was impossible to finish this board. I really do hope the devs consider another streamlined version of this as described, dropping the 3D assets and shooter game and instead have maybe 50 different themed word puzzles, choice of maybe 20 skyboxes and music choices and future DLC of more game boards, skyboxes, music, some paid and some free updates. VR needs more relaxing games like this that you can play lying down in bed before sleep but still letting you use your brain a bit.","included in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-5q5Zx7n3E A wordsearch in VR might seem like a silly idea on paper, that is until you see the words you find start to change the map around you. While not every level has that feature the polish and details are all over the place and there are some shmup segments (classic shooter like space invaders) to keep things from getting dull as well as fun facts. It all comes together as a package that feels way too good for what it is and I have no problem with someone going the extra mile with their game."
