Unstung,"Command a swarm of cute bees as they grow & defend flowers against an army of hungry bugs. You control the Queen, buzzing near bees to select them, drawing zig-zag lines through the air for the bees to follow. Help the meadow bloom by bringing pollen to flowers, making new bees, and always - protecting the hive from the evil, nosy Lord Mothmer and his bug minions! Unstung will make you feel like a really busy queen bee! You'll be buzzing and zigging all around the meadow to keep your little bees working. There are many ways to play - you could collect a huge swarm of hundreds of bees, and zoom around eliminating bugs - or you could set up a busy network of pollination to keep your flowers in tip-top shape! Well, what are you waiting for - the bees need you!",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Strategy",English,1.3.0,Studio Tonkin,Studio Tonkin,https://www.studiotonkin.com/,"Apr 12, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3547359935372362/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3547359935372362&r=1, https://studiotonkin.com/privacy-policies/",241.1 MB,,,,,This game is very fun and i enjoy playing it.

Great job on the game. I look forward to more!
