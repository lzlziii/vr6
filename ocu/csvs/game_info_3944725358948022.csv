Jentrix,"Meet Jentrix! It is inspired by the famous board game and combines the very best of Jenga, match-3 and Tetris. And it‚Äôs all packed in Virtual Reality! We are pretty sure you know the classic Jenga, but what if instead of wooden blocks there would be colorful fruit cubes, the towers would grow every second, and crocodiles would try to bite your hands? Jentrix mixes different sets of mechanics from everyone‚Äôs favorite games. Jenga provides its well-known look of the tower and tests your physical and mental skills. Match-3 brings its popular 3-in-a-row portion, while Tetris vibes will put you to the edge while the tower grows. It‚Äôs Jenga you‚Äôve never seen before!

It has its own twist, flavor, and delivery‚Ä¶ and it is good. There is only one thing that keeps this game out of my regular rotation - when you place a block and let go of the trigger, it can get ‚Äújumpy‚Äù sometimes. Surgical precision will be met with a result that shakes the entire stack. Sometimes a jolt will send everything to the ground, and you are left restacking at a critical moment. This will happen even after you have got over the learning curve. If there were an option to soften that jolty occurrence, this would be an incredible experience. I play this game in a well-lit environment, with fresh batteries in the controllers.","Fantastic Remix on the classic board game Jenga, Jentrix takes everything I love about that and adds some fun extras like throwing at the birds and lining up combos. Add in that its well made both controls and in regards to being graphically pleasing and this is a game I can easily recommend to fans of puzzle games or Jenga. featured in - https://youtu.be/Naxha7wgbDQ","I didn‚Äôt expect the game to be so engaging. At first this seemed liked some experimental project for kids, but I quickly got carried away laying out fruits. It‚Äôs impossible to quit playing. The world of Jentrix is very beautiful and the gameplay is interesting. My friends and I were laughing out loud when one of us got buried under the fruit pile, but still tried to hold the virtual tower with his hands. An excellent choice for an amusing pastime.","I bought this game not knowing what it would be like. But I had so much fun playing this game, also the Alligator üêä made me jump when I got to close to it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to have lots of fun."
