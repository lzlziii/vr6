There are so mangy places to explore and it‚Äôs really relaxing. It is quite easy to catch fish and the people that break lines are just dumb so don‚Äôt listen to them. There is also more than just fishing there is treasure hunting and that‚Äôs rlly fun. Also you can play MULTIPLAYER which is rlly cool. Also the fish are so unique and funny and In my opinion it is not repetitive and I am always excited when I catch new fish! I hope someone reads this and has their mind changed because this game it worth it!,"When I first got the Quest 2, I got this game as one of my first ever games to get on the headset. I got pretty far on it and I really liked how simple it was. There wasn‚Äôt too much to worry about. Just having fun with going fishing. I wasn‚Äôt able to get the ending because it became really difficult at the end just to get the last fish you need to complete the game. But it‚Äôs one of those games where I would show somebody that‚Äôs just getting into vr","On the icy map in multiplayer there is a boat that says ‚ÄúFishing Tours‚Äù Make that where the boat drives around all the maps and that you can fish off boats and you can catch sharks, crabs ,catfishes ,and normal fish, again this is a idea. But this would be cool if you guys did! And also keep up the good work!",It's a good game you would think it's boring but it's actually pretty fun once u get the hang of it the one thing I wish was is in the game is something kind of crazy but I think it would make the game SUPERRRR FUNNNN were u have a vr family or with friends and u have to catch fish and cook (ik u can already fish) it would be so fun I would put a 10m star revive if I could dev pls see this and consider adding like a mode multi-player or single player with robots if u do single player LIKE THIS SO HE CONSIDERS IT ITS WOULD BE SUCH A COOL MOOD PLS,"Better than I expected. Looks and works well. Can get several hours of play out of it. Multiplayer areas are nice but not heavily populated. Most people don‚Äôt mind if you join in and fish quietly. Only have had one person get a little obnoxious when people weren‚Äôt responding to their voice chat. You are rewarded with rarer fish for leveling up your equipment, which you can earn by fishing more. Really shocked the developers provided this game for free. Give it a try."
