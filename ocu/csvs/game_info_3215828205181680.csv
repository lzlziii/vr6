The feel is perfect and i have so much fun doing all the challenges. The difficulty progression is very well done and when i get stuck i can just hop in a different plane and do challenges over there. I also like what they did with the limited graphics capability of the quest2. They went with like a mario 64 type of look which is very fun and looks great. Would love if they added a co op mode and passenger / instructor and trainee mode,"Lots of great games out there but for my money, after you've been standing for hours playing Beat Saber or Pavlov, best game to play sitting down is Ultra Wings 2... big baby! That'd what we used to say at my school to get it hype... aaaanyway. Yeah it's so fun. It's more fun when you don't buy infinite gas and ammo.","There's an annoying bug that won't let me interact with the plane's engine start toggle. All the other switches and levers produce haptic feedback when your hand gets near it but no such feedback happens near the engine start. No matter what I do, I can't get my finger to point. I've physically pointed making sure I'm not touching the trigger with my actual hand and the vr hand remains useless. I've confirmed the capacitative touch on the trigger is working because in the Quest menu, my virtual hands respond as I take my finger off and on the trigger. Tried deleting and reinstalling the app, but that lost all my progress and I don't feel like re-doing the challenges I've already beat. It was fun while it worked, but definitely wasn't worth paying for. You win some, you lose some, glad it wasn't more expensive.",Definitely needs more planes for sure maybe one with a yoke system instead of them all having flight sticks also a mode you can just fly around with friends would be awesome there is no other game you can just enjoy flying with friends in so if they did this that would make this game huge and they can make lots of money they have so much potential but they really need to add more to the game add things no other games have and they will be a huge hit,Want to save 25 use this link below bio link/z7xnrbhh Remove space and put (.)
