Gym Masters,"Welcome to town, rookie! This is Gym City, the mecca of fitness, where every citizens’ focus is health and hardcore exercise. Each inhabitant is a whole different person, but there is something everyone has in common - the ambition of building the most admirable gym on the planet, and sharing it with the community. Every citizen wants to prove their capacity. Are you ready to prove yours? This is your journey to success. Each master will have a set of mini games ready for you to play, the more progress you make, the tougher the mini games get: faster-paced, harder movements and more physically demanding. You don’t always have to let the masters set the pace, you can also improve at your own pace. Whenever you unlock a new minigame, you will be able to replay it as many times as you like, to improve your skill, getting fitter, or just enjoying the scene! And remember, you will achieve new objects to improve your gym and build the best looking one anyone have ever seen.",3+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Sports",English,0.9.15,Vifit Training,Vifit Training,https://vifit.training/gym-masters/,"May 24, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3568106689962388/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3568106689962388&r=1, https://vifit.training/politica-de-privacidad/?lang=es",682.4 MB,"I had high hopes for it because i liked the concept but when i started playing it had input lag and frame delay in the minigames, now i understand if you guys are hobbyists or new to vr but it does need some work. I play perfectly fine on pistol whip so i expected to do fine on this since i was good enough on reaction timing but it just didnt work out that way. Ill be leaving my review at 3 for now but i will probably move it up later on especially if theres huge improvement as it updates. Thank you if you read this.",Game is great. It’s literally not out so I don’t understand why people have such high expectations. Good quick workout if you need it. I’m exited for the full release,"you can tell that there is definitely potential in the game, but a lot of the controls don't seem to work properly and the tracking is off on quite a bit",This game really need some kind of tutorial to figure out what to do in first place! But you could be your own and play with some gyms and minigames this game has They are pretty cool but you have to be precise to make these moves and everything so they work out better! Also jumping jacks type of minigame is not working for me. I tried to do it right but no go. Edit: I mean walktrough from beginning but there is Good tutorials In minigames,It seems i have stumbled across a glitch to build thungs in my gym claiming i have not completed the task even though i have.
