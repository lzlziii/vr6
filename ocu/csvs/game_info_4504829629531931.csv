Love everthing . Waiting for the second part.,"What Ivanovich Games delivers here is the absolute crowning glory. Operation Warcade had already impressed me and Beat Blaster is also a great experience, but 2076 Midway Multiverse plays even more with the perspectives and opens up completely different dimensions for me as a shooter fan. The expanded 2D shmup environment paired with game elements from a strafox/space harrier and even a real futuristic flight sim blew my mind at first and still puts a big grin on my face that I can hardly ever stop playing it. There is also a great high score hunt, trashy but funny story with great movie anecdotes, great effects, a long gaming experience and non-stop action. Edit: Unfortunately I have to retract my 5-star rating: in level 9 at the final boss nothing happens at all. The eye stares at me, but I can't do anything. I've tried it several times now. I also reinstalled the game, replayed it from the beginning and also reset my Quest 2: no change.",Where can I buy the rest of the game because I can’t find it on the app and it only lets me into level one before level 2 a trailer plays but so far I love the game play and I would recommend it,How do you carry on with the other in this game on arcade mode it won't let me.,"This game is the classic midway shooter. Looks good, plays good! Yes it has a wonky mechanic but nothing you cannot get used to. For free the games is a must!"
