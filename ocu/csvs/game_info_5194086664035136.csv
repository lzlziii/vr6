Relaxed spiders experience,"In this experience you find yourself in an environment with friendly spiders. Observe and interact with the creatures. Admire the stunning graphics and scenery. The spiders are curious about you and want to know more about you. They are gentle and harmless. You feel a sense of peace and calm in their presence. You are free to explore this environment and spend time with the spiders as you wish. To achieve greater immersion we recommend to use the build in hand tracking instead of the Oculus controller. For now this experience is an early access version and will be further improved with more spiders, other insects, and more interactions. You really help us to improve the experience as an early adopter and we are more than open for new ideas, criticism and feature requests.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Simulation",English,1.1,Bonemose,MaskedHouseStudios,http://www.maskedhousestudios.com/,"Dec 13, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5194086664035136/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5194086664035136&r=1, http://www.maskedhousestudios.com/privacy-policy/",485.2 MB
