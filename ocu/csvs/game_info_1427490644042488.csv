And here’s keykeys and Kena!￼ getting straight nine’s almost and Goku here they are saying it’s even less bright? Just like Jason’s hints tips and strategies haven’t ￼even ended!?,"most boring game ever .Waited over 30 min to go to next level. total boring, time waster. give me my refund.","Would actually like to know what the girl is saying. Most puzzles are really hard in a way that I can’t possibly finish them without trial and error, which means a sad end for the girl too. This shouldn’t make sense, there should at least be a few chances for mistakes before the girl gets killed. Hurting yourself is one thing, hurting a helpless kid is another. That’s all with the ranting, but the rest of the game i find them interesting enough to venture through.","So basically the game is about you being strapped to a wheel chair and you have to guide a little girl to solve puzzles and if you fail the girl dies and then you die, and there are many endings to this game. I tried to request a refund because I didn’t like the game but it was not approved and I don’t know why but it makes me mad because I don’t want the game anymore.","I rarely write bad reviews - if I don't like a game, other's might. That's ok. But this game is different: It's designed around watching a helpless little girl die brutally over and over again. Why does a game like that even exist?"
