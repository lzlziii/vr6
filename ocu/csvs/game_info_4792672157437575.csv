Kitesurfing VR,"Kitesurfing is an extreme sport. It is quite complex and requires some advanced skills to practice it. You can get impression of what it looks like, have some fun, face the obstacles, perform some jumps.

I'm using the app to start learning kite before going to the real water.... Very happy. ( P.s. to start click in B+Y at the same time.)","I wish I could understand how to control. There is no tutorial and I am not even sure what to do. Maybe it would be nice to have an easy mode (aka the game either tell you what to do, or help you control the kite) and realistic mode..."
