Pros: - Value for money (spent many hours playing already) - Super chill vibes and a blast to fly down the mountain - Courses are super fun with good variety - Fun cabin home environment Cons: - Tracking seems funky sometimes - Doing some tricks is super tough and glitchy. It seems like there are almost too many grab points making it harder to nail certain tricks. Ex. Trying to grab behind the board poses a lot of issues. - Board ends up behind you a lot of the time and no good way to reset positioning when already going down the mountain. I only mention the criticisms in hopes that some of these things can be ironed out a little more because I really like the game and I would easily bring it to a 5 with some minor tweaks. The unlockables are super fun to get. Love picking the board and selecting the music. Overall the game is super polished and fun.","I read all the negative reviews prior to buying a game. I‚Äôm not sure I understand what these ones were about honestly. I tried to understand but fail to see what they meant. 1. The game is intuitive and wonderfully executed, and it makes me excited for the possibility of skateboarding games to follow the VR world. 2. I find that jumping and grabbing your board is intuitive. 3. I feel exhilarated and the possibilities of one run bring you many different challenges. 4. I snowboarded in my youth casually. 5. While I‚Äôm busy all the time with life and the VR apps I have. While I have over 60 of them, each is totally unique on its merits and each experience is widely different then the next. I honestly don‚Äôt have multiples of anything. Which means this is the only snowboarding game I own on the Oculus. 6. The mechanics are exciting. Try the ski game on the AppLab. The mechanics are intuitive and demand motion! It reminds me that these type of games, snowboarding and skateboarding and skiing have an exciting future on the VR world. 8. Use the 14 day refund, it works great if you have not played the game for over an hour (I believe? I returned only one game before) and there really is no risk involved. I found out that I really liked it more than I thought I would. It‚Äôs a real pleasant surprise, but I shouldn‚Äôt be so surprised seeing as the VR world continues to stun me. Thanks guys! Thanks a lot! I hope this is not spamming you as it‚Äôs on the bottom of the review, but should you find this helpful, please consider using my lnk below.

So whenever I try to play a game, I want to try to unlock everything in advance so I can fully get a feel for everything that the game has to offer. As I am writing this review, I have the night line level unlocked and the only way to keep progressing is I need to get 2 medals in the night line level. So the game gives you two options of medals you could collect, you could either do timed challenges where you have to get to the goal before a certain time frame, or you could do freestyle mode where you can try to get 10,000 points or do certain tricks, (key word, try). Sometimes you could do both. Here's where the problems begin, you could try to do the time attack challenges but the game doesn't give you any tips on how to go faster AT ALL. So you would try to do the freestyle challenges. In order to do any tricks, your best bet is to raise your arms with the index triggers held and your board will spin around doing a BP 100 or BP360 and so fourth depending on how long you can hold it for until you land on the ground correctly... The spinning board only works whenever it feels like, just like the quest pro controller tracking. So ok, I have been trying to rack up as many points as possible, and because the board chooses whenever it feels like functioning, I decided to go for the other medal in the night line level, do a rusty trombone. This should be easy since it's just one trick. The problem is, the game doesn't tell you how to do ANY of the tricks, so I go into the option where it ""tells you"" how to do the tricks. So you are thrown into a level and on the left side it shows your board and it tells you ""do a BP 360"" this is not a bad one considering that this is the only trick I could do, considering that it's the only cut and dry thing I can do aside from grabbing my boaifor no real reason. Then it tells you to do a Lein drop. You have to grab the back right side of the board. It doesn't tell you which side to land on, it doesn't tell you how to do anything other than the part you're supposed to grab. So I can't have the game tell me how to do a rusty trombone, or anything, and on top of that, you are trying to grab a part of the board and 80% of the time your hand doesn't grab the part of the board you want and then all of a sudden you run into a tree or a rock and snow gets in your face. And when you ARE grabbing the part of the board and when you are about to jump, you don't even care about the level you just want to know how to get the positioning right, you are stopped in your tracks because there's a level right in your face. I wish the tutorials on how to do tricks were not so vague, I wish that there is a cut and dry way to gain speed and I wish the game would TELL you how to gain speed, and I wish that everything wasn't so vague.",Pretty cool game But the music in this game absolutely sucks! You would think they would have more options/ genres to choose from because it's hard to carve up when you're listening to some crappy hippy /elevator type music,"I have snowboarding for a little bit now and I can‚Äôt say that this game feels good when we don‚Äôt have snow in here. Only problem is the sprint race; there are times like 6s appearing and I can‚Äôt understand how and why someone would do such times in a race. In overall, this is a fabulous game and I recommend to snowboard lovers and non lovers."
