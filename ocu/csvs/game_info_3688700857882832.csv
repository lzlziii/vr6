Healium,"Beautiful, nature-based escapes powered by your imagination. Float through a crystal forest, feel a healing rain wash over you, or sit quietly in a field of sunflowers. Virtually travel to Mauii, listen to the rustle of a bamboo forest and the ocean waves lapping at your feet. Experience different colors of healing, trace a mandalynth, or glide through a breath-taking fractal. Use your feelings of focused calm to make the flurries fly inside a magic snow globe. Sit quietly inside a zen garden. Grow leaves on a 150-year-old Burr Oak tree with your memories of being still. Healium is a walk in the park for those times when you can't physically take a walk in the park. In four peer-reviewed journals, Healium has been shown to improve mood in as little as four minutes. Connect an optional EEG meditation headband to make a firefly rise and fall with your feelings. Healium is a reminder that our thoughts have power to control things not only in the virtual world but the real world as well.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Relaxation/Meditation, Travel",English,3.1.3,Healium,Healium,https://www.tryhealium.com/,"Apr 22, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3688700857882832/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3688700857882832&r=1, https://www.tryhealium.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,206.9 MB,"The link to buy doesn't go to purchase page, so I'm unable to buy","Healium has been extremely effective for me and has been one of my favorite VR apps to date, if you haven't tried it yet I suggest giving it a chance at least once!","This is as good or better quality than anything I’ve downloaded from the Store. It was easy enough to download from the app lab just not sure why it’s there. It’s very polished, looks great, functions great. Why review a free app? Because Meta/Quest has made it that we can never ever ever delete anything from our library ever. So maybe some people are like me and are a bit discerning about which free apps they’ll try. No need to worry with this one, it’s a keeper. It’s a number of incredibly immersive, brief, guided meditation experiences. If you’ve had trouble making meditation a habit, or are just getting a bit lazy with it, this app is fantastic. You’re instantly in the zone. I also bought the Brainlink device out of curiosity so paid for the subscription version of the app at about $US10/month to use with that. It’s pretty fun and has applications for improving mental fitness through the visual neurofeedback. It’s not as sensitive as I expected but that’s just as likely me needing more practice with it. So if mind control via the Brainlink can take over from the controllers or hand tracking in future, I’ve got a bit of training to do ;) I experienced some confusion re logging in to the paid version of the app but the developers were easy to communicate with and very helpful.",Unable to buy a subscription or brainlink via the website finally had to get the app on google play and subscribe via google play even so still cannot get the website purchase page to function using multiple different browsers on different devices,I came from tryhealium.com that offers a monthly suscription. Is healium free or not?
