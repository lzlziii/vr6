Honestly one of the best VR guns I’ve ever had an experience with. However there are three extra parts of this game that say they are coming soon. I’m cool with that too. But I downloaded this and played it over a year ago definitely longer and no additional content has been released or teased to my knowledge. It’s upsetting to see because VR is such a good Avenue for historical experiences which isn’t been used by anyone.,Please developers if you can make a team battle multiplayer and add more guns like the blunder buss and the musket with a bayonet if you can and cannons and the musicians with drums also please make the blunder blunder buss able to use trash as ammo like broken nails cause a blunder buss can use a trash as a weapon and add swords to if you run out of ammo please and thank you if you read this hood game by the way,The game was solid in the reload and role play of a civil war duel but I feel like the game has been abandoned after so little content even though it’s been out so long,"The physics and movement of the gun and player felt smooth, it is great if you want to shoot and reload an old flintlock. Overall the game is awesome despite so little content, I hope there will be more!"
