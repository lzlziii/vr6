YOYO CRICKET,"Note: To play this game, you need to contact our support team first. Please reach out to us for further assistance. Game description The most exciting form of cricket is Beach cricket.

No Ball (bowler crossing the line) not taken seriously.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Sports",English,2.1.2,6DOF Studios,6DOF STUDIO,https://yoyocricket.com/,"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5478679402181809/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5478679402181809&r=1, https://yoyocricket.com/privacy-policy/",992.4 MB,Game does not start.. It asks for a coupon and if you don't have a coupon it asks for a email id which it does not accept.. There is nothing to enter an underscore ( _) in the email.. And if you enter an email id which does not have a ' _ ' still it does not accept that email.. At least provide the coupon for the game when you are in developing stage,"This game will ask for an email then won’t accept it. But if you somehow manage to get past the email stage, it will ask for a coupon which I don’t even know how to get or even if you can get one so I wouldn’t recommend wasting your time on this game.",Still is very early stages if the game but from this stage to completely awesome stage doesn’t seem to be far. Waiting for a full on multi player game — Santhinesh
