I had no idea I would enjoy it as much as I do. The locations are so vibrant and gorgeous! I cannot wait to unlock more!! And the fish, omg, they are so unique and adorable! The sounds make catching so much more thrilling!! Gameplay is smooth as silk. I have played for a few hours now and have not had any issues which is rare upon release! Hats off to the developers!! The controls are familiar as other VR fishing games and you can fish one handed as well. You collect items with each fish you catch and get rewards for completing mini missions alone your journey in the galaxy. You use these items to craft items like lures to keep advancing. You can decorate and unlock things to personalize your aquarium on your ship to make it one of a kind. This is an awesome game for all ages!","If Bait and Real VR Fishing had a beautiful, weird little baby, it would be this game. Great mechanics, fantastic tutorial, utterly charming narrative, great characters. And though I haven't gotten far, the fish and the environments are fantastic. Imaginative and a lovely escape. It also allows for single-handed gameplay. I hope multiplayer is in the works! What a fun game and a terrific addition to the library.","This game is not only extremely fun, but has some of the best graphics I‚Äôve ever seen. Each unique creature has so many details that it must‚Äôve taken years to design. I highly recommend this game for people of all ages who are looking to have a fun time. I especially recommend it to those who appreciate detail.","Galactic Catch is an incredibly immersive VR fishing game that takes me on a delightful journey through unique interstellar landscapes. The attention to detail is astonishing, from the vibrant aquatic life to the stunning cosmic backdrops. The intuitive controls make casting and reeling in a breeze, while the variety of fish species keeps every catch exciting. With its relaxing gameplay and visually stunning environments, Galactic Catch is a must-play for both fishing enthusiasts and virtual reality fans","I gave this 4.75 stars, because I have a couple suggestions that could help push this over the top... I desperately try not to compare games, but I'd be lying to you and to myself if I didn't admit this was highly reminiscent of a few games I already LOVE... but they are combined into 1 solid game in a fantastical world here. Leaving out other game names here, I will refer to features. Instead of trophies, this has missions and it does have three aquariums that you can decorate differently and add 40 fish into each one (120 fish total). There is even a setting for one-handed reeling but I didn't see any options for left-handed play. If you've ever played other VR fishing games, then you won't have anything new to learn when it comes to the controls. The gameplay is quite similar. Even the menus were familiar, but there are some minor improvements. For example, I love that we can unlock new items to put in our aquarium or in our gear/tackle box but we are not automatically awarded them. We have to earn resources while fishing and then we can craft those items for use in our ship or our tackle box. In that manner, it felt a little bit like another popular island game that Nintendo released. There are multiple map locations on multiple planets so I feel like this game could go on forever. This is gonna be a great addition to my fishing games, because the whimsy and joy are unmatched. This deserves its own space right up there on top with the big league games. Now for some constructive feedback: Having 2 separate settings menus was a bit misleading. At the opening, the ""settings"" is for language only. Inside the game settings (the menus where your gear is stored), you can enable one-handed reeling (thank goodness - accessibility features are SO appreciated!). I couldn't manage to find left-handed play (read the end of this for a correction), nor could I switch controllers simply by pulling my left trigger. I also wished the tutorials were a bit more indepth. It took me 3-4 tries before I truly understood how to make the turbo option work. Either way - this is fun for ALL AGES and is endlessly playable. I hope the missions never end as I love having small goals to make the gameplay rewarding every time I play. Correction on left-handed option: I was attempting to swap hands with the rod in hand. After reaching out to the developers for help, I received the following response: ""You can grab the rod while it‚Äôs in the stand with your left controller."" So I just may have needed to put it down first. Will try it out next time I power up my headset."
