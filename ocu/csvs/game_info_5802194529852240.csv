Island Universe,"Take a relaxing journey across the astral plane and explore imaginary dreamscapes in Island Universe. Island Universe is a ""Walking Simulator"" experience where players explore a variety of surrealistic dream locations with no objective. Explore abstract landscapes fragmented by memory, visit tranquil islands scattered through time, and rediscover the forgotten ruins of the dreamworld. •Explore over two dozen unique and surreal island-sized dreamworlds. •Traverse the astral plane with free flying movement. •Meet other travelers along your journey offering insights on the experience of life and dreams. •Immersive electronic, vaporwave, and ambient soundtrack providing a relaxing and meditative experience. •Supports seated and standing play, snap turn, smooth turn, and one-handed accessibility. Island Universe is created by a solo developer. Though this is technically a full release, future updates are planned for bug fixes, adding more polish and additional worlds to explore. Island Universe is not a story-based puzzle game with heavy interaction, but more of an abstract art piece based around dreams and imaginary places. Everybody dreams. But what if the places we imagine in our minds actually exist somewhere beyond the cosmos in some parallel world?...",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Adventure, Casual, Flying",English,1.0.6,islanduniverse.3D,islanduniverse.3D,https://islanduniverse.mailchimpsites.com/,"Jul 2, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5802194529852240/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5802194529852240&r=1, https://islanduniverse.mailchimpsites.com/privacy-policy",2.04 GB,I've played this game since it's first alpha release and I have enjoyed it so much.
