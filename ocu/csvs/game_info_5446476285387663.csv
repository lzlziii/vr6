Stop scrolling There is nothing down here This is getting weird now HAVE U LEARNT ANY MANNERS FINE! Take some golden eggs then,"Worth full price Or get it 25 prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot, and remove the spaces): b i t , l y / n o m o r e r a i n b o w s Love this game. Best use of arm based locomotion anywhere on the Quest! Love a game that was great when released AND gets updates! New go up mode (new version every week!) and multiplayer are both fun, but base campaign alone is well worth the money.",This is a truly good game I've seen many people rating the game bad because all you do is defeat white blobs but you have to defeat white blobs and but it's a Platformer a very good platformer there Is even climbing with your claws the movement is what makes this different from other platformers you can move with your hand use 2 of your hands at the same time to do a long jump the worlds and levels are greatly designed and are perfect also the worlds are designed like levels so you must do a little bit of parkour to get to the next level and by the time I'm writing this review the TESTING ZONE IS COMING TO NO MORE RAINBOWS so even more Content,I genuinely love this gam I’ve bin and playing since bata and the full game came out I didn’t really play it because it costed but then I saw the trail so I got and I had a lot of fun If u haven’t bought the game buy it or use the trial if u are thinking nothing else Stop scrolling There’s nothing else There is nothing else u don’t believe me,The devs are amazing and the graphics are amazing the game is really good and has a really good story mode your campaign multiplayer is fun I normally destroy lobbies there's a free unlockable skins and updates come regularly if you don't have no more rainbows definitely get it
