It is pretty much the only game I play on the Quest2 since I started playing this game eight months ago. I know that there are a lot of glitches but I also know that the developers had some employment issues so I am being patient and waiting for them to fix them. What I love most about the game is the community that has developed around it and the competition within. It‚Äôs a lot of fun to play especially when you get into adding parties and doing custom games. A lot of great people play this game and it is a ton of fun, so much so that, the hours flyby without even knowing how long you‚Äôve been on the game!",I was waiting like 30 mins to get in a game playing with these sweaty ahh AI‚Äôs me my friend got 5-0 with some AI‚Äôs take this down don‚Äôt even try anymore give up‚ò†Ô∏è ain‚Äôt nobody this boring ahh game lame ahh game YALL can‚Äôt get 2 people out of the 579 reviews heck nah f that step up your game‚Ä¶tell the developers to stop putting reviews to make it seem like it‚Äôs a good game,"This is a good game, It‚Äôs fun to play and has good mechanics once your used to it. Although it does have bugs and glitches. Sometimes going against players from different regions can ruin the experience due to glitches and lag. Now this goes out to all who have read Alex‚Äôs review and Alex themself. I can assure you that there is no ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù within the game whatsoever. First off the devs of the game don‚Äôt even play the game much, like I‚Äôve never seen a dev in game. They Also don‚Äôt play competitively as it is against there company policy. There is also no fake banning players. There is a player named Dary who will always leave a match before it starts just to avoid losing points. This ruins the experience for some and isn‚Äôt fun. So people have reported them. Also the ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù you have experienced is simply just glitches and bugs within the games. Sadly there are still many bugs that need to be fixed but hopefully one day they will. But I can assure you that there is zero hackers and zero manipulation.","I coach my older cousin in this game - even though I suck at it - so she can get better and she plays against AIs and she is awesome at it. Let‚Äôs gooooooooooooooooo, update more please!!?","I have been enjoying this game and been in the competitive 100 ranked place. But recently it consistantly fails to join after I found match and resulted in losing my rank. Otherwise, all those options of types of match and costume realy are enjoyable"
