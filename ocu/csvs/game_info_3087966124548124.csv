You have to find clues. It's a slow start, but once you really start picking up those clues, rooms change, doors change, hidden doors are discovered, and the jump scares really start popping, even causing some screams in our household!! We love this game and have not regretted purchasing it. I was iffy on purchasing because of other reviews, but I personally think it's worth having if you like a good mystery with a scare.","Overall I like this game. I let the negative reviews keep me from it for a while, but when it went on sale I decided to finally try it. If you enjoy haunted house walkthroughs but with more interaction (e.g. picking up clues, solving the occasional puzzle) i think you will enjoy this game. It does drag on for a bit but you keep encountering new situations and learn more about the story so that was fine with me. There are a couple glitches. A few times it was really difficult to open a door which was frustrating and twice i was somewhat stuck in the floor, but when i physically took a step or 2 the game resumed as normal. The decor seems like a copy paste job with encountering the same paintings and drawer contents room after room so i found that a bit disappointing. There are a lot of jump scares. Don’t forget to look up and behind you as things change a lot and you get to see some interesting things. The telephone part was probably my favorite part and the bathroom scene was cool.",Purchased this yesterday and half way through Good for the money if you like scares not spoiling Definitely worth it Thanks to the great devs of the game they need to make more horror games,I am stuck i a room near the beginning of the game and I can’t get out !!!! I found the combination for the locked box but I wont let me put in the code .at first I thought it was me so I changed the batteries on my controllers and it still doesn’t work I regret buying this game I was so excited to play now I am giving up and am so disappointed also as I read the reviews as u get farther in the game there are more glitches to come I am so sad and wish I could get my money back ..,"I'm an old player of Layers of Fear, and I find that the Layers of Fear on Quest is very exciting. However, when I started the game, I noticed that some of the models' UVs are strange and the static lighting seems broken. Therefore, I hope that INCUVO can fix these issues to enhance the gaming experience."
