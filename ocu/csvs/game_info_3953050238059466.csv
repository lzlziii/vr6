Oxygen Dreams,"Oxygen Dreams is a voxelized FPS/ Platform game. In his dreams, Evan is still a child. In his dreams he remembers remote places, deserts of colors, melodies and strange creatures ... a world where his fantasies and nightmares come true. No, it is not a feeling of nostalgia ... in this world he always has the certainty that growing up is ... boring.",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Adventure, Exploration",English,1.09,Fguillotine,Fguillotine,https://stmania2010.wixsite.com/fguillotinevr,"Mar 30, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3953050238059466/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3953050238059466&r=1, https://stmania2010.wixsite.com/fguillotinevr/politica-de-privacidad",233.0 MB,"Looking at price you should know what to expect, this is an 1 hour indie game with simple mecanics, platforming with a bunch of classic puzzles and a little (very little) of shooting. However, considering that it's a fun and joyful experience, the guy knows how to make something decent. Snap turning only.","App Lab Reviews - Oxigen Dreams (Oxygen Dreams) Video Review - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ovQC5c1Kb0 I enjoyed this voxels styled platforming game for the most part. It has great level variety not repeating puzzles, and feels like a complete game. With all that being said when I reached the ending I didn't feel like it was a long game but I was more then satisfied with what was there. The game is one of those things you can tell if your going to like pretty quickly and I will warn you the combat or shooting parts are so minimal if not for the puzzle aspect it introduces I would say its entirely pointless to include as it never reached a point where it offered any challenge what so ever. I also find when your moving forward you cant use analog stick to alter your direction so you really need to line up jumps properly as one missed jump leads to repeating the stage from the start. Anyways I would say its a good game for the most part for those who enjoy first person platforming and if your in that small group and your interested in this title I think its worth getting.",A beautiful game that you should not miss .. I finished it in Oculus Go and now I will do it again It is a pleasure to travel to those dream worlds ...,"I really loved this game on the go, but to play it properly on my Quest 2 is on another level. Great little app."
