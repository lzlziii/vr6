Revria,"Revria is a single-player immersive simulation of life in an open, living star system. Lovingly crafted just for Quest, with a focus on realistic physics and interaction. ‚Ä¢ Experience action and adventure in an open star-system that's been hand-crafted for Quest. ‚Ä¢ Choose your own path on foot and in your ship - or someone else's if you're into the grand-theft thing. ‚Ä¢ Fly your way, using thumb-sticks and/or virtual controls, along with other custom settings. ‚Ä¢ Earn credits through holo-apps for making deliveries and bounty hunting (More apps/jobs coming in updates!) ‚Ä¢ Spend those hard-earned credits at FlyAway! ‚Ä¢ Discover intriguing structures and artifacts as you learn about the technologies of unknown origin in this system. ‚Ä¢ Tormenting the police robots is dangerous fun. They'll just make more. ‚Ä¢ Or maybe you'd rather take a walk on the beach, and listen to some music? (EARLY ACCESS: This game is still in development and will receive frequent updates.

You will find the road map on the web site therefore you must try to image what this game could become! The basis of the game are rock solid! It's an open world where you literally travel with your spaceship from one planet to another....and then explore. You can make money transporting goods or hunting people...but watch out to the police! Therefore the way to develop the game are pretty much infinite. The developer is really friendly and open to any suggestion. Just give him time..there are a lot of ideas for the future..imho this game will become amazing..Also updates are quite frequent. For the current price...I think it's really an investment...if you like open word games.,"This is a game you can tell is gonna be HUGE if and when it‚Äôs fully completed. I can honestly say it might be the #1 game on the entire store once it‚Äôs complete. So far, there‚Äôs an incredible foundation to build from. There‚Äôs 5 planets (maybe 6?) and you can literally fly into orbit from the ground of 1 planet, traverse space, and land on another planet. The flight controls are pretty dang intuitive in my opinion. Yes, right now the game is a bit bare bones, but it‚Äôs constantly being updated with new features and mission types. This is the first game I‚Äôm asking strangers to hell support because I so badly want to see this dream completed. Keep it up! UPDATE: JUNE 23, 2023 I‚Äôm beginning to feel pretty duped. I was real excited about the progress this game was making and then suddenly NOTHING, NADA, NO UPDATES FOR 4+ MONTHS AND COUNTING. Come on, not even a tiny little update to let us know you‚Äôre still working on it? Too bad. This could have been real special. DO NOT BUY UPDATE: JUNE 24 2023 I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening on my end, but I haven‚Äôt gotten an update notification for months now. You are 100% correct though, I apologize. You‚Äôve been updating every month after looking at your website. My 23rd Update was outta line and unfair. I knew you were a single dev which is why I THOUGHT I gave you 5 months before commenting lol. I‚Äôm gonna have to check my headset settings to see why I haven‚Äôt been getting the updates. Sorry again. Keep up the great work. I‚Äôll delete the update if you like, but I wanted it known: I WAS WRONG. IM SORRY. BUY THIS GAME TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE. YOU WONT BE SORRY. If there‚Äôs anything else I can do to make up for the mistake, please let me know.",Spent a good amount of hours messing around in this game. It‚Äôs amazing that such a huge open world can run on quest. The game is in early access so keep that in mind before you buy. I‚Äôm excited to see how this game improves in the future,"A great game with a huge amount of potential, really enjoying how the game feels and how it runs, however I have a few suggestions and complaints A problem that I encountered was that when I saw the save option I thought there would be slave slots where I could go back and play a older save and not worry about experimenting with somethings, so when I decided to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù get a 110330000 bounty I thought I could just go back to a old save where I didn‚Äôt have such bounty, I was wrong and was forced to delete that save which I had spent more than 3 hours which saddened me I would appreciate it if you added a previous save feature so I don‚Äôt run into this sort of issue again and I would also like to see more ambient sound, more clothes, weapons and vehicle customisation, more types of option to remove bounties, ways to steal from npcs without being noticed, maybe some hand weapons like plasma swords and stuff, maybe some completely underwater planets (almost like subnautica) Although I understand you guys already have a lot on your plate but these were just a few suggestions for when you guys are free and have fully fleshed out the game Really awesome game and at first I was skeptical but now I‚Äôm completely Invested in this games success, please whoever reads this review Buy the game!!!!!! Update - Just found another bug This bug stopped me from owning 2 vehicles, I bought 2 vehicles, saved the game then quit, however when I returned to my save I found I only had the latest vehicle I bought and so I wasted 18000 credits, please fix this But even with these minuscule bugs this game is a masterpiece and it‚Äôs one of the only games I keep coming back to, great job devs ü´°ü´°","Even with it's very unfinished look and feel, this game has brought me a higher level of immersion than 90% of the VR games I've played out there. I feel it is mainly because this game was developed with excellent fundamentals from the interactions, to the worlds that truly feel alive and busy with life (even with 0 voicelines!) I've only spent a couple hours playing so far, but every time I took my headset off it felt like waking up from a different life. Though not exactly comparable, the last time a VR game made me feel like this was Skyrim VR."
