Thank you, SimLab Soft VR, for providing such excellent service!","Best is class sketchup to VR app! In the quick list below I’ll try to summarize in the “pros” things that SimLabVR does better than SentioVR and in the list of “cons” things that SentioVR does better. Pros: Simple to use and effective material selection, which makes a huge difference in the final looks of the rendering. Render looks even better in PC VR mode. Sun, sky, and environment settings. Grab and move objects around! This one is awesome! Personalize the user’s virtual hands to any 3D model of your choice. Download and test objects like furniture and trees directly into the VR scene. X-ray view teleportation mode looks cool. Upload up to 3 models to your free account for Oculus standalone experience (no need for a VR ready PC) with no time limit or finite demo period. Cons: Texture render is sometimes buggy, with several inverted faces and missing textures (as compared to what you see in SketchUp). This is probably the biggest flaw of this app right now. Mis-inverted faces can cause “false floors”, where the user falls into infinity. Very uncomfortable. Free flight mode can`t go thru walls and floors and other objects in VR. Right hand teleport range is too short. It should be possible to jump to distant objects in the VR scene. It should automatically convert the SketchUp Scenes into VR Cameras, instead of requiring the user to create new ones in SimLabVR Studio. No easy way to change the user’s height while in VR. I really hope the devs address the cons at some point.","very cool app but not what it should be. from the viewer you could create a virtual environment, a room, a house, an outdoor place with trees and rocks. ability to build something with blocks that you can enlarge and change shape. a bit like the room demo, you have to be able to add objects as you like and then save the project and see it later, walking through it, and you should also be able to grab objects. and instead you have to do it from a computer and it's all very cumbersome and complex. instead from the viewer you can do it","This app is easy to use and integrates well with SketchUp. I am currently in the process of designing a new home. I have used SketchUP and this app to preview my design before ever hammering a nail. SketchUp colors are a little off, you need to play with the materials in the VR SimLab app to get them right. Overall, fantastic app. Really enjoying it.",i can't login on oculus quest 2 that show connection failed. How can I do?
