The only thing I didn't like was that it was very short. It would be cool if there was some type of just exploration mode where you could swim around a beach or something. Very good though.,This game is so fun and worth the money. I just wish it didn’t end on a cliffhanger.,"I like this game a lot because of the fact that you swim the whole time! I know no other swimming games on vr, and I don't think any of them are as cool as this one. I would ask the developer only one thing: I would really like it if I could skip the first part of the game. The action and adventure doesn't really start until after you get the two keys and discover the magical creature. I found this part of the game not very exciting and whenever I want to replay this game I have to go through this long part again and I just wish there was something like a chapter select so I could skip it and go straight to the part where the ship is sinking. But I still enjoy this game and I love the intensity of running out of breath and searching for oxygen. This is a fun game whenever I feel like swimming but don't want to go to the pool.",I bought this game yesterday and finished the day after...far too short and so not worth the money. I was enjoying it . But time limit very disappointing.,It's OK but it ended to quickly
