The only thing that would make this game 10 times better would be if they added multiplayer to have a friend play with you because it can be boring and lonely sometimes being a god all by yourself.",I love this game so much but it get boring but I have a idea how about the astronaut update so you know the moon that’s there in the sky they didn’t really do anything with it except for a achievement so what I think what they should do is when you reach the modern era you get a new miracle called the astronaut you throw it down and it spawns a astronaut but you need a rocket for a astronaut so you’ll have to spawn a scientist so they can built a rocket and when they built that rocket the astronaut gets in and goes to the moon and makes a new civilization and the more civilizations making in space there’s gonna be conflict and even if a group of people rebel against there civilization and then steal the rocket and have them have a 50/50 chance to make it and maybe make more planets and different civilizations have space battles obviously you don’t have to this but I think it would be a good idea,"I originally saw someone play this game on YouTube like three or four years ago and then a few years after that, I figured out that it was on the quest two and I knew I just had to buy the second that I bought the game I was like wow OK this game is perfect and I absolutely love it. I took a break from it for a few years then I came back to the game is actually realize how much fun this game is I just wish that you could find rooms to see other peoples islands that they have built that would be really fun to do especially to see what other people have made up in their mind to try to make their own world That’s the only thing this game really needs now.","After getting the final era it’s kinda gets boring please add more eras and more biomes and resources, second the sandbox mode don’t feel sandbox you still have the limit which stops me from making things I want so please increase the limit of tiles for sandbox by a lot please! I haven’t played in weeks I want too but there’s been no updates that really interested me. I know your a small group of developers but I hope you make a update that fixes the problems that I feel. Hope you can make your game better… I read your response devs I understand that it’s a technical issue when you release the next update I will play it so I’m going to stay tuned"
