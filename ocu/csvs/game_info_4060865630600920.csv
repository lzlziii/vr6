But the bikini girl is well made, which I think is what this game is really about. So I give it a three star. I hope the developer keep refining this game and adding more contents, cuz I think we need more bikini girl games in VR.",It’s good but all you can do is play volleyball and it gets a little boring after little but the volleyball mechanics are great,"It’s not a good game, I almost broke my controller,and my headset",bake her booty jiggle and when u touch her make her react and so u can interact with her bc we all know boys when she came runnin at u we all tried to touch them and let u grip so u make a fist when u hit the ball and so u can grip the babooshkas and then a crowd of other girls jumpin up and down in the crowd,"when she's pick the ball, the ball just start flying"
