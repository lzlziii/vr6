Pub Darts,"Step up to the Oche with Pub Darts. A detailed simulation of the game of darts that immerses you in the familiar environment of the Pub. From the crackling fireplace to the hustle and bustle of the nearby bar you'll find yourself transported to your favorite local as you enjoy a few games of darts. Practice alone or invite a friend to join you for a match. The dartboard and oche are precisely calibrated to BDO professional standards, and the automatically updating scoreboards will keep you well informed as to how your game is progressing. Supports both Left and Right handed playing, just grab the darts with the hand you do not intend to throw with, then take a dart into your other hand and throw. Games are played from 501.",3+,"Multiplayer, Single User",Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Simulation, Sports",English,1.1,Ardooly,Ardooly,http://www.ardooly.com/,"Apr 23, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3621834484590501/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3621834484590501&r=1, http://www.ardooly.com/privacy",166.6 MB,"Cant play with a friend even if we write the same room name and if we leave the room the game freeze ,i reach out to the developpers but still nothing","Found the throwing mechanism easy to ‘pick up’ and use, and as a relative novice, it seems pretty accurate. Couple of suggestions from my short time playing: 1) as already said, the ability to play a random person would be good (I don’t have any friends on Quest) 2) the ability to raise the board height: when you’re stood right in front of it, it could be higher (on a real board, I believe the bullseye is about 5 feet 8” high (which is a couple of inches taller than me). It would make the game more accurate 3) similarly, whilst there is a floor marker, perhaps the equivalent of the standard throwing distance as an auto setting (7 feet 9 and a quarter inches is the most used distance I believe) 4) I liked the room but found it slightly disconcerting to still hear voices when it’s empty! Perhaps different venues, such as playing in front of an actual crowd? 5) I have only played a short while, so it may already be part of the game, but rebounds if a dart hits the wire would add to the realism. Sorry for being picky, a really good start but some improvements would make it top notch.","Game is ok and feeling of dart game is accurate. Missing three things it's for hot sitt competition @ friends meeting in real. 1 - counter of average 2 - counter of turns to clear 501 3 - scoreboard for local multiplayer. Description: at beginning of game each player type a names on grenboard for 2+ players and each player try to clear 501, after clean, on greenboard results will be shown in 2 numbers average and number of turns, and next player can try to beat the score. Highest Score can be saved :) name and date of achieve. So in result you will have universal game for single player, multiplayer local and multiplayer over net.","It was difficult to figure out how to throw the darts and hit the target at first, but after practice it got much easier. I'd like to see more dart games added along with 501. I'd also like to see other dart fins to choose from. Possibly other locations to play in. It would be cool to have famous backgrounds. Cheers TV show, the Winchester from Shawn of the dead, or other famous pubs & bars.","Before reading the previous review I was going to suggest adding more games (i.e. cricket, baseball, etc.) A cool feature might be having the ability to customize the dart flights and maybe be able to play against other people you don't know. Besides the above suggestions, I think it's a great game and the developers have a good thing going with the endless possibilities. Congratulations on a good game."
