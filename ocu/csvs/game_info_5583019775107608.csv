Nicely detailed animals and seeing a full sized dino in you living room is quite amazing. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is user interface. It needs some serious work. For starters it's too big. It should be much smaller and placed infront of the user. The whole menu aesthetic design should get some love as well. I'd also say, when you start up the app, there should be only menu, no animals yet. Other than that, great experience!","So fun!!! The hand tracking mode (set down controllers and your hands are shown live in the game, I had to enable hand tracking in my headset settings) was incredible it was like I was in the game with the very detailed animals! I highly recommend this to anyone with a QuestPro. It really looks like the animals are in your house â€¦ elephants, tigers, rhinos, farm animals, and a ton more! It was easy to move animals around both using controllers or with hand tracking","Explore different animals as they share space with your surroundings using passthrough. I am using the Quest Pro, so the color view of your room, with the generous cluster of animals hanging around is convincing. You can pick various options like spawn a random one at a time, or let the program distribute the entire cast, all spread out in your room scale setup. Other options let you see them all table top sized, where they almost could be playing pieces, or have them life size, which is crazy. I have mine traced for two rooms, so I was startled for a moment when I turned the corner and a life-size crocodile was at my feet. Even worse, my miniature Pinscher was lying on the floor, but a huge bear was covering it up. When my dog got up, I jumped for a moment, thinking one of these creatures is roaming! The UI is simplistic and can use a little polish, and there's no option (so far?) to rescale animals manually, but the animals are incredibely detailed. You can grab them by hand (or controller), and place them where you'd like, however, the very large animals have a box under their belly to make them easier to grab. The boxes would be better off transparent. Overall, some fun exploring here. All critters have their own stand-in-place animation. That's right tarantula, stay there! With upgrades, this can easily be a good educational tool for the kids.","Note: I received a free key for the app given away by the developer. I think it's a good app to really appreciate the size scale of different animals in person without having to go to an actual zoo (plus you can't necessarily get that close to them at a real zoo). There's also a table if you turn around in the lobby that you can play with. Reminded me of playing with toys as a kid, and I think overall this might be a good educational app for very young children (assuming it's actually okay for them to use headsets at those ages). There was also some pinch draw function related to the table but I wasn't sure what that was for. Something I did notice is that while in the lobby, eventually the audio starts counting down from 10. I then decided to time it and it looks like it ends and then restarts the scene at 100 total seconds. I'm assuming this is related to an asset being used in the app. This seems specific to the lobby, as in one of the other scenes I was able to got 2-3 minutes without the same behavior. But it did mean I couldn't actually play with the table.","Lions, elephants and a T-Rex! In real size. If you like animals, this is a must for you. AR immersion is incredibly. Waiting for the final AAA version :) I really appreciate."
