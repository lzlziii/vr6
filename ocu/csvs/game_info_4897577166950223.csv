Ancient Dungeon Beta,"Grab your gear and delve into this rogue-lite dungeon crawler! The Ancient Dungeon is known throughout the land; a place of malice and danger to all but a few brave souls. These men and women - adventurers, explorers, even scholars - enter the dungeon in pursuit of legendary fortunes and objects of immense power, all believing themselves more capable than those who have gone before...but few return. You would follow them? So be it, but take care: the dungeon will twist and shift behind as you pass, confounding any escape. To survive, you must find a way through, for there is no way back. Explore a vast dungeon of ever-changing paths! Swing swords, throw knives, and shoot arrows as if you held the weapons yourself! Uncover the lost history of the dungeon! Climb over deep pits, dodge lethal traps, and search for hidden treasures! Smash pots. Break crates. Itâ€™s just good fun.!",16+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Adventure, Fighting",English,b0.9.1,ErThu,ErThu,http://erthu.de/,"Jan 15, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4897577166950223/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4897577166950223&r=1, http://erthu.de/pp_advr.html",381.6 MB,"Itâ€™s so much fun, I am definitely going to buy the full version. One time I did like 55 damage with my sword, and my knifeâ€¦ well, to be honest I donâ€™t remember. Also you can get this one before buying the full game so you can get a taste for it. So altogether itâ€™s a great game, and you should definitely get this, and you might like it, you may not, but at least itâ€™s free. ðŸ™‚","Itâ€™s pretty much the same as the one you have to pay for, so before you buy it, play through this entire game to see if you wanna get the full game. Itâ€™s basically a horror game, Iâ€™ve been jump scared a few times in this game.","Great app! Lots of fun, and very long. There are so many different creatures to find! It is great that there is a free version and even though it is beta I have encountered no problems. The beta version does not come with all the content but there is still so much on here! Quick edit: please make more weapons! even a simple bow would be amazing. You only have two weapons and that is kind of lame.",It's basically Minecraft Dungeons in VR but better because Minecraft Dungeons sucks. This is one of the best VR games I've played by far.,"I love this game it's like Minecraft but the monster, part I'm not that far in the game but it's so much fun! I it's not really scary, as a ten year old my opinion should have more blood."
