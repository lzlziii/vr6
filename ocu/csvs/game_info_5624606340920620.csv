I'm not sure how scoring works or why some rocks fell and others grew. I never beat the giant. A tutorial is definitely needed.,"The only thing you do in this game is shoot balls at a giant old lady. I’m not joking. And she will witewy hit da gwitty if she kills Karga. It’s so stupid, it’s funny. You’ll have a bit of entertainment for a minute or two, then it’s over. I don’t really recommend this game.","Really enjoyed this promising shooter game...the settings with the animals on looking is awesome. ..looking forward to playing more , it's a real comfortable play.","Looking good so far I like the 3d models, let's get some movement in combat and some faster shooting maybe? Can't wait for an update happy to be here the whole process"
