And I haven't even needed to enable the flat screen (anti-motion-sickness) option. The learning curve is definitely a bit steeper than some of the other fitness titles, but redoing the tutorial a few times I think I now got the idea. Some things are still not perfectly clear, whether I have to squat for the gates or not, or how the half squat affects the speed / controllability. As for sport value, it is pretty good workout, though not at the level of dedicated fitness games, but for a game this is pretty good. Maybe at higher levels it could become more demanding. At this point, it needs more of my concentration than my stamina or energy. I will keep an eye on this project, and might even consider to add to my VR fitness arsenal, as it surely provides always needed variety!",Love the idea for using rubber band. Could be very entertaining but gives me terrible motion sickness. Would be great if game provided an option for motion sensitive people. Always looking to increase variety in my exercises.,"Interesting controls and interesting way to get us to do squats (with resistance bands). I'd be interested in buying this if there was a way to disable motion of the environment, though. That's because my partner gets motion sickness if the environment moves on its own. I know this would be weird though: you'd be on a vehicle that doesn't move, but obstacles rush towards you. But hey, my partner really wants to work out with resistance bands.","A sports game with a new way of interaction. A fun, dynamic, and fast experience."
