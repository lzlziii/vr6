Unlimited Playspace VR Minigames,"Minigames for massive play-space sizes, one of the first series of minigames that allows you to play with up to football field size levels where you have to be agile and on your feet, dodging enemies, jumping across gaps, crawling through small spaces, and making it past deadly traps. Extra Large Playspace VR Minigames introduces a new VR mechanic for height based jump detection which is used for when you jump over gaps. Standing mode is available for the minigames if you can't find a place to place either indoors or outdoors. Please read the safety guide for set up and tips to help avoid damaging your headset. This game is still very experimental and the Quest 2 is not meant to be played outside and played beyond its normal boundaries. Avoid any direct sunlight and only play when the sun is not visible. Cloudy days can work, but not all the time. Best time to play is at either dawn or dusk. The lighting conditions must be perfect in order for the game to track.",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Arcade, Simulation",English,0.6,Virtual Go LLC,Virtual Go LLC,http://virtualgo.mypreview.site/,"Feb 23, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4241533002597304/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4241533002597304&r=1, https://www.virtualgoreality.com/information.html",761.7 MB,"My initial review stated ""looks like i have to click on forward or back boxes/ but nothing happens. Help."" Well I finally figured it out... you select box by pointing to and highlighting the box and pushing the A controller button. It would be good if those instructions were readily available. Otherwise app does exactly what it's supposed to.",The next stage of MR. Great use of Oculus Head set. Actually a great fun way to work out. I felt like I got a work out in with 30 min of play outside. Does have to be cloudy for it to work the best.,Play on a cloudy day and it is a lot of fun. Do not play when it is too bright or dark. Major workout
