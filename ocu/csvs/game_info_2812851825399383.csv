But TOKYO CHRONOS is no comparison. At first, you're surprised at the beautiful images. But the deep story surpasses it"".",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Interactive Story","English, Chinese (China), German, Japanese",1.0.4,MyDearest Inc.,MyDearest Inc.,https://tokyochronos.com/en/,"Jun 19, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2812851825399383/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2812851825399383&r=1, https://tokyochronos.com/en/privacypolicy/",Terms of Service,747.2 MB,"personally, i am a total sucker for a good story. i will totally lose enormous amounts of sleep to read or watch something for the first or fifth time. that being said, i did get multiple headaches trying to do this with a vr. if you do this as well, make sure to take breaks! after the first play through i thought it was fun to watch the dialogue change with the character development, and i haven't completely finished it or even gotten close, but i already love this game so much. totally recommend!",Having lived 8 years in Asia I understandably became a fan of Manga. Tokyo Chronos has a very compelling story and leaves you with the desire to “turn to the next page”. You can really bridge the boundary of reality and fantasy with this one.,"This can't be called a game or novel. You spend the entire time just reading so you can make a few choices. Then you complete the ""game"", but to unlock everything you just keep going back over the same boring story. I fell asleep multiple times trying to do this.","I didn't know what to expect going in, but it turned out to be a VR Visual Novel about friendship and how our bonds link us, as well as what happens when you fail to communicate and be there for each other. You see through the eyes of the main protagonist as you try to figure out whodunit and what happened with your closest friends. The characters are vibrant and alive and pull you in right away. It leaves you sucked in till the very end. My only complaint is a technical one, and that is during a flashback with Machikoji the translation gets VERY broken and almost unintelligible. But it's only one very small part (why I still gave it 5 stars) . The rest is fine.","After going through a roller coaster of emotions between happy, sad, upset, confused and love I finally got to see what a beautiful masterpiece this game was. I recommend it to everyone to try, the negative reviews are people that can't see past graphics or are lazy to get to the true ending or want interaction, although I respect their opinions. VR is still developing and growing so it's not perfect but this game really made me feel like part of a world and a story where I felt connected with each character, so if you can see past all negativity and see where this game truly shines then you won't be dissapointed! I really loved the true last ending of the game and made my heart feel whole and accomplished after expecting the worse. Made me feel like a hero for getting to the true end and saving everyone including myself! I thank the developers for creating such a beautiful novel and I look forward to more of such beautiful master pieces like this one!"
