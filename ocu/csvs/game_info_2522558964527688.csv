Review: OhShape is an extraordinary VR game that immediately captivated me with its unique rhythm workout and exhilarating music. As an avid VR player and fitness enthusiast, OhShape completely won me over with its creative challenges and engaging atmosphere. The gameplay of OhShape is simply brilliant. You move to captivating music while simultaneously dodging obstacles that come towards you in rhythm. The combination of rhythm and dexterity makes the game an exhilarating workout that provides both challenge and entertainment. The variety of music and choreographies in OhShape is impressive. From energetic pop hits to soothing melodies, the game offers a wide range of songs that cater to every musical taste. The carefully crafted choreographies perfectly match the music, creating a harmonious gaming experience. The graphics and design of OhShape are aesthetically appealing. The stylized environment and colorful obstacles create a vibrant game world that continues to delight. The intuitive control with the VR controllers allows you to fully focus on the movements and rhythm. Another plus of OhShape is its customizable difficulty. You can tailor the game to your own abilities and preferences, making the gaming experience accessible and challenging at the same time. This allows for personal growth and increases the motivation to improve constantly. OhShape is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a captivating and motivating rhythm workout. With its unique gameplay mechanics, variety of music and choreographies, and customizable difficulty, OhShape completely impressed me. If you're searching for a brilliant VR game that gets you dancing and moving, then OhShape is the perfect choice!","OhShape is the perfect game for me, I'm 25 and this is the perfect exercise level for me! But these last few updates are only damaging the game. The new crappy song pictures and the way the songs are organized now need to go. The game was perfect when I first got it! Please see this, you are only making your game look bad with the very poor google pictures! Your game looks so cheap now, and I know it isnt. I love this game! PS. New songs will always ALWAYS be a benefit, I WILL pay for DLC!! Just add them!","Love it great workout, can‚Äôt understand people complaining it‚Äôs brilliant I‚Äôm 60 years young and I‚Äôm on hard difficulty now, expert is going to be a definite challenge but I will get there, love the way this game makes you move and move you will","This game is better than I had expected. The review that says it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a workout‚Äù is not accurate, and is that person‚Äôs experience. Not mine, and not most people. I‚Äôm a Fitness Instructor at a Gym, and I teach High Intensity Hitt Classes all week long, and hour at a time. This game gets me sweating and having a lot of fun! Challenging myself to go to higher intensity levels. You can groove to the music‚Ä¶,,but only with a lot of time playing the game. (The girl in the trailer makes it look easy) it‚Äôs not easy. You have to get the hang of it. And then push yourself. Don‚Äôt give up if you only get 14% on a song. That just means you have a lot of room to improve. This game isn‚Äôt easy. Even for fit people. So take it from me. A person in the Fitness Industry. This game is fun. You have to give yourself a chance to get the hang of it. Then Push! Music is great. I am very happy with this purchase. That‚Äôs my opinion anyways.","I love the music, enjoy the stretches. It‚Äôs rare I want my DLC/Bundles though. I‚Äôd recommend buying."
