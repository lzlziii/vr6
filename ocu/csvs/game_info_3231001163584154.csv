However the primary reason I got the game was to play the horde mode with my friend, but neither of us can create a server, join a random server or really do anything outside of solo for horde mode. Really hope this gets fixed soon",Last night I tried playing with my friend and we couldn’t create a game or even join a random one and it couldn’t have been under service seeing as it was seven in the afternoon and it was still light outside. This game is beautiful and close to perfect but I would really like to play it with my friends who have been loyal fans of warhammer 40k and games workshop so please fix this or at least give me some feedback on what could have gone wrong,"Its a really good 40k game so far, it would be cool to see a game about guardsman though before a vr space marine game if you make anything 40k related again, also does co op work now? I heard it doesnt work and im wondering if it is working again so that my friend will buy it and play with me",If you're not 40k fan don't buy story short visuals are ok sound ok gameplay is basic so for non 40k fan is a no but for fan .... Its nice so overall it 3.5/5,"This is an amazing game, even more so if you’re a hardcore Warhammer 40,000 fan that wants an immersive experience. The graphics, atmosphere and storytelling shine as brightly as the Astronomicon. In the grim darkness of this far future there is only war, and now you have this game to find out just how bleak and terrible that universe is. This team should do a Space Marine game, a Space Hulk or Kill Team game in the same mold."
