Please keep those coming great work. thank you very much to the developers. Great job üòäüôè,"Unfortunately i didn't understand what the hell i was looking at, but it looks a great tutorial. Hopefully more will be added to this free app","4/5 game. I enjoyed the premise and thought it was well executed. Good interactability. The story mode was short but compelling. It‚Äôs also free, so definitely worth a download! That being said, I could only give it 4 stars for 3 main reasons. 1 - there‚Äôs not much replay value (maybe add a multiplayer mode?) 2 - it seemed kind of arbitrary if you had to press right or enter to move onto the next screen. I think more consistency would help new players a lot. 3 - the way the hands were shaded makes the bottoms darker at all times. This is a neat little shortcut to give realistic shading most of the time, but if you go palms up, it‚Äôs a bit immersion breaking."
