Hordz,"Battle for survival against the mysterious Hordz! Test your dexterity to your puny human limits, unleashing your twin lightning wands to defend against waves of unforgiving foes. Battle witches, goblins, vampires, skeleton bikers and other members of the ""fundead"". Can you perform intricate monster kill-moves under unrelenting pressure? Probably not, but you should give it a try anyway! FEATURES: - Fight using magic wands! - Get a workout wielding spiked maces in the new Melee mode! - Over 80 levels of VR horror action. - Perform simultaneous kills for higher scores. - Silly monster sound effects and pumping original tunez. This is an App Lab game, and as such is IN-DEVELOPMENT, so we have a ton of new features ready to be added, plus more in the pipeline. COMING SOON: - 360 mode with multiple fogs. - Projectile weapons. COMING LATER (HOPEFULLY - but not guaranteed): - Level editor. - Movement within levels.",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Fighting, Horror","English, Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Venezuela)",1.6.7,LanguageBug,LanguageBug,https://www.languagebug.com/,"Oct 22, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3916103038509228/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3916103038509228&r=1, https://www.languagebug.com/games/Common/Privacy/PrivacyPolicyMobileApp.htm",55.6 MB,It was so good,I like because I like Fighting game ï¿¼,"When it comes to a ""free"" game, I consider whether I feel like my time was well spent. In its current state, no, I don't feel like I'd play this over other VR wave defense shooters. Pros: + Aiming felt pretty dead-on. + Different monsters types did add some variety. + Menus and stages loaded quickly (other than tutorials, more on that later). + The overall vibe was cohesive. Cons: - Spamming triggers was too effective of an approach. Some sort of ""energy"" or reload system would go a long way to forcing a bit of strategy. - The tutorials kept bugging out. Got stuck in a loop where a tutorial played like 3 times before I could play the related level. - Map nodes need to be more spread out and ideally have less trees blocking the view. I had a hard time aiming at the specific things I wanted to click on. Adjusting the map tilt to be more top-down instead of quite as isometric could help as well. - Graphics are not great, but if the core gameplay was ironed out could give them a pass. Hope to see more from this developer down the road as there are glimmers of potential here!","Great fun to play. It gets more challenging every time, very addictive.","So, the game is good, fun to play with waves lasting just enough to give you that successfulness gratification, doesn't let you get bored of interminable and exhausting never ending waves or unachievable enemies, which is good and enemies get added progressively with different dynamics each one, I think is specially good for families or to show the potential of VR to friends. Is still in an early stage I believe but is fully playable, maybe as the ither comment said, the tutorial could be improved but it adds to the mix haha. Wondering how far this game will go."
