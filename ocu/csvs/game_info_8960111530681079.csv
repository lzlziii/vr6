Much simpler than those 2 other games but it’s not trying to compete… it’s a fun target shooter, plain and simple, with perfect gun mechanics and fun mini games. Seriously, this might be the BEST VALUE on the entire store at $7. Knowing what I know now I’d have predicted it’s be $19.99 or $14.99. $7 is an absolute STEAL. Please keep the updates coming! Also adding more firearms would be very welcome as well lol. If you were to release a DLC that offered 5-10 new guns, I’d gladly pay another $5-$7. Keep up the great work… if you ended up including 30-40 firearms into the game, plus mods & attachments to fool around with, “GUNS” would certainly rank in the top 10 or 20 offered in AppLab AND the Main Store. UPDATE JUNE 1, 2023: Just keeps getting better and better. Promises made and promises being kept. Love the addition of ak47 & the silenced pistol. Also loving how the scarecrows attack now! Pretty cool lol. Keep going man… this game could really turn into something special if it ends up with a whole slew of firearms. Only wish I have is for the ability to add ATTACHMENTS. Suppressors, scopes, sights, grenade launcher attachment for AK, etc…. And the ability to save your favorite builds. Otherwise, keep up the great work! P.S. The constant updates are much appreciated! Updates are rarely just simple bug fixes… usually there’s something of real substance added, which makes me really look forward to each update. P.S.S. Im pretty bummed this game hasn’t received the love or attention it deserves. This is better than 90% of games offered on the MAIN STORE, let alone AppLab. Not like the price is gonna break the bank. UPDATE JUNE 27, 2023 I really like where you’re headed. Being able to fully kit a weapon out to wazoo and also the ability to save favorites would be fantastic. Honestly, your doing everything I’ve already asked for and then some…. My biggest wish would probably be more rifles… combat rifles, like AK’s, not sniper. If the game were to get bigger, I’d really want co-op modes, or a pvp mode…. It’s a shame this doesn’t get the love. Do you have a discord channel? If so I’d love to discuss suggestions further. All I can say now is, THANK YOU FOR THE CONSTANT UPDATES, AND GOOD LUCK. You really deserve some love and recognition for this.","The graphics are simple, but I like how the rifles and shotguns feel with my VR gunstock. I enjoy trying to speed shoot with the bolt action, and testing the different guns."
