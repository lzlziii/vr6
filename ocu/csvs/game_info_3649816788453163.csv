It has 6 slots but nothing appears in them. Love the game but I can't proceed any farther in the game.,"This game for me is one of the best. It starts off on a little island. 1 tree. 1 rock. 1 hook. It tells you how to hook debris from the water. Then, your pretty much on your own. When you pick up or craft a new item you'll get a short 'how to use it'. You notice a small raft to one side. You finally jump on it. Hmmm? What to do next..? Turn around. Argh! The island have moved! Your now flouting away! You panic, jump in the water to get back.. MASSIVE SHARK! ARGH! Your back on the raft. I better start building and go somewhere.. Fish out debris out the water, use a machine to craft; Water machine, fireplace, walls, more floors, doors, upstairs! This things massive now! Let's craft an engine, steering, compass..weapons! Look there's and island ahead! And a tower! I can see sheep on the island. 6 hours later.. no I don't want to sleep, I need to craft some windows and a sink. Then I need to get my rod put and do some fishing. Shark!..no food now! It's truly an amazing place to escape to. Try it and your love it. By the way.. there's a creative mode! To just build. And a peaceful mode! ..so no sharks ;-) your welcome :-D",I love the game but there is a glitch where my boat parted like the red sea and it's very annoying but as I said great game would recommendüëçüëçüëç,I play on quest 2 and when I first played it worked but then when I tried the play the next day it just would never load.,"The game is heccin great and simple at first but gets more complex. But people gotta stop pestering about muliplayer, because they have a small team and multiplayer takes awhile to fix."
