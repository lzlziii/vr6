Evade VR,"Evade VR is a unique arcade game in which you have to take the battle in outer space. You will have to fight the bots, dodging their shots and meteor showers. In battle you will help, an extensive arsenal of weapons, abilities and bonuses, combine them and earn as many points as possible. Be on the move - use your play space to collect bonuses, dodge enemies' shots and meteorites. Use your abilities during combat - slow down time and the gravity shield in the fight against bots and the surge of meteor shower attacks. Use weapons - shoot down bots with laser blaster shots, destroy meteors with a laser sword or use grenades. MULTIPLAYER UPDATE: In the update, you and your friends will have to go through many new challenges, protect and repair the spaceship and escape from inevitable death in outer space.",7+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Roomscale, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Action, Arcade, Shooting",English,2.1,Cnodax,Cnodax,https://cnodax.com/,"Jul 28, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3974274762620725/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3974274762620725&r=1, https://cnodax.com/evade-vr-privacy-policy",322.0 MB,"Wow very beautiful game, one of the best in terms of atmosphere and graphics, especially liked the special effects when exploding a black hole grenade. The gameplay has a lot of cool mechanics, but it's hard to master at first, I would add a tutorial video to the menu. The game is as dynamic as possible and keeps you constantly moving, a little play tired as after a run. Found a bug with throwing a grenade, sometimes it flies farther than you throw. Definitely recommend trying to play!","I don't know who decides on the pricing on games but I feel completely ripped off after buying this. Alarm bells started ringing when it was installing. Only 79MB was being installed. Immediately I knew I'd made a mistake. For £10.99 you would expect something professional, slick and graphically pleasing. Here you have no tutorial, basic presentation, poor graphics and sound. There are no leaderboards, you are just presented with your score at the end and your best score. When the game started I had no idea of the controls, and kind of worked it out for myself. Gameplay isn't very exciting and when you finally get the lightsaber it's not sitting correctly in your hand, it's not how you'd hold a sword in real life, it just doesn't feel right. This makes me so angry when games with the quality like this charge ridiculous amounts of money when in fact it should be free!! Look at Shock Troops that was released this week. It's stunning, fantastically presented, great graphics and sound, and is very addictive. That cost £3 less than this game!!!!! Thank god there is a refund of option. Avoid avoid AVOID!!!!!","The game definitely allows you to immerse yourself in the space atmosphere! When you play for the first time, at first you stand and rest, and after a couple of minutes the real madness begins, a bunch of bots and tons of meteorites arrive, only swords and blasters save you, in general, the action is guaranteed) A very dynamic arcade game that makes you tired at the level of fitness games. The game has very beautiful special effects, visually looks exciting and pleasant. There are indeed some flaws with the introductory training, at first you don’t understand how to use all the mechanics of the game, but after playing a little it becomes clear.","A very dynamic arcade game with beautiful special effects and interesting gameplay, you definitely feel immersed in the space atmosphere. Great for fitness, after playing 10 minutes I really get tired :(. As I lack more complete training on the game, but after playing a little, you start to use all the features of the game. Another point, for a comfortable game, it is desirable to have a lot of free space."
