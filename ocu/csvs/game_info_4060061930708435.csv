My hand keeps getting stuck on the Back or Next buttons. Please test with beta testers,"This is becoming my favorite game on quest! Very immersive, fast and heart pumping! This game puts you in the center of the action, where you fight monsters to survive by using multiple weapons and also throwing all sorts of objects at them. My favorite part is the satisfying sound they make when they pop, a nice crunchy sound. I also love how this game uses great combat physics with all sorts of items like logs, stones and even coconuts. Super fun to play!",Delightful surprise. Recommended !
