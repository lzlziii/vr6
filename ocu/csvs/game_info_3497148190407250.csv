Simple Theremin,"Simple Theremin is a musical instrument simulation that allows musicians to play a virtual Theremin using hand tracking as well as their touch controllers. With a variety of four different waveforms to choose from and reverb adjustment, you can create your own sound! Simple Theremin also lets you enable ""live mode"" and connect your quest headphone output into an amplifier for live performances.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Educational, Music, Utility",English,2.1.5,Maku,Maku XR,https://www.makuxr.com/simple-theremin,"Mar 12, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3497148190407250/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3497148190407250&r=1, https://www.makuxr.com/thereminprivacypolicy",213.6 MB,"Funny to test, but to limited. Could be cool to have a minimalist beatbox, for example.... OK to try 5mn, but no more i think.",This app is just beautiful in simplicity. It's a theremin. You just wave your hands around it to create music. It's just that simple. There's not a fancy background or complicated tutorial--it's just a simple theremin standing in a non-descript space inviting you to play. It's a great concept for a VR title and it is executed perfectly.,"I'm not sure what I can say about this, except that I expected a theremin and got a theremin. It would be nice to have actual hands to be able to play, so you could make finger adjustments, but it's still early in its development. Good work so far!",IT'S REALLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR VR. WHO KNOWS IT WAS INVENTED IN 100 YEARS AGO? Big thanks to you. It's very good Theremin experience. My dream comes true now! Now I can become Jimmy Page : ) . Would it be possible to add more circuit like overdrive/ distortion/ and Delay in the future?,Poo
