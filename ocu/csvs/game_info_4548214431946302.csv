Hello Neighbor: Search and Rescue,"Hello Neighbor: Search and Rescue is a groundbreaking VR horror-puzzle game where you sneak into your creepy neighbor's house to save your friend. - Multiple playable characters: Switch between characters to outsmart the Neighbor. Each unique character has their own key items and skills.

Many puzzles that may seem unsolvable at first glance require you to use the perspectives of multiple characters in conjunction to overcome them. - Non-linear exploration: Use your own approach to infiltrate Mr. Petersonâ€™s house by alternating perspectives, combining characterâ€™s skills to dynamically solve puzzles, uncover hidden mysteries, and reveal new pathways through your environment. - Confront your fears: Experience surreal and haunting revelations as the Rescue Squad learns more about the secrets of the Hello Neighbor universe!",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Horror, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Spain)",1.110705.1019,Steel Wool Studios,tinyBuild,https://www.helloneighborvr.com/,"May 25, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4548214431946302/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4548214431946302&r=1, https://www.tinybuild.com/privacy-policy",1.63 GB,"Don't step into my house Because you can just tiptoe quiet as a mouse Don't fool around Hello! I'm your neighbor Goodbye, I'll see you later This place was not for you to look and see Take it from me hello! You're in danger Good riddance to your behavior You may think I'm the devil And I wish your lives in peril Let me spell this out for you I'm just your neighbor now get out!","Update: no longer has any glitches so far, and itâ€™s super fun! Ignore everything else in the old comment, it is all fixed. I love the way the developers responded to my old comment. Thank you! Old:Great idea, but you canâ€™t really progress because of all of the glitches. Want to walk more than ten feet without flying into space? Not this game. I would recommend to wait for it to be fixed before you buy it.","I have never, ever had an app work so badly in Quest 2. I waited to buy this until I saw new reviews saying the bugs were gone and I have to assume those were fake because Iâ€™m watching walk through a on YouTube of the girl guiding you through the sewer and she never actually appears and I had to start all over! I am making a point to note this developer and never purchasing them forever. Ignore any reviews saying the bugs are fixed. They arenâ€™t!",I get the blue key to the door to the hallway to where the neighbor is sleeping on a pile of mattresses and when I go into the door the game puts me back into the closet and the lock and the key reset back to where I found them and it keeps happening and itâ€™s really annoying. I like the game a lot but this bug is something I donâ€™t like. I think it only happens when I get the blue key last but I still donâ€™t know why it happens. Has this happened to you before,"So many fun elements in this game. Kudos for creativity. Itâ€™s tough to talk about because I donâ€™t want to spoil anything. Itâ€™s like a fun adventure movie may watch as a kid and wish you could live it. A bit far fetched to call it a horror game. Itâ€™s sometimes starling when you get caught so I jumped and screamed a few times. ðŸ˜†I found it challenging as well mostly from remembering what door led where and figuring out how to move an object to get it where it needed to be. There were some glitches: getting stuck between objects or floors, falling through map, not being able to hoist myself up onto a surface. I was still able to complete the game, had a lot of fun and am so glad I got it. Hope thereâ€™s more to come!"
