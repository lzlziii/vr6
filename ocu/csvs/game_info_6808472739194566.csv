Environments can be better, you get a little bit tired of seeing just polygons. But it’s definitely got the biggest arcade feel I’ve ever played in over 80+ games I own. And for some reason it kept drawing me back in at the time, playing while I was waiting for a game to update, install, or if I had nothing to do. I’d just play 1-2 matches of this. Also the music is straight fire, but needs more “remixes” for different maps. Just try the game overall, it’s free. And you can just uninstall it later.","The game is good but just make some changes like adding swat based on how many cops you kill maybe add civilians to where if you shoot them you lose and maybe add cops taking cover and shooting at you or add more equipment like equipable rifles,shotguns or SMGs or more pistols it doesn’t matter just with •swat enemies •officers taking cover and shooting at you •different guns •and civilian NPCs’ It would be much much better",It’s not really worth your time compared to other FREE vr games like Pavlov or battle talent. Don’t expect too much from it.,Weird,so many police
