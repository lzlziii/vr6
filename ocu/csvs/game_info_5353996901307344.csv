I liked different environments and the background piano sound. Player number is not that high, but that is not this app's fault. I will probably be playing this game a lot in coming days. One thing I wish developers include that I can select more than one environments instead of ""any"". Like I do not want to play with the fantasy setting, but I like other three environment. An option to select multiple environment will be great! :)","Requires internet connection, please let me play offline. Would be great to have on a trip but the internet connection limits it. I hate having to turn on automatically clicking the clock when I'm done, would be nice if the game remembered my choice. I hate having to choose ai difficulties and time every time I play a game, wish it remembered these choices. Some teaching modes would be great.",Tldr don't buy this app. The app continuously crashes upon booting up or when it tries to make a move. I don't often have time to play. VR and I can't get a refund for this anymore due to the fact that it's been more than 14 days. This app showed a lot of promise but it fell flat on its face.,"Good surrounds, a good choice of boards, can play computer or real players"
