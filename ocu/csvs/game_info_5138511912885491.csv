Itâ€™s hard, although it most likely wonâ€™t make you rage or get upset, but it rather creates a fun challenge. I have to admit, it is quite the experience. I love how everything is made of little voxels and squares, itâ€™s like being inside of a retro video game! Also, I gotta say it, like Minecraft, lol. Yes, I know Minecraft isnâ€™t the birth of voxel and pixel games, just everyone relates it to that lol. Anywaaaaays, this game is great, and I totally recommend if you enjoy battle and fighting. Very satisfying, and to me the darkness of the dungeon was a little nerve-racking, heh.. ðŸ˜…","Ancient dungeon is an amazing game that I have hours of game play on, but today, when I loaded back on to the game I was met to the intro of the game where you start your newest run. The day before that, I saved my progress on the 5th layer. I was so furious that I nearly broke my headset. If anyone knows how to fix this, please tell me. I swear if I have to redo months of game play, I will rip out my hair.",Gameplay is absolutely perfect. I think I've sunk more hours in to this game than any other quest game and yet I still haven't unlocked everything! I can't stop coming back to it. I wish all rogue-like could be this well thought out. I hope they make a sequel or some dlc.,"Hey Ancient Dungeon! For the past while, Iâ€™ve been playing the game and I believe Iâ€™ve experienced everything there is to it. Iâ€™ve been here through beta, and have seen almost all updates the game has to offer. I came here to express my gratitude for the effort you guys put into this game. Through all my scares, (specifically purple slimes, and those yellow one too.) Iâ€™ve never stopped playing. I wanted to thank you guys for all your hard work. Also, here is a list of things to improve, and some glitches Iâ€™ve encountered. Improvements: I always felt as though the 1st boss(es) weâ€™re too easy Mimics donâ€™t blend in, and were never really a surprise Unless intentional, I never see gold slimes. Like every 5 runs one shows up. Mk Increase rate of finding the vine rooms. Like, that one big evil vine monster. You know what I mean lol. Glitches: I constantly encounter a glitch were my character just falls through the floor. I have lost a few runs to the glitch and itâ€™s annoying to say the least. What I want added (for fun section): New classes: Staff and ??? Bow and ??? Dagger and Medkit (For when multiplayer releases) Puzzle rooms MORE ZOMBIE VARIANTS Spiders Instead of the beasts cradle being a boss dedicated level, Iâ€™d like to see it with its own map and unique mobs. ALL IDEAS STATED FOR FUN End.",i love this game so much but there is no new updated and i would love multiplayer so i can play with my friends. this game is extremely underrated. good work guys foreal. so good. the graphics and random generated content is amazing. we need more of it!
