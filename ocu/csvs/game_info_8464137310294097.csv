VRFS,"VRFS is a community-driven football (soccer) simulator with a focus on realistic physics and competitive multiplayer. Here are the main features of VRFS: FOOTBALL PHYSICS SIMULATION: Players can perform almost any trick, from balancing the ball on the tip of their foot to executing curved power shots and long passes. The ball's trajectory is solely determined by the physics engine. COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer architecture allows for immediate response when a player touches the ball. For example, players can finish powerful crosses at the same speed as in real football COMFORT: Players can move around using thumbsticks and play in either a seated or standing position. No intense hand movements are required. NO PAY-TO-WIN in VRFS: Only skills matter. No one can buy 'stronger kicks' or 'faster boots.' Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement. FREE FOR ALL: Players have full access to the game without needing to purchase anything. However, if you wish, you can buy cool equipment in the store to support the further development of this project. Please keep in mind that VRFS is still in development, with upcoming upgrades to the physics and scenery. We'd appreciate your suggestions for any enhancements.",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Simulation, Sports",English,0.1,0BS3SS10N Co.,Immersification,https://vrfs.gg/,"Feb 3, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/8464137310294097/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=8464137310294097&r=1, https://vrfs.gg/en/docs/privacy/",Terms of Service,1.03 GB,"This is a great game and it’s my second favorite I just think that you guys should make a competitive so it it more fair for new players when they first get the game. Also can there be crouds in the game, and can the robots in practice look more like a human and no robot sounds? I love this game and keep up the good work!

I met people and they became some of my best friends and the updates just get better and better. Don’t listen to 3.5 stars or below, most of the people that don’t like this game is just beginners. The game physics are super fun to play with and the maps are just insane! -R0CK8 VR",It’s a top tier football game one of my favourite and personally the best but I feel they should add 1. Fans in the crowd to give a better atmosphere and make it more realistic 2. Make a ranked version to make it fun and competitive for the people who like competition also it could make the game more popular and you could meet a teammate and want to queue ranked with him/her But other than that great game keep up the great work,"My original review of this game was very mixed- mostly because of how unstable the game felt and how toxic the game was, and the lack of features to combat the community's toxicity. In the months since the game has massively improved by adding strict rules, adding in-game moderators (still a work in progress), and massively improved overall physics. I cannot recommend this game enough to soccer/football fans or just overall anybody, as long as you mute the people who constantly say slurs. However delays of updates and overall just long waits for the update have really brang out the community's true colors- spamming in discord servers, a couple negative reviews based entirely around said lack of updates- all i can say is the biggest problem with the game is the horrible community around it, and the game and its social medias really need some tweaking of who's moderating, because this really isn't it. Overall, 9/10 physics 10/10 developers Multiplayer depends on the server Stadiums 9.5/10 Community overall 2.5/10 Take care out there!"
