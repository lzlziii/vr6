There should be a setting to turn that off. There is a laser setting which I turn off, but it doesn't change anything in the app. Please put in a setting to shut off the bubbles that are shooting toward your face with each new firework as then I can give you the five stars this deserves.","A nice VR game.

I enjoyed it very much. It is simple, colorful and good effects to feel joyful and happy same time. If possible, Allow user to import 360 photos to use as background environment inside this VR game.
