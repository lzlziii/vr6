Create your own worlds and walk through them on PC Mobile or even VR! I love being so close to my creations and share these places with co-workers and friends! Highly recommend trying for all VR geeks out there!,"Unfortunately I didn't get to see what this experience is all about. It's not super clear from the description what it's about, but it was intriguing enough to download. You have to setup an account straight away, choose your language based on a flag (use the UK flag for English) and then the t's and c's popped up, but they were all redacted so impossible to read so I had to abandon at that point."
