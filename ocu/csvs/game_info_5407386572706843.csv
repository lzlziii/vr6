Noclip VR,"Noclip VR is a multiplayer game with unique locomotion and proximity chat!. The Game has many unique levels with different puzzles and entities. Invite your friends and noclip out of the frontrooms now! ""If you're not careful and noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.""",7+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Adventure, Horror",English,1.836,Reality Games Online,Reality Games ONline,https://realitygamesonline.net/Noclip/,"Oct 31, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5407386572706843/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5407386572706843&r=1, https://realitygamesonline.net/NoclippedVr/PrivacyPolicy.txt",1.65 GB,⬛️⬛️🟪🟪⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️ 🟨🟪🟪🟪🟪⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️ 🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️ 🟨⬜️🔳🟨⬜️🔳⬛️⬛️⬛️⬛️ 🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟫🟫⬛️⬛️⬛️ 🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨⬛️⬛️⬛️ ⬛️⬜️⬛️⬜️🟫🔲🔲🟦⬛️⬛️ ⬛️⬜️⬛️⬛️🟫🔲🔲🟦🟦⬛️ 🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟦🟦⬛️ 🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨⬛️🔲🔲⬛️ 🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨⬛️⬛️🟫🟫⬛️,"The game's great and all, but you should make all of the levels free. Don't get me wrong it's great, but all the levels should be free. Make the suits cost in game money and maybe four really awesome maps too! That way they can get it for free. Finally I would say when you beat the level, you should get coins like 50 coins. All in all I love this game, I would recommend playing the game!",Level 94 - Motion Level 9 - The suburbs Level 7 - Thalassphobia Level 6 - Lights out (Add flashlights) Level 11 - The Concrete jungle (Infinite city) Level 3999 - The true ending Level 5 - Terror hotel Level 39 - Megalophobia ALSO ADD SUB LEVELS! THAT WOULD MAKE A TRUE BACKROOMS EXPERIENCE! ( Still a great game though) Level 43 - Water world (THATS ALL! I HOPE YOU ADD SOME OR ALL OF THESE LEVELS IN FUTURE UPDATES! GREAT GAME TOO!!),Hi my name is Ryan and me and my friends were able to beat this game quickly even after the update and so my recommendation is that you add level 94 and the barrier level aka the exit to the backrooms I know that this is for reviews but I wanted to make my recommendation somewhere Edit It would be cool if you make the some rooms black and added smilers so that then you needed to find a flashlight,"So I get this game and like dawg, bumps were getting goosed!💀💀💀 If u want to get spooked for 🆓🆓🆓 then get this game.
