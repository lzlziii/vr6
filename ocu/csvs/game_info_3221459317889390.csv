If you don‚Äôt make Instagram filters, this isn‚Äôt for you! That being said it gets one star because I do lake Instagram filters and when I pushed my current filter to the headset just says to ‚Äúupdate spark vr player‚Äù ??? Its up to date!","The ingame phone ar tool just shows a graphical artifact. I feel like this was also the case on the PC version, but I don't remember.",This will be boring and useless apps if you don't try to make effect for Spark AR. I'm not pro in these apps but just a quick try creating simple effect on it by just using Surface Go 2 directly transfer to Oculus Quest. And it works flawless.. i can view the effect in different virtual environment without going out in open area with my phone. Well done FB,AR in VR? Why? Why not AR in real life through passthrough? What's the reason of AR in VR?,This seems like someones unfinished highschool project. How did this make it to applab and some many other titles on sidequest still missing from this spot. üòï
