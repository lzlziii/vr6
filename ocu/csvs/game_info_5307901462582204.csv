One of the best games made for it. I have had a problem with swapping my glove hand to my left hand. I have tried everything but nothing has worked. Please help!,Great hockey game all around but I would like it if you added arms and a little more detail to the goalie glove. Other than that great game üëç,"I was playing goalie mode a while ago and i put my headset down for a minute t grab something, when i got back and out it back on everything was tiny even my hands, when i went back to the menu the sticks, helmets, my hands, and puck were all still tiny, I've shut the game and headset down then turned it back on, restarted my headset and nothing, plus the discord link doesn't work and I'm really disappointed because the goalie mode was excellent",The game is amazing physics are good but the ai goaltending is bad mabye add goalie animations to really make the game better,"But the only thing that makes this not my number one game is, there is no story mode"
