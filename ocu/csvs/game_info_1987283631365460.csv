As with the previous 2 games you are generally static in the 'world' (although there is more dynamism to this mechanic in this version), the graphics are ok and the gameplays the same as the other 2 games, overall the third iteration is pretty much of the same as the first and second game and with almost any other game this would be a negative but with the IEYTD franchise it is a strength. Schell games discovered a golden formula with these games and continue to build an amazing VR world. Great puzzles, fantastic stories and brilliant use of VR. My whole family play through these games so well worth the purchase.","Ok, it’s not that old, but it’s older. In terms of graphics, mechanics, and storyline, it’s one of, if not my favorite VR game. And then there’s the soundtrack! The opening credit song is amazing to listen to while doing chores, but when you’re experiencing the visuals with the song? Top tier. I think it’s only topped by the sequel, in my book.",I CRIED AT THE ENDING😢😭😢😭😢😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😢😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😢😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😢😢😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😭😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😭😭😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭😢😭
