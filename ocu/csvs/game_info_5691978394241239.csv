I took a break after starting the second chapter, and now the game spawns me outside of the room. Resetting my progress didn't help. Up to this point I've loved the game, but now it's dead in the water for me. Update: I uninstalled and reinstalled the game last night (before I saw the response here), and finished Chapter 2. Score is updated accordingly. I thought everything was really fun and logical. Can't wait for more!","It's an escape room game. I like how it saves your place exactly! It's cool to play this little garage band sized game. My top suggestion to the devs is to improve the footstep sounds. Have multiple sounds for carpet, floor etc.... Multiple sounds for crawling and walking. I want to hear some creaking floorboards. Easy to do and can add lots of immersion.","The game mechanics are very creative, though the game is not very long.","Good physics interactions, but some puzzle steps are relatively hard. Spooky atmosphere."
