Everything from picking up toys with guns to dancing with guns to flipping burgers with guns brought back memories of my days growing up in the US of A. I don't want to say too much more because that would spoil the game, but I would like to say that the developers have done an excellent job. I was extremely surprised to learn that they are based in Australia and not the Land of the Free (TM). Bravo. Regarding the 1-star reviews I'm seeing about this game, though--do you people hate America? I'm surprised and saddened by the negativity! 'MURCA!!!","Funny parody of the American Culture. I understand it’s satire and that’s what makes it hilarious. My only thing is it’s not really replayable. Once you’ve played it, there’s no real reason to go back and play it again.","I live in the USA, or as we call it here, AMERICA!! In America we do have some of the finest guns. In this VR experience I enjoyed getting to use them in ways I'd never imagined. What is in this satirical take on our gun acceptance makes very real points and personally gave me a few history lessons. I like that they included an intermission! My problem I encountered while playing was during the fish boss battle because my gun could not reload so I had to reboot. Besides that, I personally found the ending odd and lackluster.","But as a worried mom, appreciator of excellent writing AND a lifelong gamer who uses VR to escape the hellscape that is American life these days I cannot express how much this game impressed me. Sure, I’m exhausted from capitalism and everything is a crapshow and I have no idea if my youngest will even make it out of HS thanks to guns, but this bite-sized arcade-style game really makes me feel like my 47 years of struggle and worry have not gone unnoticed by smart game developers in countries who actually give a flying crap about their citizens. If you’re a knuckle dragging, gun loving MAGA gamer, one who likely adores Andrew Tate and thinks people should arm up in a Target to buy diapers, prepare to write a “I wish I could give this zero stars” review. If you’re just exhausted and want to laugh at the absolute absurdity of American culture but you also really miss Jon Stewart, this is for you. I’ve never LOLd at a game through tears of sadness the way this has made me LOL. Kudos to the writers. You nailed it.",I love the game and atmosphere. It feels like a step back in time
