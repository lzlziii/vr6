Uni Live Viewer,"This is a VR live viewer application that allows you to easily check out dance performances by anime-style characters. You can decorate items and enjoy double speed dancing. Vroid simple load and pass-through functions have also been added. ※Currently, the application will not start without ""Allow file access"" at startup. ※Please summon in the playback state, as there is a problem of misalignment during playback if summoned in the stopped state. If you have a PC, you can further customize the live performance by loading VRM models, VMD dances, and music files. →For detailed instructions, please check the official website or readme.txt in the app's dedicated folder. The app is still under development, various updates are planned at irregular intervals.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Music, Music Video, Simulation","English, Japanese",0.6.9a,Nana Ciel,Nana Ciel,https://mocatea.github.io/UniLiveViewer/,"Nov 11, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4108471262596874/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4108471262596874&r=1, https://mocatea.github.io/UniLiveViewer/PrivacyPolicy.html",532.4 MB,I love this so much this is an anime fans dream or at least mine it’s my new favorite app on my quest and I will tell Everyone I know too totally get this too But pls add more cosmetics and a few more built-in songs too I don’t have a pc and can’t afford one so I’d love if there were more songs too so pls add more ❤️❤️❤️,"The game keeps getting better! the passtrough function is perfect, it would take a selective passtrough, maybe the ability to use handtraking as a second option. one of the limits is certainly represented by the model that has its own dance path to complete, and in case of passthrough it becomes very difficult to create a program that takes into account real obstacles and walls by automatically modifying the character's dance, and in fact the model through walls and real obstacles. a possible solution in addition to the selective passage could be to visualize at the moment of the placement of the character the dance path or the furthest extreme points in which it will come to move, in order to position it in such a way that it does not cross walls or that it does not meet ( and you cross) obstacles, these are just ideas without commitment. Thanks for the work you do, a great app is sure to come out. I've already started importing templates, perfect! - - One of the great things would be to create a human paired dance mode where the model is equipped with a.i. to interact with the dance performed by the person, with the possibility, as happened in the oculus app ""frist steps"", to grab the hands of the model during the dance and make him do pirolettes etc. (like the robot in the first steps, but with greater al.) In addition to the possibility to choose between different dances and music (honestly the last dance is a bit too chaotic and uncoordinated, as if the model had drunk too much wine: D)","It's beautifull and so real ! Two thumbs up to developpers. Thanks guy ! waiting for more, now ...",Everything is gucci! Nice! Just please add more stage options. Overall cool!
