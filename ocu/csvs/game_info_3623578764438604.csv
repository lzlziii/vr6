Quest Vallisaari Island,"This visual immersion allows the navigation in three different environments: (1) a night scene on the main pond of the Island, revealing an under the water version of Helsinki; (2) inside the 19th-century fort Alexander Battery, where the user can navigate in its interior while watching fragments of the past on the walls; and (3) the external area of the fort Alexander Battery, showing a beautiful sunset and interactive walls where the user can play with sounds of nature, composing their own soundscape on the island. Vallisaari Island VR experience was developed by Finnish VR Studio Zoan in collaboration with Facebook Open Arts. Facebook Open Arts is Helsinki Biennialâ€™s supporting partner.
