Multiverse,"Dusty multiverse is an official Virtual Burning Man experience and it is an interactive and immersive social platform that thrives on artistic collaboration and participation on a global scale. You can enjoy many unique experiences just like a live Burning man: For examples, performers of all types can broadcast themselves live to a global audience and gift their art in many ways. Participants can also communicate in real time via live voice chat. You appear as a customized 3D avatar and will be able to see some of the official Burning Man honoraria art, along with some of the famous Burning Man Sound camps. DJs will be broadcasting live music 24/7. You can dance with others, and you can participate in many interesting social experiences.",12+,"Multiplayer, Co-op",Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Music, Relaxation/Meditation, Simulation",English,0.2,Clipo Labs,Clipo Labs,https://clipolabs.com/,"Aug 11, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4140152679403866/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4140152679403866&r=1, https://dustymultiverse.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,721.5 MB,"Don't waste your time just goes to a black screen waste of time , would not let me give it zero Star -0 stars fix your stuff","Don't know how many users this will garner, but it had it's own spin on the VR burning man saga, and it was indicative of quality.","It has my oculus stuck on installing this app. I canâ€™t install it , nor can I update or install anything because of it","Riding a hoverboard around virtual burning man?
