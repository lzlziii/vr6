Unless ninja legends 2 comes out or a clone with ninjaüê¢,This game is fast paced and exciting! Must have for anyone into Samurai / Ninja.,"As a current practitioner of ninjutsu, I found the game to be extremely addictive! I love it! There is so much you can do within the game that makes it one you can play for hours. The weapons are awesome and so are the stages. Can't say enough about how truly awesome this game is.","Visit linktr,ee/gaving7095 for 25 % off this game and many more üòÄ I feel that time has moved on since this game came out. There have been a number of free content updates but there are just better examples of cross genre on quest now - such as Fruit Ninja 2. In any event visit my linktr.ee for links for 25 % off this game and many more.","This game is solid fun and makes you feel like a ninja. Blocking swords and projectiles, timing your hits, general ninjaness. The only reason I don't play it more is it does not reward good form. It does not care if the blade edge is aligned or you take a big swing. The blades have minimal inertia, so the most effective way to dispatch enemies is to do ""wiggle-sword"" in their bellies. That being said, if you just want to be a ninja, it is super awesome if you just lean into the role-playing, take big swings and try to slice people in half. Fruit Ninja with ninjas. Ninja Ninja. Also, they come to you, so no motion sickness. Kinda un-ninja like to be honest. I should be running and hiding and putting fake heads on my shoulders and throwing poison darts. But we're not going for historical accuracy here, we're going for the history written by ninjas after ninjas take over."
