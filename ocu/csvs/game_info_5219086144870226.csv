Krispain Hero Roguelite Dungeon Shooter Simulator,"Is a randomly generated multi-level adventure game with elements of 3rd person shooter and RPG. What can go through a former warriorâ€™s head upon seeing an incomprehensible portal in the middle of the road? It is to go through the portal, of course, to explore an alternative past, where the world is definitely not ruled by people. SURVIVE IN AN UNKNOWN PAST TIMELINE!!! At different levels, you will find different kinds of weapons and upgrade items, you will find checkpoints and you will face many challenging battles. Each location is teeming with monsters and deadly bosses looking to put an end to your life. Defeat all the bosses to get out of the alternative universe, or return to continue your adventure to see how far can you go. Features: Experience a game that combines shooter gameplay with rogue-like, allowing you to experience the game differently each time. Over 10 different weapons, including 2 hidden ones to find! Over 30 unique items to improve the strength and skills ",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Adventure, Shooter",English,1.2,Midnight Works,Midnight Games,https://midnight.works/,"Nov 9, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5219086144870226/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5219086144870226&r=1, https://midnight.works/privacy",Terms of Service,489.5 MB,"Never heard of this game, so after a quick look at the Nintendo version on YouTube, I thought this might be a good laugh. Graphically it's not bad, and you move around nicely, but there are a few things that needs serious work... 1) Presentation - Very basic. No leaderboards, nothing that would drive you to replay this. 2) Remove the annoying pointer red lines during the game. 3) This is the nail in the coffin for me - The weapons. Everything about the weapons is awful. The handling, the graphics, the sound FX, no vibration. One or two guns made a pathetic unrealistic tap tap noise. I kept restarting the game thinking there was a glitch and everything will be fine after I restarted. Nope. Shame.","I really want to play this game, please fix the problems. Can't pick up the next weapon, plz remove red lines. I love roguelike games and was so excited to try this one out, so plz fix. I think this game could be really fun. Thank you."
