I'm Artemis Magnus. I've played nearly 1000 matches of Hibow. Hibow is a fast paced game with plenty of weapons and heroes to choose from to suit your playstyle. It has a friendly community and great modes to play. The FPS is awesome. I hardly lag during games. Hibow has Bot matches. Store to grind for cosmetics and a leaderboard if you are feeling competitive! There's also events every now and then with their own rewards for the top players.,"Awesome Bow & Arrow gameplay. With Battle Royal & Bot training. Team deathmatch is coming soon. Hopefully, the wait is not too long. Gameplay ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Awesome Bow & Arrow Combat Multi-player ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è Playing with others is fun, but only Battler Royal is available Hud & UI ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è I can't quick see most of my hud, but I'm not sure if there is an option to move it in more. My Gameplay experiences: I played a game of IO with bots; The combat was great, soaring through the air sniping bots was fun. I used the scattershot for effective close range. The grip trigger for swapping is a very quick and effective way of gaining the upper hand in combat. This game is great for a person who likes bows. I also played a battle royal game with 10 other players; Most of the players dropped at the same location. I dropped back further away and missed most of the action. I did receive those awesome chicken legs for winning a game. I did have some trouble with loading in a black screen, but developers Chesstar & Jackstar from Discord helped me fix this issue. Their support is quick and friendly. I would suggest supporting them with the supporter upgrade (details on Discord).",It wouldn‚Äôt let me play I was stuck on the starting screen I couldn‚Äôt make my character!!!,"I recently just played it today, and I already love the concept of this game. I‚Äôm a be fan of shooting/bow games so this is definitely my kind of game. The motion and controls work very well. The more you play, the better you get. I how there are different kinds of bows and arrows that come along with this, which I really like the most about this game. Plus the attachments, body armor and force field etc , are great!! Keep it upüòã.","Love this game. Ever since I started watching vr content, I wanted an oculus then I got one, and this game was my second priority (gorilla tag was first), and it is amazing! Free, good mechanics, great controls and movement. I would recommend this to anyone who is just buying a quest. Great job guys! Keep it up!"
