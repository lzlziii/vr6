Shinobi no mono - Preface,"Japan 1683 - Aogashima Island Oda Ishida, a renegade samurai takes up arms to avenge his lord who was savagely murdered by the men of Ishi Kinoshita, a local lord from the Tokugawa region. It is on this island that the legend of Shinobi no mono begins.",12+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Adventure, Fighting","English, French (France)",1.6,Nicolas Pincemin,Unity,https://shinobinomono.pagesperso-orange.fr/,"Sep 13, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5565050720274709/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5565050720274709&r=1, https://shinobinomono.pagesperso-orange.fr/privacy-policy.html",621.4 MB,Phenomenal. Perfect. Down to the last minute detail.,"Itâ€™s really fun but after a few times dying it kind of gets boring. The enemies are way too strong a basic one takes like ten swing to kill and they are also really fast so itâ€™s hard to use my bow or stars. Iâ€™m not sure if I just havenâ€™t figured it out yet or not but I canâ€™t jump. It would be a lot better if I could jump. I think the game would be more fun and exiting if you were able to customize your character or your item placement. Overall though this is a very good game. I like how you can slow down time so you can basically kill your enemies by pressing the slow button and the swinging your katana. I also really like the climbing feature itâ€™s really fun and no other katana or ninja game have it. The bow and stars are also really useful, letâ€™s say you want to kill an enemy without getting three or four come and chase you you can shoot them (if you hold your bow horizontally your shots are more direct:)) I really like how there is kind of like a whole level of a tutorial thatâ€™s super fun to play.","The game is in prerelease! Expect bugs / glitches in the game. Just because the game isn't suuuuuuper brightly polished is NOT a Reason to uninstall it! Give the dev some time to finish production and THEN you can judge their game. I'll play when I find the time to do so. until then, ðŸ’¥ gabagool ðŸ’¥",I tried rejoining Uninstall and it won't let me use a arrow,"Only criticism i have is health issues. Seeing enemy health would possibly be nice or maybe a certain amount of hits. I have fun but taking 10+ swings to kill a regular enemy seems a bit much, understandable on the armored enemy though. Possibly giving critical points to attack, a damage/health system, or set amount of hits to kill an enemy would make this game to tier in my opinion."
