NOW I AM PRETTY CERTAIN YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!,"Awesome game, lots of replay ability, cool artstyle, and good modeling. I feel like it’s a little too ‘neon’ though and the tutorials could use a little bit more explanation. Though I understand that the tutorials will likely change over time, as the game is still being worked on and has AMAZING potential. The creators seem to listen to their fans (with them asking for a jump button and it being added in the form of an item), and it actually runs on my crappy quest 1. Sorta. It runs well enough to have a good time. I am definitely looking forward to the direction this game goes in!!",9/10 game by the way,This game is really fun and pretty challenging as well! The level editor is easy to use and the community levels are also great. Keep up the good work!,We have multiplayer but we need more! Which mean we need to see like 10 or more lobby’s to join. Also we need another update lol.
