Basically, this is an album presented with a fully-realized and engaging VR environment. The music is actually really nice and appropriate for the visuals. The interactivity is extremely well thought out and engaging. I could hype it further, but needless to say it's something you'll need to check out yourself to see how you enjoy it. I think the creators did a fantastic job--creating an app like this not only helps promote their music, but adds true engagement. It's also really well executed in VR and is fun, relaxing, and memorable. I probably sound like a shill, but I enjoy it quite a bit and am impressed at how innovative it is. It's a free app and I highly recommend checking it out.",Quite a nice application to allow musicians to promote their music along with the programmers. Fun! Love the interaction.,"Once you learn the controls, this is a cool way to interact with music. I love the minimalist art style, and how the experience is customized for different songs.","The little thumbnail picture for this app looked promising. It turns out, that it was not that intuitive, which made it difficult to get immersed and it didn’t really make me want to explore it more. COSMIC SUGAR on the other hand was great. I think I was looking for more of that experience.","an elegant, efficient, real and immersive experience: a pure moment of pleasure"
