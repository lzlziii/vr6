I first played this on a smartphone clipped into a cheap, blurry 3d viewer before the original Quest came out, and got really hooked on it. Only discovered this was out on Quest now by chance. Love that you can still use your head-movement to steer. It's a perfect sit-down and trip-out game. The graphics are simple but really effective, and I love the lighting and changing colours. So many modes, too. Lovely game!","It's an old VR game, now available on the Quest 2 / Quest Pro as well. I'm having a ton of fun with it. There are various modes featuring diverse flying machines, accompanied by fantastic music, and entertaining gameplay. It's highly engaging and always suitable for a quick round in between other activities.","I just picked this up yesterday. There's a lot of content here, especially for the price. The music is cool and the graphics - while simple - are very well done. The completionist in me is trying to finish every level with a 3-star rating, but the objectives are a little vague. So, I have a few questions for the dev(s): What exactly is the rating system based on? What does the green progress bar indicate - is it the linear progress through the level? How about the number that rapidly counts down? And the number (0, -1, -2) that you're awarded at the end of each level? Thanks!","This is a lot of fun and all the different modes make this a must have. If you want to fly avoiding the obstacles, then there are modes for that. If you want to blast your way through obstacles and ships, there's a mode for that. Superb value for money as well! I must admit I had to come off after a while as the motion sickness was starting to kick in, but I believe once I get used to this game, it should be fine. I'd like some vibration on the controllers when firing or when crashing into things. Without it, it doesn't feel right. I'd love to see a chase mode, where you are chasing down and shooting ships while dodging obstacles. That would be the icing on the already delicious cake!"
