It is an interesting concept that definitely offers room for more immersive story-telling and engaging puzzles. Looking forward to future updates!","Wow what a cool idea! Had a lot of fun with this, needs a little more polish but it's really fun and weird so far. Had my eyes on this a while, looking forward to where it goes in the future","And now I need more...!!It took me a couple of tries to really grasp the right gameplay for sure, but after that, it was pretty straightforward what needed to be done in order to solve the dream. Time is of the essence people, but don’t get frustrated!! You need to be VERY observant, check everything no matter how bizarre it may seem to you…The voice of the guide might seem a bit distorted but I actually felt like I was indeed trying to hear someone’s voice while dreaming, nice touch!! Nice visuals for a Beta but I would like to see the finished product. Can’t wait to see the other dreams and how will they come to life!! And I would like to know more about the whole concept and some interesting things shown in the game…","I'll be waiting for this one to come out! I loved the visuals and audio, they give a feeling of both mystery and serenity. It certainly could do with some more polishing, especially the audio, but it is still a beta after all. The setting is also interesting, has to do with lucid dreaming. There isn't much of a story yet, save for a static screen in the beginning that gives a very generic mythical background, but I'm sure this will be fleshed out in time. The puzzles are very simple but fun - I won't spoil it for others, but the end was imaginative, to say the least! It also helps to be observant! It took me a few attempts to wrap my mind around the dream logic of it all and solve it, but it was a nice little brain teaser!","The game has a really interesting setting. At the start of the game, I felt very relaxed and enjoyed the scenery, which is quite beautiful, but at the moment some scenes were not populated as much as the other. Later I found out that the puzzles are time bound, and that a certain event will occur, which will make you want to solve the puzzle like an escape room in real life. Because this is the first kind of game I have played in this kind of genre, it took me two tries to understand the clues given in the game. The demo only has one dream for you to play at the moment, but I can't wait for more content!"
