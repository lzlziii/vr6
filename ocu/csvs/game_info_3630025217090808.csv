I have been wanting to try drumming irl for a long time but never really got to it. So when I saw this game in the store I knew I had to get it. Although it might be hard at first, as you practice and get better it‚Äôs really rewarding. The songs in my opinion are great. (Even though yes, I would like to see some well known artists too, but I know the devs are hard at work to make that happen.) Some of them I have added to my playlist because I like them so much. The classic mode is a little harder for me to get a grasp on, since I have little experience in music but I keep practicing because once I get it down I know it will be really rewarding. The arcade mode is really good as well, better for the casual player. The only weird thing I noticed is sometimes the tracking kinda acts up and the stick goes through the drums. I don‚Äôt know if its a problem on my end or it‚Äôs the game but either way it‚Äôs only a minor issue. Overall the whole game is really addictive. I have to get my daily fix of it everyday. It‚Äôs a pretty good workout as well. Easily 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è",The normal game I thought was pretty fun back when it was on app lab. After the full release adding the classic mode was awesome. I‚Äôm surprised how good the music selection. I hope that they add dlc song packs in the future because I would totally buy those. Great game if you like drumming.,"‚û°Ô∏è quest25.bio.link Get % Off for Quest Games ---- ‚û°Ô∏è My new Projekt: Deals24.net ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ---- Title: A Rhythmic Masterpiece - Smash Drums is an Impressive VR Game! Review: Smash Drums is an extraordinary VR game that immediately captivated me with its impressive rhythm and captivating gameplay. As an enthusiastic VR player and music lover, Smash Drums completely won me over with its creative execution and unique gaming experience. The gameplay of Smash Drums is simply brilliant. You step onto an exhilarating stage and become the drummer, hitting the beats of the music. The precise control of the VR controllers allows you to drum with ease and accuracy. The variety of songs and rhythms offers a wide range of musical genres, catering to every taste. The graphics and design of Smash Drums are aesthetically appealing. The vibrant stage atmosphere and creative visual effects create an immersive gaming world. The colorful presentation and dynamic movements enhance the feeling of being part of a real live performance. The musical accompaniment in Smash Drums is another highlight. The high-quality soundtracks and enthralling beats create a captivating experience. The music seamlessly blends with the gameplay, allowing you to get lost in the rhythm. Another plus of Smash Drums is the competitive mode. The game allows you to compete with other players and strive for the best time. The competitive aspect motivates you to improve constantly and set new records. Smash Drums is an essential experience for all VR players and music enthusiasts. It offers an impressive rhythm experience that impresses with its creative execution and captivating music. With its brilliant gameplay, aesthetic graphics, and competitive mode, Smash Drums delighted me from start to finish. If you're looking for a virtual drumming experience that immerses you in the rhythm, then Smash Drums is the perfect choice!","This game puts drum sticks in your hands giving you the chance go rock out to some amazing (though be it unknown) music. I find my self playing this game until my wrists hurt due to the obsessive part of me wanting to try to perfect the songs as much as I possibly can. This game isn‚Äôt perfect however, some noticeable issues I‚Äôve noticed is that classic mode can have quite the learning curve, and there is no sort of tutorial that will help you with the classic side of the game. This makes classic difficult to get in to due to needing to figure out the different difficulties as well as needing to get a feel of the drum set on your own. With time, you can figure this out, and I recommend changing sides and height of everything to find what‚Äôs most comfortable. Another issue is that the songs though amazing, are few and rather unknown. It would be amazing to get some songs that are better known, or even to have the ability to mod songs in to the game. I would also love to see buttons on the controls used to clamp or unclamp the hat so that certain songs could be played as intended, tho this is obviously just a nit pick Over all this game is great, and has potential to be better, though I highly doubt there will be any more updates to the game.","Smash Drums deserves more than 5 stars really . The quality of the game and playability in VR is exceptional. I get a buzz whenever i am playing drums and its no different In VR with Headphones on. There's only 1 thing missing and that's DLC.. I have rockband and drums for xbox and around 80% of dlc released which keeps the game alive and me very happy. I would be more than happy to pay for DLC in Smash Drums and i hear there is talk that DLC will be happen too. Fingers crossed. If you compare this to games like beatsaber and synth riders(which i have)then this comes tops. the others are ok if you want to workout and get sweaty but if you want to actually feel the music playing then Smash Drums instead. You will get a workout still and you will experience what its like to play drums for real and imho, Enjoy playing so much more. All this game needs is more content(DLC) I really hope the developers can get some great tracks. It won't be easy and probably expensive for them with licensing but i reckon the gamers who are playing Smash Drums want and will pay for DLC content so Please bring us lots more content. It's my favorite game from the store and it's soooooo cheap compared to what i paid for Rockband and the drumkit. If your thinking of buying this game then just do it now. You will have fun i guarantee."
