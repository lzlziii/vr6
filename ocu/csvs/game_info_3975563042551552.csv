Just wanted to get some idea of scale and atmosphere, which would be helped by a few things: remove the modern weapons, unrealistic scale, missiles, lasers; provide realistic ship viewpoint(s) - as in one you'd actually have such as bridge - without the daft sliding.","I recently stream this from my YouTube channel and was surprised by how much I liked this game. Sound effects are good and you get a feeling for what it must've felt like during WWII when you see your ship rocked from a huge explosion , I hope the devs have plans to add more ships even if it's paid dlc , assuming ships have strengths and weaknesses makes the game all the more strategic , at $3 it's definitely worth a look if you're into battleships"
