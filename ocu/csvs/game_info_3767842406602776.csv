Throwing boomerangs to protect beer, doesn't get more Aussie than that. Oh, wait it can- There are koalas and a dijeridoo too! This is such a unique and fun game that most definitely should be played standing! Who knew that chucking boomerangs at little kangaroos would be so enjoyable! They are quick so stay on your toes! I think this is a must have game that appeals to everyone.","This game surprised me! I am so glad I decided to try it! Such a blast to play!! While the idea is simple, the game is a ton of fun! We enjoy taking turns playing and watching each other play. You punch or throw boomerangs to protect your beers from kangaroos and koalas (so far). I even picked one of the kangaroos up and slammed him. You also need to keep your beers in the cooler to stay cold. There is campaign, arcade, and free modes as well as easy and normal settings so all ages can play! It is 360 play, so you never know where these rascals are going to come from! Gameplay mechanics are smooth, graphics are bright and fun. I TOTALLY recommend this game! Tons of fun for the whole family.",This game is so underrated! Itâ€™s such a fun workout and a must buy all the animals are so cute and cute the physics are amazing I would buy it if I were you!,"How could you possibly be burning calories while chugging some devilish Aussie beers? What about tossing some mean boomerangs on some kleptomaniac 'roos and other sick local fauna without PETA being aware of the carefree but innocent monstrosity? WELP, this game packs it in with a punch, delivering some of the most fun I had in years. Highly recommend!!",Fun game to play as single player. Not the same format of other games. Would consider it a hidden gem.
