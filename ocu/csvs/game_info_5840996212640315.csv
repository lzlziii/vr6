But the problem is, you only have 15 minutes a day, so you need to pay to be able to play more and I just find that so annoying. I don't want to have to waste my money playing this game when it would have been so easy to just make a free demo and a paid full release.",I really like the mechanics of this game it makes you feel so agile and the gameplay is intense for VR but pretty intuitive. But like some other people said it would have been better to have released a demo and a paid version of it so you don’t have only 15 minutes to play,Everything is good. You shouldn’t make it where the demo is longer than 15 minutes. ￼ and I really hope you do because this game is kind of addicting. ￼,i've only played the first 15 minutes you get from the demo and i can already recommend it the way it controls and looks feels so nice and polished railgun scope kinda jank though ngl
