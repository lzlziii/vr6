I've seen better graphics but so far the closest thing I'll ever get to hitting bombs over the Green Monster in Fenway Park. The flight of the ball off the bat way too fast and feels unrealistic. There is a limited amount of time to swing for the fences which kinda blows. It would be way more fun if you had a batting practice mode where you can take unlimited swings and maybe try to hit curveballs and 100mph heaters with movement. Or maybe even has a scenario mode of fictional or maybe actual historic scenerios where it's the bottom of 9th inning with runners on base and Ortiz gets up against Rivera. A lot of potential here but few suggestions would make this game so much more fun.,"The only things I can complain about is the fact that the game could really use graphical improvements on the newer devices, and maybe a longer time limit on the round you play. As well as a little nitpick from me being the fact that some teams bat tape is a solid color while other teams have their name and logos, makes the other teams feel left out like my fav team Cleveland. In the end worth the money and is good fun.",I love this game its fun and realistic,I really love the game. Unfortunately several stadiums crash from time to time. So the game has to be restarted. Was never able to play in Baltimore - not sure why?
