But I do have problems with gripping items with hand tracking but besides that it is very fun. WE NEED A TIME SLOW DEVICE :),"I put about 2 hours into this game now and I'm starting to get a feel for it. I took the devs advice below which helps. The issue with the physical behaving differently on each run isnt is manageable. It effects how you build things and you can work around it. I dont know if they plan to fix that or that's just how it will be. For me it's no longer a huge problem. The game is really fun and addictive and its satisfying when you get a long track that does all kinds of crazy stuff. Another problem I was having is with the hand tracking, which works about as good as it can but for this game you need precise placement so better to use the controllers. Another review mentioned that its passthrough only I dont see why this is a problem. They probably didnt even make it to the options menu because there are a number of different passthrough fx you can use. But obviously passthrough makes the game way better. You lose track of time because it feels like you're just building tracks inside your own room. it's a great deal for the price. It feels polished, addictive and very easy to pick up and play.","I was so looking forward to playing this,which I did and set up a quick and simple track with dominos and a ball and it worked a treat, watching it go around my room. I saved it and when I returned to the game,the saved machine I had was missing all the tracks and grabbing was an issue. Basically,this should not have been released in this state,saves are very important and to work correctly. Well,when the patch arrives to address the saves and the grabbing,then I will improve my review. Very disappointed it's not ready,please fix soon. Would not recommend at the moment,sorry to say.","This is a beautiful game, I love to tinker around. This game is fun, and for $10.81, I don't expect much from this game. It has glitches and one of them keep disappearing. yesterday I made a portal machine, only to find out, I can not save the machine the way I created it. The track I made out for the machine keep disappearing after I have saved it. So then, I deleted ‚ùå the save machine. Closed the app, came back later tried again the same thing happened, the machine I made didn't save properly and out of frustration and disappointment, I got off this game thinking about getting a refund but at the same time saying to myself But I love this game. I would give this game five stars, if they will fix the glitch, when you save machine and when you load machine back parts are missing."
