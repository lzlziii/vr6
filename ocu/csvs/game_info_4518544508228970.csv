Bullet Time,"Bullet time is a casual action VR game inspired by movies and games of the same genre. In particular, we wanted to focus on the balletic grace of slow motion gun fights. The game pits you against multiple AIs in a simulation world, where reality has blended with fantasy. You are fighting to escape the virtual world that you have been forced into. Note that the game is in early access, so there will be much more content to come!",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Fighting",English,1.03,Eyemobi,Eyemobi Ltd,http://www.eyemobi.com/,"Jun 13, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4518544508228970/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4518544508228970&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HZaHZpe5ixhULMTwIYIePog3306bmU2ouZETYcrpVlA/edit#heading=h.pm2rflisozp3",181.4 MB,The pistols are practically angled up to my head. I guess suicide would be a better use of time than this game.,"It will take about 15 minutes at a slower pace to finish the 3 levels in this early access release. It could've easily been released as a demo for free, but for $1, it's still worth it, as I can definitely see the potential, as long as the devs continue to work and expand upon it. The ai bots aren't the brightest, as they'll just stand there at times or come rushing at you which makes them quite easy to take down, but they do have good accuracy. The bullet time effect is well done and overall the graphics and sound are decent for this style of game. I truly hope the devs add smooth locomotion for turning, as I personally hate snap turning in games. This game also needs missions/levels that are a lot longer than 4 or 5 minutes, or maybe 1 or 2 if you rush through them, as there is potential, but currently it's difficult to know what the devs have planned. An update/response from them would be great. All in all, I'll give it a 3/5 for now, as it currently has more polish than many other games in early access. :)","it's a shame, the gun is set to be at the angle of the Avatars finger, and not the grip of a gun barrel. so constantly aiming Down to be on target. fix this and it'll be ace.","Cool start! Can you adjust the hand gun angles plz, also smooth turning is welcome. Still really early, but fun."
