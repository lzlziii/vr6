Street Sense,"Welcome to Street Sense, an interactive game that teaches some of the skills you need to be a safer driver in real life. In this game, you'll get to drive around on virtual roads and learn important things like how to spot dangerous situations on the road, how to turn safely, and how to share the road with others. Street Sense is for new drivers who are just starting out and for experienced drivers who want to get better at driving. You'll experience different driving situations and learn how to deal with them, just like you would in real life. As you drive around, you'll need to keep an eye out for potential dangers and use special tools in the game to help you if you get stuck. These tools are called ""power-ups"" and they can help you out when you need it the most. When you're feeling confident, you can take a test to see how much you've learned in the Street Sense Road Test. So, are you ready to become a great driver? Let's play Street Sense and learn how to drive safely!",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Education",English,0.1.0.4409,Project Whitecard Inc.,Project Whitecard Studios,https://www.icbc.com/road-safety/crashes-happen/Pages/street-sense.aspx,"May 11, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4514454108642986/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4514454108642986&r=1, https://projectwhitecard.com/pwc/pwcmont/privacy-policy/",778.0 MB,"Much more is needed to make it a course to learn to drive, such as more areas and above all a better grip at the wheel, how to press a grip button to take the wheel, a better graphics engine, an open world map to drive with freedom In Increase your expectations, it is a very good idea, also the setback and a more immersive parking section. fix the controls and the steering wheel sometimes the steering wheel is difficult to move so if you want this to become something super you must improve the graphic quality and rendering","You barely do anything, and the controls are crap. At least put a free ride mode in the game!","Being an older driver, I wanted to see how helpful this program could be in helping new drivers, or even experienced one's. Sadly, it turns out to be a controlled experience, meaning you can only react the way the program wants you to in each scenario, or else you will fail and have to do it over again, until you do what they want you to do to pass and move on to the next scenario. You're basically being told and controlled instead of perceiving and reacting naturally to unpredictable situations. If you fail the first time, you know exactly what to expect the second time. When you fail, and are told why, the instructor's voice is extremely monotone and also slow in delivering the reason(s) why you failed. It just adds to the overall boring experience of this program. I honestly feel it would've been much more effective to have the driver (user) put into random/unpredictable scenario's where they're actually driving through city streets or on the highway for 5-30 minutes, with the final tally of what they did wrong or right at the end. If they end up in a collision or hitting a pedestrian during the scenario, then it would end instantly. At the moment, this program is comparable to reading a rules of the road manual, because it ends up being more of a this way is the right and only way to pass, instead of allowing the user to react more naturally to random events. I'm not saying that the program is totally ineffective, as it does explain the rules of the road, but real driving is all about being aware of everything going on around you, and is never predictable. I was hoping it would be more like City Car Driving Simulator, that lets you know while driving if you're following the rules of the road or breaking them, and/or gives you a final rating at the end of the test. I just feel that you missed a big opportunity in being able to help people perceive and react quickly to unpredictable events.","The only thing u can do is brake and advance, u cannot turn by urself â€¦ its well boring."
