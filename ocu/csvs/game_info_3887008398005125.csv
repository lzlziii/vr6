Mobile VR Station,"This is the third re-write of Mobile VR Station and was based upon the successful iOS/Android versions, but re-imagined to work only in VR. The player has been built from the ground up to display 2D & 3D content on various projections such as Plane, Spherical, Dome, Full Dome, Curved and EAC. The player will continue in its freemium tradition and allows you to try all features before buying. The only limitation of the free version is it will only play the first five minutes of any video, but you are free to make sure it works with your content and has all the needed features at your leisure. We offer support on our Facebook page if you have any questions and links are available inside the app to our various pages, online tutorials and the extensive help guide.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing","Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", 360 Experience (non-game), Media Player, Utility",English,"2023.08.28

It loads like it would and show the title (mobile vr station with the lil robot dude next to it) then it just crashes and goes back to the home page. Android really messed up with this update! Gave it 5 stars cause the guy who made this really wants the best an easiest experience to mod vr games. Android deserves the 1 star hell even a zero star for this update they released. So yeah for now the app is down (AGAIN this could only be me, but everything else opened and worked the way it should) if you're having the same problem maybe share your story and we can finally solve the problem android caused. So for now anyone who's thinking to buy bonelab, blade and sorcery, contractors or any other game that's open for modding I would wait for a lil bit and try out something else! Recommendations (resident evil 4, pavlov shack [it's free! For now at least], walking dead, after the fall and some others.) Hopefully this review can help someone have a good day and hopefully we can go back to modding without having to do all the tidieous steps just to add a mod! Again michael thank you for the awesome app you did an amazing job! Hopefully we can all fix this together as a community much love! Have a great day!","So I don’t know if my app is just broken or something but whenever I try to install mods from Nexus for Blades and Sorcery Nomad, my mods don’t show up in the app. I don’t know if it’s just me but yeah. It’s still broken for me even after the update","As you know V51 has broken the modding app and desert are trying to fix it at the moment, all I ask is, how can I help development? I might not be a huge help in updating but I want to try to help, Thank you.","So, for those who don’t know, Meta update V51 has broken this app. Currently, the guy who made it is trying to fix it. It makes it so that an app can only look at files related to that app, making it impossible to mod. I know it’s very annoying, but we have to be patient. He said he is around half way done getting it fixed, so it should be working soon. Happy modding!",So you might be wondering “I followed the instructions but I still can’t mod” you need to use the stored storage to mod bonelab for those who wondered. I didn’t go through the entire video to do it but I figured it out. So those who don’t want to watch the video this is how you do it. Accept access to files>crash to home>mod.io>chose what mod you like>install on stored storage>bonelab mods or save I do both>and boom you got mods on
