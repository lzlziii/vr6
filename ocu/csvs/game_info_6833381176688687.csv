highrescue,"""highrescue"" is a virtual reality game in which you can prove your skills as an astronaut rescuer in 4 different levels. To achieve the best results, we recommend starting with the training level. Each mission always starts with different initial conditions. The position of the astronauts in space varies. The supply of oxygen can also be different. Therefore, keep calm and get an overview of the situation first. First supply the astronauts who need it most with oxygen. Save the astronauts with the highest priority who have the least oxygen left. Also pay attention to your health and the energy level of your jet stream. Good luck on your adventures.
