Mystery Box VR - Escape The Room,"""Mystery Box VR"" is a puzzle game where you have to interact with bizarre mechanisms, think out of the box to crack odd riddles, and gain your freedom. You can play this game in Standing mode, using joysticks to rotate around the box, or in Roomscale mode, walking around the tables (best game experience). If you get stuck on solving a puzzle, hit the A or X button on the controller to get a hint. Step into the unknown, and be a mastermind in an exciting adventure.

It's reminiscent of another favourite of mine The Room. The graphics are great and it's got a good difficulty curve, you don't ever feel too lost with the tips and advice on hand should you get stuck. I did not find the controls awkward at all, i believe this was addressed in a recent update. The developer's ongoing support is excellent, I love the addition of The Enigmas box giving you reason to keep checking back once you have finished the main quest line. Definitely worth checking out if you love interactive puzzle games, especially considering how well priced it is",Iâ€™m always looking for (good) puzzles that donâ€™t involve shooting or a time limit!! I just wish each box was a bit more involvedâ€¦.they are fairly quick to solve. On my display the light blinks ever 5 seconds or soâ€¦.is this a glitch or part of the ambience??,"As someone who adores escape rooms and puzzle games, I was thrilled to play Mystery Box! Unfortunately it does not support seated gameplay. This is a huge accessibility issue, and it's honestly shocking how it was overlooked. They have the option to stand and walk around the box, or to stand and use thumbsticks to rotate. Why there is no seated option i dont know. I'm really disappointed. When seated, the table is at chin height, making it impossible to see anything inside of drawers etc. Unfortunately because of the inaccessible nature of the game, I have to give it 1 star. If it enables seated gameplay (and i truly hope it does), I will play again and edit my review accordingly. ðŸ”¥In response to the developers replyðŸ”¥ a solution to the vertical puzzle seated issue would be to allow the player to grab and drag the 'scene' so it can be positioned below the height needed to view the puzzle. I have played many VR games that employ this feature. There is definitely pre existing design solutions you could explore.ðŸ”¥","I just started playing but find this to be a fun challenge. It reminds me of some of the boxes in The Room. The tutorial is clear, although I'm not sure how I advanced out of it, I accidentally did the right thing. Lol. You move around a box trying to sort out the puzzles to open it. I get motion sickness pretty easily, but moving around the box in this game doesn't bother me at all. I also really like the fact that if I'm stuck, I can ask for a hint. Many other games just give hints after a period of time, but I really like trying to figure it out before asking for help. If you enjoy puzzles, this one is a great one to pick up at a good price.","First off, the name leaves little to the imagination. There are (from what I can see) 10 ""mystery boxes"" in/around which you solve puzzles in order to advance and ""unlock"" the door back to the main menu or to continue onto the next box. At the point of this review, I've completed 7 of the 10 main game boxes, as I didn't want to play through it too quickly. I'm averaging about 15 minutes per box, taking on average 1 hint per puzzle. I also had help from a partner that played alongside me, so I imagine this would be a lengthier game without that help. Considering the lower price *and* now learning that new challenge content is being added *DAILY* in the form of the ""Enigmas box""... I was excited that the developers gave a daily reason to return once you complete the main game. The game does state that the puzzles will get increasingly more difficult as you advance; I'm finding minimal difficulty increases as I progress but I'm enjoying the process regardless. I enjoyed the graphics and the overall eerie feel of the soundtrack, but was also comforted in knowing that nothing was going to jump out at me. I worried what was behind that first exit door the entire tutorial, but it ended up being nothing - phew! At times it was reminiscent of some of the classic puzzlers that everybody loves to play on their phones, PCs, and VR... so it felt familiar, which was comforting. That's another worthy mention: Your first puzzle is a handheld, guided walkthrough tutorial so that you know how to use the controls. That was a very thoughtful touch as the controls weren't intuitive for me at first. My comfortable level grew quickly. Now for some constructive feedback: I love accessibility features. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could rotate around the box by using my thumbstick. The game does warn you that you have to play either in room-scale (recommended) or standing. As I play all of my games seated mostly for medical reasons, I figured I would give sitting a shot. You'd be surprised how many games can auto-adjust your height once calibrated. Unfortunately, there were moments in this game (not all, as I played seated for most of this) where I definitely needed to stand in order to see over/inside the top of the box. After finishing my gameplay, I wondered why a height-adjustment couldn't be added so that I could lower the table or raise my position. At no point did I need to be able to see under the table, so the table's leg-height seems arbitrary. I hope a height-adjustment feature is considered, because even while standing I struggled to see into the top of the box. I always set my Quest's floor height to be rather short, so that I can play games comfortably seated - so it is odd to me that I still struggled to see inside the box while standing. And although I fumbled with the controls a few times and I needed to adjust the distance of the box from my body a few times by holding down the right-Oculus button, I wouldn't call those issues with the game. I do that in most games that I play, so it might be the way I'm moving my body while seated. The biggest issues that we experienced were a few forms of what I can only call ""glitches"" that really made us question our solving-pathway. Sometimes when you would press a button to change its image, the button next to it would change as well. And there was a portion of the game where we needed to flip image-covered tiles, but they would still show the image on the ""blank"" side... so you couldn't tell if you flipped it or not. We also noticed that the buttons could be pressed from the top or the under/backside, which led to a lot of accidental double-clicking. At one point, we needed to go through the full A-Z alphabet twice just because of a double click. One of the biggest no-nos I ran into was that I received a clue for a puzzle I had not unlocked yet. I was so confused reading it but then my husband read his clue (he was playing alongside me, different headset) and he had the correct clue, thank goodness! After we unlocked the puzzle, it became clear to us what had happened once we saw the next puzzle. I didn't request another clue during that gameplay session (puzzles 1-4) out of fear that it would spoil a future puzzle for me. When I played through puzzles 5-7, I didn't experience that issue again. None of the issues we experienced would be considered dealbreakers for us, but it would be nice to see some of these refinements made. For the price and the enjoyment, we definitely recommend the game... especially if there is going to be daily content added for free. Can't argue with that!"
