It's also a wonderful workout that will undoubtedly tone your arms.,"after trying the demo I bought the game, and it's really beautiful!","This is a great game with lots of potential. I really enjoyed mission 1, but then I kept failing mission 2, to the point that it frustrated me. The difference in difficulty level between mission 1 and 2 is pretty big. Missing just ONE asteroid leads to the game ending and then you start from the beginning. This is unnecessarily frustrating. The devs really must add a ""no fail"" mode and simply allow users to see their score at the end, with the goal of improving it over time.","This is really good fun we need more levels so can't wait for them to arrive, great for a workout too defiantly going to build up the arms.",Simple experiences like this one are a good way to showcase people the power of vr!!! Keep up the good work!!!
