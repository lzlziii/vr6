The gamemodes are fantastic!!! Vehicles even better!! But the are 2 issues. Number 1 issue- getting into a game I wish we could get in at the beginning of the match instead we get put in the middle of the game. Number 2 issue- grabbing your gun out of your backpack is pretty annoying! But overall fantastic for free love the vehicles and please keep updating!!! P.S I will change review to 5 stars when bugs are fixed!!!,My left thumbstick is not working so I play on right thumbstick.,I'm excited to see where this ends up ultimately. Feels jenky but not awful,I like the game but Manet fix bugs and minor glitches but as long as they put hard work I think the game have great potential.,All I care About is that you can shoot people
