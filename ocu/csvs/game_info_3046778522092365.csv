Carroll's Riddles,"This is a paid preview to fund our further development as we visualize human knowledge in VR. Thank you for your support! In Carroll’s Riddles, you’ll play games based on Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland (1865) and The Game of Logic (1886). Carroll's Riddles is a new expression of storytelling and STEAM-based learning in an imaginary place where ideas can be visually expressive and evocative. Alice’s travels down the rabbit hole and through the looking glass are found in classic and modern stories, as subject of many a metaphor and neologism. By combining Carroll's logic with stories and art from Wonderland, we’ve expanded the context and meaning of this legend. In 1886, Lewis Carroll invented the Carroll Diagram, a tool to allow a player to visualize attributes and classifications of subjects. Confronted by interactive Carroll Diagram challenges, you solve each puzzle and gain a deeper appreciation for the underlying principles that govern this world of wonder and delight.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Documentary & History, Educational, Puzzle",English,1.51,"ScienceVR, Inc.","ScienceVR, Inc.",https://sciencevr.com/,"Apr 1, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3046778522092365/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3046778522092365&r=1, https://www.sciencevr.com/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,449.8 MB,The premise is fun but there's just not enough to it. Literally takes about 10 minutes to complete. Definitely not worth a charge for the game yet. Once it gets expanded past the one puzzle (three levels) it could be a very entertaining game.
