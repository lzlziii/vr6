It did not disappoint. The colors are great. I appreciate the fact the blocks aren't coming down so fast to where it gets frustrating trying to keep up. I have a form of Muscular Dystrophy and it gets quite frustrating finding games I can play with my hands that don't require using a bunch of the buttons on both controllers. I can play this game easily. On behalf of many, with disabilities, that struggle finding games we can actually play, a huge THANK YOU to the developer for creating this Tetrex 3D. It's relaxing and challenging at the same time. There's only 2 suggestions I can think of. I ended up muting the music because it really did start giving me a headache. I just played in silence, but it would have been nice to have diff choices. Secondly, I figured it out easy enough, but some may like to have a quick set of instructions for the controllers. Overall, I love this game and see myself spending a good bit of time playing.","I downloaded a well known Oculus tetris game and had to return it because it made me feel nauseous. I was so bummed, but then I stumbled on this game and I'm so glad I did! It's very comfortable to play. This is everything VR Tetris should be. The 3d twist is fun and brings a new element to my favorite classic. The controls are intuitive and easy to learn. All in all, I'm so glad I found this game and I would absolutely recommend it.","I like Tetris but I havenâ€™t seen it in 3D anywhere else. It was a little strange at first, but it is definitely a cool game mode. There is a learning curve to it no matter how good you are with regular Tetris so if you are up for the challenge - get the game :)",If you enjoy Tetris youâ€™ll enjoy this game. As another reviewer noted there is a small learning curve but the game picks up easily after a few minutes of play. With the 3D aspect itâ€™s like playing 4 Tetris games in 1. Once I figured out controls I found myself wanting to better my score. Replay value is there. Great game and happy I tried it!!,"Tetris is one if the games my generation played all of the time, and now here we are playing again! It moves at a pleasant speed, not so fast I can't follow. In some ways it's less stressful because if you get distracted you can turn the cube and drop a piece in the other side and continue with the side you were working on but then you have to figure that side out. Can't tell you how it ends, haven't made it that far yet ðŸ˜‰ If you like tetris, this is definitely for you."
