There's a decent amount of free content, too. Curious to see what they decide to charge for. Review of the app: visuals are hit or miss. I enjoyed a sitting stretch on the beach with plenty to look around at, but some other settings are blurry or distorted. I love the option of being able to sit on the shore's edge and meditate, or in the jungle. I desperately need a way to turn off the music, though. It's very distracting and I'd rather listen to the sounds of nature. Doesn't seem to be an option for muting music unless I'm missing it. Related to that, some customization options would be welcome here. There's a garden scene that switches between several different sites and it would be nice to be able to set a timer for how long you stay in each setting. Most meditation apps I've used provide full customization of times, colors, sounds, etc. I'm looking forward to trying out more of the stretching programs. I think that's underutilized on the quest, so I hope this is developed further. The instructors here are good and I enjoy following their direction. Overall, a pretty good start. Needs some tweaks, but can't complain much for a free app that gives me a peaceful stretch.",I tried this app for the first time this evening and I love it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the video quality. The video quality needs improvement.,"I am really enjoying this app, it is a really fun new way for mr to use VR. The locations are so cool and the instruction is great."
