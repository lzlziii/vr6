Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRQ7Xa4KqOw","Lovely 3D puzzle game think it only has 2 puzzles at the moment from what I can see, this app has real potential if they add more content and increase puzzle sizes by adding more pieces. But overall still a steal for 79p.",This should only be a demo but somehow I got charged 0.79 for just two small puzzles. If I had known I would not have purchased this and waited for it to be at least partially finished. Puzzling places is great value so donâ€™t waste your money on this!!,"Nice idea, but in my version (Meta Quest 2), there text written all over the screen, like an error. I know it's only 0,99, but I would like a refund because of defective program.","What a positive demo. Love the scenery of the volcanic cave. Potential for a level 3 which could be a 50-75 piece puzzle. I can't wait to see other dragons in the collection, and see if they interact with each other when you look at your completed puzzles collection."
