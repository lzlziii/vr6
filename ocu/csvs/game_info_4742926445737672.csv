VR Crane Simulator,"The Tower Crane places you high above the construction site, where you are tasked with lifting objects to assist in the construction of the building with various lifting objectives that require different techniques and simultaneously train you in how to operate the crane properly and avoid risks. The Overhead Crane located in a warehouse challenges you to complete obstacle courses in a timely manner with difficulties scaling for each Obstacle Course. These fun challenges will teach you above the operating of such a crane and how to carefully avoid bumping into obstacles while moving through the course. Key Features: - Realistic Overhead and Tower Crane simulations & controls - Includes Tutorials on how to operate both cranes - Physics based simulation in every situation, allowing you to knock over stuff and learn from your mistakes without danger. - Challenging Obstacle courses for both cranes challenging you to complete courses in a short amount of time!",3+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Simulation, Utility",English,1.0,Visual Engineering,Visual Engineering,https://visual-eng.com/,"Jan 21, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4742926445737672/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4742926445737672&r=1, https://visual-eng.com/privacy-policy/",474.6 MB,The bad thing about this is a Crain operative! Needs shadow to gage distance! ( shadows are missing u only need a shadow for the object and the surface not every thing) The good thing! This is so much fun to learn to operate lifting machines more please!! More details more information more interaction more vehicles/ tools. I bought construction application on my iPad/ iPhone before I started vr and I am so glad to see this on oculus learning simulation in vr is just to cool … Just please keep going add more of everything and anything and do so quickly and cheaper as lots of other people/ company’s are going on the same road.,"I am a Towercrane operator and this game is very very close to realtime!! I love the game and hope on more updates and more levels can you put the concrete bucket level where you can work with the concrete bucket, and the steal beams?????","This is a very promising simulator, and i really enjoy playing it. That being said the content in the game right now is very low, but will keep you entertained and teach you the basics.","I really welcome the attempt to provide realistic simulations for different tasks. I had been looking for a crane sim for some time out of interest, then spotted this. It is fun and captivating but at present although the controls are functional, the instructions in the tutorials would not navigate, nor were instructions given about how to move from one instruction screen to another. When I went to the tasks, I found them quite difficult and felt there should be some more gradation. I hope that the complexity of the controls improves, as half the fun of a sim is discovering what the real version might be like to drive. I found the pointer (cursor) did not navigate the instructions screens. Nor were their clear signs when I had completed a training program successfully. I realise this is limited by the available buttons on the hand controllers but maybe some touch screen operationality would make the sim more varied in future updates. Also it was not clear to me in the outside crane training exercise, what to do after I had crashed the crate I was trying to pick up and how to restart. Keep going developers. This is an important function for VR to help us sim other experiences and professions. I hope to see updates soon. 4 stars with one of them as encouragement :)"
