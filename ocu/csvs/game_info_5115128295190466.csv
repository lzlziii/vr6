Enjoy beautiful scenery and relaxing sounds! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl2lFxymD20,Beautiful fish and relaxing!,"This game is definitely not the most polished game you will find on App Lab. But it is simple, and a lot of fun for younger kids who love to cruise around the different underwater environments collecting different sea creatures. I wouldn't necessarily consider it an educational game, since there are a few issues in size and animal selection. (A hippo walking around the ocean floor for example) I also wish there was a better way to examine the animal models without them disappearing when you get to close and ""collect"" them.",As a game it is a little limited at the moment but it's actually just a wonderful way to relax swimming around finding an impressive amount of undersea life that you can get close to and collect. I honestly found myself just floating around in this cool underwater world more than trying to get any high score. Great way to relax :),"Kudos to the developer for this one - it made me smile from ear-to-ear. It's very much like a colorful dreamscape that I lost myself in for quite a few minutes. The fish don't move (they are animated but remain stationary) but that didn't detract from the overall experience. I did genuinely laugh out loud when I saw a hippo and the developers face on a fish! I wish you every success with your future projects - thank you for this, it was fun!"
