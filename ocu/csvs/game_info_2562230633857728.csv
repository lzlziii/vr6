Paranormal Activity: The Lost Soul,"Armed with a battery hungry flashlight, you find yourself exploring what appears to be a quiet average looking home in a woodsy neighborhood. Before long, you discover youâ€™re not alone as you discover the clues unraveling the horrifying mystery of whatâ€™s gone on in this house and struggle to survive the terror that hunts you. For an even more terrifying experience, switch to the highly popular VR Mode which immerses you in the environment using minimum Room Scale combined with our Immersive Movement Role-play System (IMRS). After the tutorial, you're on your own. Zero onscreen directions or HUD in your face, youâ€™re never taken out of the immersion.",18+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Horror",English,1.2,VRWERX,VRWERX,https://www.pavrgame.com/,"Sep 9, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2562230633857728/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2562230633857728&r=1, https://www.pavrgame.com/terms-of-use",Terms of Service,2.97 GB,"I have played the game now for roughly 3 days after work and I launched it today and have had nothing but issues! ðŸ˜” it glitches out really bad, the floor level isnâ€™t synced with the meta menus level. Iâ€™m either in the rafters of the ceiling or it looks like Iâ€™m crawling on the floor. Current level I just found the room behind the fireplace and any time I go in the room it will glitch me back on the other side of the door, coins will disappear OR it will glitch me into the corner where the old stair case is and I canâ€™t move at all to where Iâ€™ll have to restart. it will load to where Iâ€™m standing outside the house and ironically hitch me back to standing in front of the fireplace. If I knew this game would cause this much issue I never would have payed for it ðŸ˜”","Great game, loved it, great jump scares, hysterical if you like that kind of thing. Many reviews have said about glitches in game so i can understand people been sceptical, i was, but honestly i found none, it ran smoothly from beginning to end, not sure if its down to the internet or the game but nope, mine played through brilliant. Only one problem, its just not long enough, i wish it had been longer, i have played it through a few times now, looking for thing i may have missed, dont think there is anything else i could possibly find now, hey ho. I would personally still highly recommend this game.",Its a great gamebut the fact it's not always clear what to do kinda leaves alot of walking around and trying door good jump scares though,Shocking game. Not scary at all quite a mind numbing game. Crazy glitchy to the point you can be upstairs then it teleports you elsewhere in or out the house. Its a pain in the A***. Tried to request refund and was denied so please don't waste money on this game ðŸ˜¢,This game have a glitch as you get further in the gam it start having glitches.
