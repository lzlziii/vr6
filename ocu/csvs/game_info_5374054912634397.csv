I would just appreciate if there would come out a new beta with my updated map (the one with the beach). I really hope this happens and I hope that the new revamped comes out soon.,Ok so I have been playing for a while and I think this game needs more improvement. I give this 5 stars. here are some ideas. 1. Mod Menu. 2. Mirror and more cosmetics. 3. Limited time cosmetics. 4. More colors. 5. Private lobbies and leaderboard. 6. Game modes. 7. More maps. 8. Music. 9. Update the look of the platypus. 10. Update the computer a bit. That's it. Have a nice day creator! Also forgot to mention you spent a lotta hard work and I think you did great!,"im in the discord, and im a admin for this game. in my opinion, this game is very well made. the cosmetics, the maps, the collabs, the fun, it all just fits well together. great job to wyxtt and the others that worked to make this game what it is today. -cc",It has a amazing creator With 4 maps that you can check out￼￼ and the water park is under construction but it’s still probably the best slide that you can find on app lab over all my favorite game￼,I made it and hope u enjoy
