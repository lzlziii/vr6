Finger Gun,"Finger Gun: It’s exactly what it sounds like. Use your hands in the shape of guns (no touch controllers required!) and immerse yourself in childhood fantasy as you shoot, grapple, and survive an onslaught of dangerous robots on your quest to capture Doc Holliday and claim his epic bounty. Use powerful morph modules to unlock your full potential, plus an upgrade system ensures you have a unique journey every time you play. Purpose-built from the ground up, Finger Gun provides a streamlined hand-tracking showcase experience by putting players hands-first into the action from the very start.

I will say, I’ve never been a fan of using hand gestures because it never works flawlessly. Controllers are far more precise compared to the current hand tech. I’ve tried the air guitar game and that was beyond unplayable. However, this game does what little it does pretty well. It feels like 90% of my gestures are captured right now… if you could raise it to 100%, then I’d say you made VR history. Long story short, as long as the developers continue updating and perfecting this game, then it’s a no brainer purchase. Finger gun is far and away the best hand tracking I’ve experienced. I give this a solid 8/10, with room to be 10/10 in the future.","Update: Just uupdated the game, and wow, it feels even better now. the 180 and 360 options make the game more dificult, and more fun! Handtracking performance is great as well, and loved all new enemies and weapons (specially the glove). It feels now more balanced in terms of difficulty, and gained a lot of playability on top of what the game previous offered. Really much in love with this game, guys! Need to try! Old review: All I have to say about this game is that it brings me a lot of hours of fun. It´s one of those games that you can play over and over and keeps you wanting more!. Reached level 10 (1st boss) already, and I´m really eager to play again to kill that m****f**** XD The mechanics are amazing, it´s awesome to see how the game takes advantage of what you may thought is a crappy tech like Hand Tracking. I played Hand Physics Lab couple of times before buying Finger Gun and though HandTracking was totally useless, but no! Actually, it´s really fun and as far as you have a good light in the room, this title works flawless. Of course playing gets you tired and you sometimes fail with the right gestures, but hey, that´s part of the fun on this game. you need to keep a good posture and kill all the swarms. Old School. Another aspect I love from this game is that you don´t need 4 hours to play. You can just connect your headset for 30 minutes and have some fun before dinner. Definitely, a game I´d recommend.","For some reason all of the mechanics are super fun - it just makes me smile how you shoot your finger guns, slot an upgrade into your arm and then shoot some more! It’s all just so satisfying :) What i like the most is probably the fact, that you can shoot the guns by hitting your middle finger with your thumb - it just adds a really nice haptic feedback, that is often missing in games with hand tracking - good job devs, really clever! I hope that there will be more content and hopefully the game will also arive on the official store - it deserves it!",Work,"This game really pushes the limits of what hand tracking games can be, I think this can get really competitive once people get used to it. Hand tracking makes the mechanics surprisingly intuitive and easy to get anyone into it (my almost 60 y/o mom had a blast), but I really recommend resting a bit between your first runs to prevent your fingers from getting tired (in my experience, this goes away after playing a few times once your fingers get used to it). Aside from that, the game is quite polished and the art style looks great, and the game has an upgrade system and multiple weapons to keep things different and interesting. As an early adopter (CV1), this is a very interesting progression for the technology and makes me exited for where developers will go as the tech improves."
