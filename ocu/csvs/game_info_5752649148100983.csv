You can make it more intense, set workouts, all kinds of customizations. The developer is constanly working on the game so more to come but worth checking out for a variety in your VR workout at a bargain price.","I own almost every audio box/rhythm game. But this one is still very unpolished related to customization, physics/mechanics/hit/dodge ergonomy, rhythm, songs, beatmaps, SFX.. Often I get stuck on ""Loading..."" message to have to restart the game. Song preview is too short to evaluate one for later use.. Custom MP3s would be better than low quality 3rd party beatmaps..","Love this game. The idea of jabbing and hooking in time with the notes of your songs is great fun and can be a tough workout. And no subscription, thank goodness. It's like Beat Saber, but much more fitness focused, which I appreciate. To me, it is perfect hand in hand with TOTF as an exercise routine. I also really appreciate the mode ""leg day"" so you can really work on your lower half. I often have to wipe down my headset playing, and it definitely gets your heart rate pumping. That being said, there are two issues I've run into, and I do have a suggestion to further improve the gameplay: - The walls: There have been times where I've ducked in time to avoid walls, but it doesn't seem to register and my combo breaks. Not sure if I'm too slow to duck but it often feels like I'm not. On a side note, I think it would really help if the walls were transparent so you can see the upcoming blocks behind, like in Beat Saber. There's been a few times where I missed a note after ducking as the walls block your view. - When it comes to hooks and uppercuts, sometimes, it doesn't register my hits. I was wondering if this is because I'm not using enough force? Or is timing just needed? I'm able to hit the jabs just fine, however. Apart from that, I'm really happy with the rest of game and what you've got going so far. It is definitely a good fitness companion, and it's up there with other games like TOTF and Les Mills BC that get you drenched in sweat! Edit: Just updating this review after the helpful response from the Dev and having a session from last night. After the recent update, tracking has indeed improved alot! I'm able to hit the hooks more fluidly. And I really do like the new feature with the walls where it makes the screen flash if you did hit one. It really encourages you to dodge a lot more quicker. Thanks! I also just wanted to add that one of the features I like about this app that most other fitness apps lack is the ability to make your workout playlist. Loading a playlist with my favourite gorillaz songs that usually last up to 20 mins + songs on hard or expert mode + leg day enabled = Fighting for your life while jamming to songs you love! Perfect combination! As always, I was completely wiped out after last night's session, and I'm looking forward to the next one! Thanks for the updates and continuous hard work.","I've not played much of it yet but from what I have played it seems good. Just a question though - does it support mp3 files you add yourself or does it specifically need to be Beat Saber maps? I've added mp3s to files/Resources/Songs but they are not showing. Will not be requesting refund regardless cause I really like layout and from reading reviews, the developer seems really responsive and is willing to listen to customers - and no paywall surprises! Very interested in seeing the progression. Keep up the amazing work!","I rotate between several work out apps including Les Mills body combat, through of the fight, moonrider which is a beat saber like clone and this app. I have been using this app since January and it is by far my favorite app to work out to and the one I spend the most time on Here's why: one. The app combines getting into a rhythmic flow like beat saber but throwing punches which I feel gives a better and more practical workout and works out more muscles than swinging imaginary swords like in beat saber. The latest version of the app lets you select which side targets come from including mixing where the targets for the right hand and the target for the left hand will come from which is the setting I use and to me up the aerobic intensity of even the beginner workout because you constantly have to adjust to where the targets are coming from. The icing on the cake is that the app can use custom songs. You can load into it custom songs that have been craved for beat saber which you can find and download from online or use online beat saber custom song packs of any song you have that you that there is not already a pack for. I have created song packs of songs from Dream Theater Lynyrd Skynyrd Tom Petty Jeremy Camp Saxon and many others. There is nothing like a beat saber like throwing punches while singing along to the anthemic course Hell Yeah by American Hi-Fi. I find that I can work out much longer when I am able to work out to songs that I am familiar with and get me pumped up. There are also many customization options, so many that I have barely explored more than 10% of the options. The one I use the most is the height setting to make sure the targets are set at the correct height and sometimes I increase my height a little or lower my high a little which causes the targets to come in a little higher than normal or a little lower than normal forcing me to adjust my punches which I feel helps work out additional muscles. And some, this app is a bargain at the current price. If you are looking for your first Exercise app, I would encourage you to try this one because of how accessible it is at a very low price compared to other fitness apps. If you are out of shape like I am I would recommend starting with this app instead I'm thrill all the fight, which is also deservantly a highly rated and praised app, just that if you are out of shape it is tough to last more than a round or two on that app while this app allows you to start hitting 20 30 45 even up to an hour workouts at beginner level and then keep up in the intensity as you need. Lastly I forgot to mention how great the developer is. I have exchanged numerous messages with the developer with suggestions of improvements to the app and there have been at least four if not five updates since January when I first purchased the app and the current update really raises the experience on the app to a whole new level that makes the app almost unrecognizable to where it was in January and I still enjoyed the app very much in January. I love seeing the developer being so responsive and showing that he really cares about users getting a great experience from the app. with the bonus of filling of knowing that my money. For the price and what it offers the app was already a five to me so it is an extra A+ bonus to know that my money is also a good developer."
