Uninstalled immediately as some of the enemies (they're not all laser emitters) look almost invisible and a single hit from anything kills you, forcing you to restart an entire level. Why they didn't put in multiple lives, or give you more reaction time to see enemies to actually enjoy the scenery is beyond me. Some enemies spawn, or are intentionally positioned against you, with less than 2 seconds to shoot them when you're already busy trying to take down others. Wait for significant updates before trying this one."
