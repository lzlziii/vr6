Buy it immediately.,"Had great fun playing, jumping between playing pinball in VR and then scaling down and being IN the pinball machine. Awesome!","This game's soundtrack is pumping dudes and since the introduction of the cats pinball machine and backgrounds, has taken this game to off the hook. The addictiveness of achieving all the parts needed to get to the next level without missing is amazing. and not an easy feat I may add. I have poured hours into this game and it's full on. See your name in the leaderboards and work your way up them. Pick a song then try to hit that skill shot. What a feeling of triumph right there ! The feeling of just one more try is always there and has you on edge as you mutter to yourself I can do this I highly recommend this game to fans of heavy metal music and if you like a challenge that ties in well with pinball. Don't worry if you mess up just try try again! This game is so much fun. Don't miss this one folks a rythmic game that brings the glory with added KICK.",my favorite game of 2022 and more years the best rock and heavy metal game to play,"If you like heavy metal music and a fun, frantic, immersive pinball game then this is perfect."
