Other than that I think this stunning casual puzzler is perfect.",Nothing makes me happier than coming home from a long night of work than to wind down and this does it! Vibrant colors that don't hurt the eyes and soft sounds that are pleasing to listen to. Not to mention being able to solve the puzzles however you please.,"I enjoy this game its fun and any age can do it. The only frustration I have with it is when you try to adjust a piece and you let it go and pick it back up again, when you pick it back up it defaults to an angle that it wasnt in before. So you might have almost had it right and then when you try to get it JUST right you gotta start from scratch again with the new angle. Hope this helps!",Great concept and cute atmosphere <3,Oddly satisfying indeed. I just love great free softwareðŸ˜Šmakes me happy.
