Medicalholodeck's Dissection Master XR,"Dissection Master XR is the human anatomy lab in virtual reality. The app brings 3D data of high-resolution human dissections to VR. The data is created especially for anatomy teaching on a university level. The entire human body has been carefully dissected and digitized in 10 high-resolution layers. All structures relevant for anatomical education on a university level are precisely marked and annotated. Dissection Master XR brings human dissections of the highest quality to VR and makes them interactively accessible for medical teaching and education. The entire human body can be studied in multiple layers and discussed in groups in VR. The app is the perfect complement to traditional face-to-face lessons in the anatomy and dissection lab. Dissection Master XR allows teaching in VR. Digital classrooms are created at the touch of a button, and students can participate in location-independent lessons.",12+,"Multiplayer, Single User, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Educational, Medicine, Productivity",English,"0.10.0
