But I think you should add a feature so that in puzzle mode once you finish a level it automatically starts the next one until it gets to the last level you completed. I’m not sure if you already have this feature and I just haven’t found it,but if not you should totally do that.","This game is a really fun game. The reason is that the operation method is so simple and easy. And I think even those who are new to VR will be able to enjoy it. However, the reason why this game is fun is that anyone can enjoy the puzzle difficulty of this game, and it was so much fun because various conditions and objects appeared. And when you're done solving the puzzles, it's so nice and fun to enjoy puzzles made by people online or to see dominoes made by people. And in the sandbox mode, you can make your own dominoes, so I used my creativity for the first time in a while. I would rate this game 100 out of 10.",I would highly recommend this game. It will keep you busy for some time and it's very satisfying. I also love that there is a sandbox mode to build whatever your imagination desires.,"No cleaning up to do, any mistakes are easily fixed with a click of a button. Plenty of room to place your ramps, dominos and things. Great tutorial. Found getting used to the controls no problem at all. Love big apartment that’s in the game. Just able to do all the stuff I wanted to do as a kid (plus more). Absolute must have for such a small price. Strawbooby says YES Ooooh wee!","It's nice to be able to chill and solve puzzles. The atmosphere they've set up is relaxing. The music is super chill. Just recently finished all the puzzles and felt this game deserves the recognition. This and Walkabout Mini-golf are my go-to games for relaxing and having fun. I will add, another review talked about not having steady hands and offered a grid or rail snap solution. I second this. A grid/snap option that you could easily toggle on/off either button-mapped or as a button in the build menu would be a nice addition. Alternatively, I think having an option to smooth the controller positioning input would be a good addition as well."
