I bought it when it first came to quest and gave it 5 stars. I wish I could change it to 100 stars. I live in the middle of nowhere and have no friends IRL. Every other game base is too toxic to really make friends. Not Alvo! The community (which the devs are VERY active in) has become my entire social life. All us seasoned veterans are happy to help new players. When you buy Alvo, you're not just buying a game. You're buying a family! Community aside, this is STILL the best VR shooter EVER. It's the closest you'll get to COD. The controls are a bit strange at first, but it's VERY accessible for those with disabilities or coming to VR from flat screen. Devs are CONSTANTLY updating the game and adding new features, maps, guns, etc. We even have a team based league now. Not only is this game worth every penny, but it actually SAVES you $ because you'll never want to buy another game again!","I've been playing for over a year now, and I have to say I have never experienced a game like alvo, fast paced with kill streaks, perks etc ðŸ¤© team modes and Zombies ðŸ”¥ amazing community with people who genuinely want to help new people get into the game ðŸ’¯ The devs are working non stop to provide us with kore guns, skins, maps and constant updates to improve the game ðŸ”¥ I have the honour of testing on both quest and Psvr2 and all I can say with the quest 3 out soon there are amazing things to come for alvo ðŸ’¯ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ a must buy for me on any platform you won't regret it. Best advice, ask advice whenever you can and build up your skills ðŸ”¥ hope to see you on the field ðŸ¤©ðŸ”¥","Been playing this game from the start of beta for psvr1 release.

Game okay is on point, exciting and always something new to discover around the corner. The main reason we purchased 2 oculus ... Just to play some alvo. The online community is one of the best gaming online communities in existence. The creater/owner and the entire team that works with him running this game are awesome people and treat thier players like truly valued assets. I recommend alvo to ANYONE who has VR system. Never ever had any issues with anything being hacked or messed with. Its safe secure and consistent. Way to go with the wholesomeness of this game!!! LOVE IT!",. Itâ€™s Always a good a time . The privacy settings allow for becoming more familiar with maps and equipment perks and getting better at placing those groupings where you want them to go . Very pleasant and comfortable to play sitting or standing
