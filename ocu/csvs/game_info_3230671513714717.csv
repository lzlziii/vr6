I recently downloaded your game, and I must say it's fantastic. However, I'm facing an issue where the game stops working after a few minutes of gameplay. It's quite disappointing as I was really enjoying it. I would greatly appreciate it if you could look into this matter and resolve the problem. I'm eager to continue playing the game, and I'm even willing to repurchase it if necessary. Please contact me as soon as the issue is resolved. I'm eagerly waiting for your response. Thank you for your attention and assistance. Best regards,","I enjoyed each level but once completed you sort of hit a wall with the repetitive gameplay of cooking the same things. The only challenge is you just have to do everything faster. Fun for a bit but the simple graphics and basic recipes get a little old after awhile. Also I don’t understand why there is only one ladle for tomato and cheese sauce? I find it kinda boring swapping between them. I’d also love it if there was actual skill assessment, like flipping pancakes, or some sort of technique to explore.","I loooooove this game. I brought the Oculus just to play this game every day. However, I seem to have been having issues with Clash Chef these last few days where it freezes/stop. It's been very disappointing lately because I havent been able to play. I read someone else is having a similar issue... I hope hope it's resolved soon before uninstalled to find another game similar. .","I love, love, love this game!!! One of my favorites! I've beat all the modes except Mexican due to it not registering the orders correctly (for example, if someone wants beef, it'll say I put chicken meaning I got the order wrong)...however, I'm making the orders as shown - it's the game itself not giving credit for the right order made. I know it's something with this mode only, because the other ones work perfectly fine. Was hoping there would've been some kind of update by now possibly addressing/fixing that issue - but no updates as of yet. But other than that one flaw: THIS GAME ROCKS HARD!!!",Game is fun but is now unplayable after the most recent update. We deleted and reinstalled it but still the same problem. The graphics turn black before I am able to complete the first order. Please fix!!!
