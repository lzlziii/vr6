Vault of Stars - Early Access,"The living constellations of the Guardians have long served as a shield against the emptiness and entropy of the Void. But the Void’s corruption has seeped into the Vault of Stars, drawn by the evils of humanity, encouraged by the Voidbringer. The stars have fallen to the Island of Souls, shattering the World Tree and plunging the world into darkness. The constellations have risen again as unholy shadows. Now the Void is ascendant, threatening to doom all of creation - and only you, the Last Star, can choose: Will you bring new life to the World Tree or let its light fade forever?

And give a through hits on the reply tuogh bits . .I love to give the game 5 stars .but carnt stay in long enough to finish the game without a save .,Looks like it might be a good game but it just doesn’t work,"I love the control system in this game and there are too many cool things about it. I know it's early, but I hope you get the support needed.","I was hooked the instant the flight controls were explained at the start of the game. VR was made for experiences like this. Visually it’s stunning to look at. The cinematic story opening pulls you in right away and sets the tone for the rest of the journey. The music is appropriately atmospheric. I loved this. If I had to lodge one complaint, there’s zero haptic feedback in the controllers and there’s bo “wind shear” sound, so the flying felt more like operating in zero gravity than soaring through the air. This is a minor thing though. I’m definitely looking forward to more.",This game is absolutely majestic. The feeling of flying is incredible and smooth. The puzzles are nice. The environment and story are Miyazaki-esque (or Ori-esque if we are to stick with video games) and very promising. Is there an estimated date of full release? This could be an absolute winner.
