Zombied VR,"Zombied VR is a free to play zombie shooter, which is round based, you get money by killing zombies, get new weapons and magazines, to keep on killing the zombies!",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Shooter",English,1.0.4,NielsieDev,Niels Cremers,https://nielsiecremers.nl/,"Jan 22, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5573614662718449/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5573614662718449&r=1, https://nielsiecremers.nl/privacypolicy.html",756.4 MB,I mean I like the way they added ragdoll physics but it seems kind of basic and pale but overall it's a okay game if you're going to play this game on your free time it's funny how the zombies look like they're straight from a website if you know what I mean AKA downloaded model but it's okay so if you're willing to play this game go ahead no one stopping you just be warned that's kind of a small project so don't think too much of it that's all I have to say.,Not to bad but the controls are really clumsy and reaching for gun platforms puts you on top of the so you canâ€™t reach the ammo or guns.
