Flow Weaver,"You are trapped. Bound by magic by unknown captors. But you are a Flow Weaver and can move between dimensions. Travel amongst them, learn new spells, and uncover the secrets of this strange world to orchestrate your escape. Flow Weaver is a narrative escape room game. The player explores and experiments with their environment, moving between different magical dimensions to solve intuitive puzzles towards the goal of escape. Gameplay allows you to move between your cell and multiple different dimensions (or ""Flows"") as you discover them, learning how each Flow affects the world in different ways. The player uses those differences to solve puzzles and challenges, learn new skills or spells, and uncover new objects and new puzzles. Flow Weaver is an immersive seated experience with fully voiced dialogue, a moving soundtrack, and rich narrative lore for fantasy fans to dig into.",7+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Interactive Story, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), French (Canada), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Venezuela)",2.1,Stitch Media and Silverstring Media,Self-published,https://flow-weaver.com/,"Mar 11, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3433698816645881/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3433698816645881&r=1, https://www.gamesbystitch.com/flow-weaver/privacy",1.68 GB,"I love puzzle games and this one was really fun to do! The different worlds are gorgeous to look at and the interactions aren't too bad. I was able to play sitting, which was really nice to do.","I started playing this game cause I love puzzle games, and the storyline is interesting. I was almost done with the game but found a glitch that restarting the game from the beginning didn't solve. The glitch is with the gears in the underworld. I put them in the right spot and I burned the ropes off but the gear right under the big gear is not moving. How do I solve this problem? I want to finish the game! In response to developer: I am unable to move the gear once placed, I have tried multiple times. I have gone as far as restarting the whole game and even uninstalling and reinstalling the game.","This is an interesting game to play. It let’s you work things out yourself. Sometimes the next step is easy, sometimes it has you stumped for a while. Move between worlds to collect the things you need. It would be better if it was a multiplayer game, within the same game. I play it with someone else who has the same game. In Options, turn the dialogue and music down enough to hear each other in party chat. That way, you’re walking through the game together. More fun, in my opinion. But definitely fun to play by yourself.",This game was not great. I wish I could have completed it but it has too many bugs and sticking points where I've had to start over from the beginning twice and still can't get to the final part of the game. In addition there is no hint or clue system to aid you. For some puzzles it is fine but there are some serious flaws you would never figure out without looking up walk-throughs. Even then the bugs can keep you from completing them and progressing the game.,"It was a fun game, I'm glad I got it! Had some parts that were easy and others that were difficult and really stomped me. The only thing I didn't like was that the game was short and I wish they had more worlds."
