Where?!","I like what I‚Äôve played sofar in this game. I‚Äôve only gotten to room 75 so I haven‚Äôt had much encounters with the ghost, but it definitely got my blood pumping. I normally have a difficult time playing vr horror games like fnaf help wanted, but this definitely is spooky but not terrifying and it‚Äôs a lot of fun. It reminds me a bit of spookys haunted mansion. I think it was worth the 5$. I am also impressed about the lore of the game. Good job devs! üëç",Great spooky atmosphere and excellent artwork. Rather relaxing until you start getting chased by ghosts. Please consider adding a smooth turning option. Would be also great if it had animated sliding doors.
