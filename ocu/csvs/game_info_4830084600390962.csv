They don't even Understand basic arithmetic let alone the Work that needs to be put into developing a game with such little resources at hand, hell they are almost there, they can't even learn, always yelling ""How!?"" ""hacking"" ""Aim bot"". Yet they don't even understand solutions for the ""How"" and they think they can write a review? Please disregard. The game has potential for sure. Some QoL UI adjustments need to happen and simplicity needs to be front and center when it comes To the handling and controls, little too complex and will be a deciding factor if not placed as a priority.. All in all it's not a bad concept and I look forward to seeing it grow.",Don’t trust reviews or videos showing game play. Try to view characters and it sends me off my headset. When I go to play a game it just spins. Updates and reviews are false. Don’t waste your time downloading.,"So I've been playing this game for a few weeks now, and I have been enjoying it so much! I've been lucky to talk to the creators of the game a few times and they are amazing and are super devoted to making there game as much fun as possible. This game is still in pre alpha, and the fact that it's this good is just crazy!",Have just spent a while playing this and I'm frankly quite impressed even though it's in the alpha stage i think that I will keep coming back to this to check out the updates or changes that the developers add it's a massive map which I like aswell this game has alot of promise !
