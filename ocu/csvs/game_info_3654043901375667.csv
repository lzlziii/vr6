The controls are super intuitive, which I love. You can make your playfield just as you wish, so if you want your blocks on your right you can do that, which makes playing much easier. The music is very retro and together with the looks of the game that gives a great asthetic. This game is my go to when I want to sit down and play for a while or when I want to go to sleep but just play a short nice game. Definitely recommend! This is a steal for just 5 bucks. The dev said there is a vetrix 2 coming so i'm looking forward to that. Thanks dev!"
