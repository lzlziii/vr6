I want to give this a better rating I just would like to progress LOL. Wow thank you for such a fast response. I'm excited as hell to try it again now so keep up the good work. Edit: Easily the quickest fix I've ever seen in a virtual reality game. This developer really is on top of things. Thank you,"So far Iâ€™ve had a blast I played the first few levels. I like the companion you get it makes this game stand out and be unique. The game has few flaws and of those flaws they are very minor and barely affect gameplay. I would recommend to give this game a shot. Thereâ€™s not many stealth games in VR and this is one of my favorites, if not my favorite.","Task force 9 is a genuinely well rounded game, definitely better than most CQBâ€™s. I really like the idea of an ai partner you can guide around the map to complete your objective because In most multiplayer games you can hardly find any players that are cooperative enough to do so, but i do suppose it is all about having fun. But the best part about this game is that its a completely free demo. I cant wait to see what this becomes in the future but i can guess it is going to be great seeing how good the demo is. It does have many bugs and glitches but not any that are bad enough to make you stop enjoying the game. The only issue i do have is with the left handed mode, when i turned it on and got into the level the gun on my waist was facing the right way but the mag was still on the left, it isnt a gamebreaking bug but it does get a bit annoying. If the dev could make a discord server for suggestions, bug reports or just general chat that would be great.","The only game that could compete, at least that I know of(I don't have money for other similar games) is Pavlov. The concept is amazing, mil-sim strategy shooter? Yessir! I can't wait for the full version to come out. Only thing is it's hard to put the gun back where it goes. It just falls and respawns back on my chest. It's so hard to find games that you can reload by grabbing a mag from your side, and reloading it. Pop-1, it's free now, but for a $20 game, it should have reloaded better. I spent $40 on Arizona Sunshine, and the reload is drop mag, and put it close to your chest. Somehow it magically just reloads. So this is definitely a rare treat. Isn't this free? Just download it and delete it later if you really don't like it. Note for dev: difficulty putting the gun back is kinda annoying, and I think it'd be great to fix that. I don't actually own anything like a PC or laptop, so I don't know anything about developing games. But I could give recommendations for I feel would be better features to try and add.",It needs to be multiplayer and way more updates to the game ðŸ«¶ and more details and graphics
