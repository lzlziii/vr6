My initial review was that the it was impossible to avoid the glass walls, you actually need to punch them! It's alot of fun. Some feedback. 1. There is some.slowdown/slow framerate on the game especially when hitting the walls. 2. Make it so you need to hit the targets not just stick your arms out much better for a workout! Give more points for hitting targets but also space them out so you can hit them. Lovely background as well! Keep up the great work!!","I really hope you enjoy the game if you need any help or wanna provide feedback, join me on Discord: https://discord.gg/MEcbBRAfNk Thanks ^_^"
