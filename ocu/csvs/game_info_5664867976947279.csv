Scamper,"You Are A Rat. Enter into a dark and complex sewer system where another rat is lost. Your mission is to find this lost rat and help it escape. You Are Not Alone. Something lurks in the shadows of the sewer system, and it is always on the hunt for rats. You can scamper, climb, and leap through the environment with just the movement of your hands and arms. You will need to move fast and figure out how to get around the vast sewer system. You‚Äôll need to use clever tactics to guide the lost rat, as it will react to your movements and actions. Will it follow your lead, or will it run away out of fear? It‚Äôs all up to you. It is time to enter the sewer.",12+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Horror, Strategy",English,9,Bezbro Games,Bezbro Games,https://bezbrogames.com/,"Jul 28, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5664867976947279/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5664867976947279&r=1, https://www.termsfeed.com/live/1b7bff2b-076c-44a2-b462-db150a651fff",315.2 MB,"I would highly recommend this game if you are experienced in gorilla tag locomotion style games and want a spooky and thrilling experience. You should definitely have at least some experience in gtag locomotion as this game gives no tutorial on how to move. As for the horror aspect, I would say I have a pretty good horror tolerance and yet scamper still gave me the chills. The lack of information is actually a good thing for scamper as it leaves you wondering what is with you and further drives the horror experience. The ""thing"" in there with you is not all that unnerving on his own, however when you are looking for your fellow rat and have gone far without issue until he rushes from the darkness. The panic is perfect. The scariest aspect is (in my opinion) the lights that click on when you enter a room, the slight delay leaving you for a brief moment in the darkness. The graphics are decent, they aren't perfect but I can tell they are stylised and the game is immersive enough so that you don't notice. Also one dude with little funding made it. I should also mention that bezbro games is a very reliable dev and will try to resolve any issues with the game you may have. Overall I would have to give scamper a solid 8/10 and is definitely worth the price.",This game is one of if not the best VR horror games. The atmosphere the sounds the movement it‚Äôs all perfect. The rat eater is absolutely terrifying when you see him especially when he‚Äôs in the dark. 5/5 more people need to try this.,This game is amazing but it's way to scary for me by myself... sooooo I'd say add a multiplayer so I'll be forced to go with the other rats üêÄ,"Played for the first time with some friends and had a blast trying to navigate the sewer, and the monster is straight from hell",Buy it already.
