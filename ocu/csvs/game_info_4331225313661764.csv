Fingers were tired from pressing the continuous shooting button and waving the controller around. I love the instantaneous movement of the airplane that made me feel like a kid zooming my plane around and ducking the slow moving bullets coming towards me. Great game. Only played one level and because of it was so long I was sweating and tired by the end of it; had to go take a nap afterwards (just kidding) but the level was long and repetitive. Perhaps there might be some variations in the next levels but I only play one level to get the gist of the game and I write a full review based on the first 30 minutes of playing which is one level. I'll still give it a 5 for a great concept of a game and the zooming of the hand held plane. Might get around to playing another level someday... but for now... too tired.","I was in two minds weather to get this but I'm glad I did, great gameplay very smooth, really got that just one more go to improve score vibe.",So much Retro Feeling in this Game. I love it. Great work Developers ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’ª,"How are there only 39 ratings for this game? Thatâ€™s criminal. This game was made with genuine TLC. I was looking for a Raiden VR type game and this is it, IN SPADES.",Simple but fun. Especially in the later levels. I wasnâ€™t that excited about the blocky world war visuals but the game mechanic was very enjoyable. Looking forward to trying the harder difficulty settings and co-op.
