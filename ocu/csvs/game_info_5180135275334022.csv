VRkanoid,"In this game you have the opportunity to swing your racket to your heart's content, hit the ball with all your might, and smash the tiles on the walls to pieces. Modest but pleasant graphics in a futuristic style are waiting for you. And you will definitely like the physics of interaction between rackets and balls! When you destroy a brick, you have a chance to knock some bonus out of it. For example: - extra ball - a protective field that will not allow you to lose the ball - changed direction of gravity (you will never see this in real life) - turning your ball into a fireball - time dilation (slowmo) For a variety of play, you can change the appearance of your ball and rackets. You will experience very different sensations when playing with different racquets. This is not just a change in visual appearance, but a change in the gaming experience.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Sports","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Spain), Ukrainian",1.2,Martysh Dev,Martysh Dev,https://sites.google.com/view/vrkanoid,"Mar 15, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5180135275334022/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5180135275334022&r=1, https://sites.google.com/view/vrkanoid/privacy-policy?authuser=0",182.9 MB,"I'm a sucker for bat'n'ball games on the Oculus, with Racket: NX being one of my all-time favourite games on any system. So whenever a new bat'n'ball game comes out I'm usually all over it. I held off on this one due to its initial price. This popped up on a website I keep an eye on, listing Quest price reductions. It also allows you to trial the game. I played the trial and was entertained enough to purchase the game. What I will say is that there's a lot of potential here. The ball mechanics are pretty good and better than a lot of similar games on the Oculus. The powerups are inventive, but would like to see more added. There doesn't seem to be too many levels available unless more appears once I clear the ones I can currently see. Some early levels seemed pointless and a big waste of a level in my opinion. Music and FX are pretty basic. I would like to hear better, meatier sound FX. The vibration when the bat hits the ball needs to be turned up a bit too. There's no lasting appeal to any game like this without Leaderboards and this game desperately needs leaderboards. I like the idea of the perks and that does urge me to play more to see what other perks are available. So much needs to be improved, and doing so could make this game very playable indeed. At Â£3.99 I would say that price is about right, but with updates, more content, leaderboards etc this could be worth a higher asking price."
