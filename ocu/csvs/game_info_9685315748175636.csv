Join the discord too! https://discord.gg/gjSXNtBHqq","Battleglide takes the exhilaration of VR gaming to new heights, delivering an incredibly immersive experience that combines the sheer joy of spiderman-style webswinging with intense gunplay and satisfying melee combat. Set against the backdrop of a meticulously crafted cityscape, this game succeeds in blending diverse gameplay elements into a seamless and captivating adventure. Graphics and Immersive Cityscape: The visual fidelity of Battleglide is nothing short of remarkable. The city you swing through is a sprawling masterpiece, boasting stunning architecture, bustling streets, and vibrant details that truly transport players into its world. Webswinging Mechanics: The core of the game's appeal lies in its webswinging mechanics, heavily reminiscent of Spider-Man. Battleglide nails this aspect, allowing players to elegantly glide through the city using wrist-mounted web-shooters. The physics-based swinging feels natural and exhilarating while also including a bit of a skill gap, it offers genuine sense of freedom and control as you traverse between skyscrapers and navigate urban landscapes. Gunplay and Melee Combat: What sets Battleglide apart is its impressive blend of webswinging with combat mechanics. Engaging in gunfights while soaring through the air is a unique and thrilling experience, and the responsive controls ensure seamless transitions between swinging and shooting. Melee combat is equally satisfying, with a variety of moves and combos that keep encounters fresh and enjoyable. Progression System: The game's progression system is well-structured, offering players the opportunity to upgrade their abilities and weapons. Room for Improvement: While Battleglide excels in many areas, it's worth noting that some players may prefer a more in-depth narrative to accompany the gameplay. Additionally, occasional technical glitches or performance hiccups can momentarily disrupt the immersive experience, although these instances are rare and generally minor. Lastly, compared to other Spider-Man esque VR games, the swinging is very slow and focuses more on the realism of swinging rather than the fun of it. Conclusion: Battleglide triumphs as a VR game that seamlessly blends webswinging, gunplay, and melee combat in a visually stunning open world. The game's fluid mechanics, captivating cityscape make for an unforgettable gaming experience that leaves players eager for more. Whether you're a fan of Spider-Man or simply seeking an enthralling VR adventure, Battleglide is a must-play title that delivers on its promises.","This game is honestly one of a kind, combat is very unique and smooth. The flipping does need a bit of revamping (controlling it wise). But otherwise, very good. Also just so you guys know, if you want a bit more realistic flipping, turn off height assist for flipping.","I have been on a search for a spider man like game for almost a year now, and I have not found any that are as good and visually appealing as this game. Truly, I believe this game can easily become a popular game on the Quest 2 store. Do I recommend this game? Yes, 100% yes, thus the game is still in the works, and I haven't come across any major bugs or anything yet The game play is short, so hopefully, more is added in the future. Like making the NPC's so you can pick them up or hit them, that would give more content and fun. Besides that, this game is 100% worth it! You should all follow the dev on TikTok and YouTube to support his creations.","I’ve never been so impressed by a game, the combat, the swinging, the challenges, it’s all amazing, I’m proud to be a beta tester for this game and I hope this game gets the recognition it deserves, this game feels like it could be the next most popular Quest game!"
