Like all he did was have the player model head in every map. Isn’t it kinda sponsoring this game. Btw it’s really obvious that most if not all of the reviews are from mods from this game just saying that it’s “SoOo gOoD aNd WyXtT iS iDiOt”.,I am modeler/Dev so I am cool yayaya Also 1 star reviews are fake. They are sent from a person named wyxtt. Don't believe them.,So scary the game is horrifying I don’t even play it how scary it is,"This game is the best. I am moderator so I am epik gamer. Cosmetics are cool and satisfying, maps are creative and cool, fun gameplay, awesome community. Love this game",The best game Wyatt is a idiot
