The enemies and guns are varied enough for this to feel different to Pistol Whip. Not quite as polished as Pistol Whip, however it's very well presented, the guns feel great, and the music is very good. I love the weapons. Please provide a mode where you don't have to shoot to the beat and up the fire rate on the guns, as well as enabling the option to fire them at the same time. Highly recommended!","Main cons: It is a rythm game where you have to shhot to the beat. But the beat you have to shoot to is always the same regardless of what music plays ATM. Also the difficulty is rather challenging to unfair because of the limitations in dodging. And since the games progression system is linear., there is no way to see all the content without beating the levels in linear progression. The choice of music is masculin HipHopish. Pros: The rest of the game is quite good. Aspecialy the graphics are very nice made. The gunplay and gun styles are very well designed.",This game is very fun and fantastic I love how u shoot to the beat and ur moving around trying not to get shot in real life and the stages gets hard as u progress I really had a good time playing this can yâ€™all have a update to have more guns and more stages and have a update to move the song beat thing up so we can see when to shoot on point other than that I love it itâ€™s a workout and shout out to the devs for making this game thanks guys ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
