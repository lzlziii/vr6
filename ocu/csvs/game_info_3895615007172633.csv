The hands-on training is so essential for me. I don't absorb much without practical application. Buuuut that dang tape measure keeps bugging out. And because it stops working I can't continue the training. The following training emulations is where I've discovered the problem. - CNST108: Interior Finishing: Drywall.

You can really tell who's interested in training or not with this software.,I've tried to login or sign up but it says your app is out of date when I've updated it twice now would love to use this on my Oculus,"and well laid out interface! i wish there was a way to purchase a subscription or course by clicking on the specific content itself, and maybe add to the app description that a sub is required for most content. I'll most likely be using this soon, for various things! I love the unlimited potential for apps like this"
