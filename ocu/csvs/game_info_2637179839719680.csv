If you are considering purchasing this game (or others on Quest) click on my pic and then ‚Äúchat‚Äù to DM me as I can help reduce the price you pay. (See the end of my review for more help). This is the first Resident Evil game I have tried and I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. You play first person as special agent Leon S Kennedy whose mission is to rescue the President‚Äôs daughter. The game is a mix between a horror & survival game with ample selections of both. The story is great, the challenges are varied, the graphics are fantastic and it‚Äôs an excellent balance between difficult & demanding. The game keeps you playing for hours - it‚Äôs at least a 15-20 hour campaign - for me who got stuck 2 or 3 times battling an attacker it was literally weeks of fun. Some reviewers complain about the cut scenes - they didn‚Äôt bother me and, if you need to replay a scene because you died, you can skip through them and avoid listening to them more than once. I enjoyed this game so much that I was truly sad when I finished it ‚Ä¶ mind you the last scene took me a ton of attempts to survive. I am so hoping there will be another Resident Evil coming to the Quest and would buy it in a heartbeat. This, in my opinion, is a MUST BUY game!

This games atmosphere, horror, graphics are incredible. Being able to fight the enemies of your childhood is just amazing. The entire game is playable with mercenaries mode, firing range and the whole story. Most people who havent played vr know exactly what re4 is this is one of the first games you need on vr","Before this, I've never played any of the resident evil games. Having just beat this game yesterday after 12 hours of gameplay, I can easily say it is one of my favorite gaming experiences I've ever had. Immediately my thoughts turned to wondering what game I was going to play next that would hold its ground compared to resident evil 4. Near the end, the voice acting between Leon and Ashley gets a little crappy, but other than that, everything about the mechanics and puzzles of this game shine so brightly. I absolutely suggest playing this, The quest 2 can handle its physics way better than bone lab could, in my opinion","Listen I‚Äôm not gonna put it lightly, this is my my favorite VR game of all time. I used to know nothing about the resident evil franchise, but now I‚Äôm obsessed. Also, they captured RE4 in VR very well with great animations, Storytelling, and gameplay. The campaign is amazing and terrifying and the mercenaries ( a time trail game we‚Äôre the object is to kill as much as possible for rewards) is fun as well.Anybody considering this game, Stop considering and download it. Also the best part of the game are the merchants safe rooms. He is my proud little gun smith and he is just a peach."
