You can get bored pretty fast after going through everything. But I still love it.",I found space docker to be fun and relaxing. Though the objectives are simple the mechanics add a layer of difficulty that will keep you entertained. The main gameplay consists of picking up payloads and delivering them to a designated area. The payloads vary from simple containers to timed explosive nukes. Some are spinning and require you to stabilize it while others need to be chased orbiting black holes. Overall a fun little game with great visuals.,Very reallistic experience sometimes a bit frustrating because learning curve. I recommend if you are looking for some different space and spicy game.,"I love this game, very nice visuals (I also own the steam version) en sense of scale.","So glad I found this game, it is a refreshing change. Very immersive with great controls that are all configurable to your liking. Very challenging and highly addictive. The ships cockpit is really immersive truly giving a sense of piloting a ship through space in zero g. Using all the ships instrument readouts and docking camera are a must. Easy to pickup, difficult to master. if you're into space flight/sims this is the game for you. If you suffer from VR motion sickness this game probably wont be for you, but if you love the feeling of your stomach falling as you flip and spin while matching velocity with your moving target then you will love this game."
