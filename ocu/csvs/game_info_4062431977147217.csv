It brings me back to a time where things were less spelled out and where the games lived in your head. The game allows you to play seated, which let me feel more immersed because I didn't need to worry about hitting the cat, my partner or the walls. This is a fun 3/4 hour dungeon crawl that will have you fully immersed.","Its all right, just know going in your arms never move, you press a button to swing your sword."
