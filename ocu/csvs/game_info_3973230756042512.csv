As a result in 3 months I got 7.0 speaking score in IELTS exam. I look forward to practicing my interview skills to land the dream job. BTW I discovered they also have eLearning content and VR in your browser version of an app for those who do not have a VR headset. Highly recommended!,"VirtualSpeech is a comprehensive platform for building confidence and competence in the arena of public speaking. There are a number of courses that you can purchase through the website as well as a subscription model. However, I’d even recommend downloading the app just to check out some of the VR scenarios where you get used to being in front of virtual audiences. This app is potentially a game changer for those who want to build their skills in a safe, digital environment, before testing things out in the real world.","I have been using the app for a while, and I love the AI roleplay room, its great for practising! Answers vary on what you are saying and its like having a different conversation every time. I also like that you can choose your own name now. I think it really helps with immersion, feels like I’m doing the real thing. Recommended!","The tone definitely needs to be adjusted. People might write (formally) like Chat GPT, but nobody speaks like that. You need to pre-prompt it with “conversational” or “casual” or “informal”. Maybe “Spartan”. Having to press a button every time you speak is not very immersive. Also the window for saying something is incredibly small, most of the time you get cut off. The voice interpretation system needs to recognise when you have stoped speaking, and maybe learn to interrupt (like in real life) if it gets too long. I’ll be back if these areas improve significantly.",And still getting billed 45 dollars a month. No one will help me.
