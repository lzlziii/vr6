Eden Unearthed,Thousands of years into the future... There are no more humans… Or so they thought... The world is Eden and it is nothing like the one we know — but they do have apples. Lots of them. Use them for fuel and dash through Eden’s scenery in search of a trace of humanity.

But unfortunately that’s it to it. Had a decent story lineup but just stopped short with there being anything else. Would love more of the story/game and some action mechanics.,"I love this game really.I love how its basically a 2010 mobile app where you collect fuel and try to have the longest run possible.That’s fun and all but what took two stars off of this review is that after few runs the game feels kinda repetitive since you just start cycling between a forest and a desert READ THIS: the first minutes of the game sparks your interest but makes you want to learn more but after you learn that more humans are still alive it goes from a story driven game to an arcade game and I hate how it makes you want to know whats going on who’s in the big cube,why are you the last human,what was going on at the windmill,why do the bots sound like humans are a taboo subject to talk about,where did the distress call come from? This is all stuff the game/experience doesn’t tell you. This is what i hate about this it just feels incomplete.Its probably because this game is still on app lab , maybe its unfinished and maybe its just not approved on the oculus store yet but I really hope I can jump back into this soon to find answers to all my questions. Also at some crossroads on my way to a 100 000 kms i ran into a hole and couldn’t get out at about 84 000 kms. But what makes this game a jewel of app lab is that its relaxing and you can really just play for a while and still enjoy the scenery the incredible speeds and the cell-shaded bots.",If you have motion sickness this is not the game for you and due to the game not being fun for minutes and even seconds it’s like a game you will play when you have no internet or on a subway that’s the only times it’s enjoyable.,"Immediately heading into the game, I had high hopes because this game was developed by Netflix, but overall it underwhelming and didn't live up to my expectations. I was surprised that this game was only on App Lab and wasn't approved by Oculus, considering *it was made by Netflix*, but I don't blame them after playing it. The story seemed pretty generic, but had a little spice to it. I felt that it could maybe have some potential, but after 20 minutes of driving around doing the same pointless task of collecting apples (simply there to keep you entertained and engaged), I found that the story had stopped and I was in free play mode. It felt like something was missing, but that's all there was. There are a couple things I like, which were some of the monuments were nice to look at, it didn't completely reuse all landscape after the story and added some new pieces and I liked the style of the bike. It was a shame that the bike felt out of place for me compared to the rest of the world, if they had a consistent art style, then that would've made this a 3 star review purely based on nicer visuals. It doesn't have much replayability, unless you like driving games, but it has very little variation in terrain. It just cycles through grass plains to canyon, grass plains to canyon with nothing different. The simple obstacles were just annoying and prevent you from going full throttle on the bike and it would be nice if they could add some ramps to jump off of, but I highly doubt that they'll be updating this game. It's not worth your time.","Strange little storyline and a basic game premise that just is 't great, mechanics of the bike don't turn very well, and found myself actively trying to lose after a few minutes because I got bored. Would be nice if Netflix put the time into updating their Oculus Quest app with better viewing resolution, a better way to increase screen size and better environments to watch things in."
