Favourite part about it was when you would get to kill the demon and I love how some of them have a story to them my Favourite￼ chapter was probably chapter 3 with the baby where the wife was a Fashion model or whatever and she became pregnant and now thinks she is ugly?￼,"If you love horror, this game is amazing. More of an experience than a typical game. It's terrifying. But if you push through it, the rush is so good. I loved how all the chapters are so different with a new environment and story. This is like a fantastic Halloween event that I can do multiple times a year just to get in a horror mood and admire the grisly images. The graphics are great -- realistic and terrifying. I cannot wait for the sequel! I hope it's as good as this one.",I couldn't really get into the game as much as I really wanted to. I tried several times. The problem is I am not able to sit and play and I end up being like 3 feet tall. I kept hoping for some kind of patch for making able to sit instead of having to stand.,It's very scary,"Besides some minor complaints about physics and things, the game was scary (very) and the voice acting was great along with the story elements and block buster set pieces. This was my first VR horror game and I absolutely love it, I hope it gets a sequel and remember, I’m Saul Goodman. Did you know that you have rights? The Constitution says you do. And so do I.
