I was so excited when I played this, the sequel of Virtual Virtual Reality, and I played the first one like 100+ times. Despite being very different from V-VR, I genuinely enjoyed my play-through of V-VR2. The Chaz Mech’s controls took a while to get used to, but I eventually got the hang of it, and they’re pretty fun, but hard! I hate to see this game get so much hate because, maybe just the whole game itself, the start of it, not branching of from V-VR, and whatever else their complaints are. Really, Tender Claws, I could replay this game right now. Or even more replays! To be honest, I just love this game. Amazing job. And, I randomly got the thought: “What if there’ll be a V-VR3?” before I even finished. But now that I’ve finished, I don’t see that coming anytime soon. I feel like that’s a good ending to the story. Even though, well, we left Marty and Gavin behind, and now we’re a 60 year old, but…. I still love the story!","I was somewhat hesitant at the beginning due to bad reviews, about bugs and uninteresting game and such, but I trust tender claws and they pulled though with a masterpiece, arguably better than VVR (controversial I know) with the characters full of life the mechanics and worlds and interwoven plot lines. I could help falling in love, but great ending sold it for me a well done fair well and the banger to end all bangers led by our lord butter! This game may be a strange fever dream, but you should welcome, you won’t regret it.","I love this game so much. I have played the first and the second games and I have loved them both, I have nothing bad to say, everything about it was great. I was so upset when I finished it as it was that enjoyable!",It’s a work of art with beautiful graphics and lots of storyline as well with virtual virtual reality 1. One small problem I would like to point out is that when you want to recenter it make the place you want to recenter end up a bit away from you which is going to be a problem for the stationary players so please fix it.,"As someone who had a massive obsession with the first one years ago (Ive completed it hundreds of times), vvr 2 gave me a headache trying to play it. The controls were janky, and premise was weird. The story did not branch off from the first vvr, and i didn't understand anything that was going on, I was disappointed that they didn't build off of activitude and instead start anew. VVR 1 made me feel like an actual part of the story, while in this game, it feels like you're watching a 10-hour sequence of avatars bickering. don't play this game if you loved vvr 1 like i did and are expecting something at the same quality."
