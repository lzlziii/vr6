It’s practically the only game I play consistently. As a boxing trainer it is a great modern approach to shadow boxing. As a sparring partner yes & no. Yes as it will allow you get better with punching accuracy, distance between you and your opponent and pacing yourself when it comes to cardio. No, because sparring partners won’t move as robotic or predictable and when you get punched you WILL feel it and it can change the course of your strategy moving forward. However, with the use of AI in the future I can see this being dang near very close or better than sparring a real partner without injury. Overall, I use this for cardio and to improve on different techniques. I’ve personally have become a better boxer playing this game. Thrill of the Fight 2 is something I’m looking forward to! Highly recommend for anyone who wants a great workout and play a very fun game that NEVER gets boring! Every fight is a different fight!","While nothing is 100%, this game is responsive and semi sensitive so it’s not like you’re playing Eye Toy from the old PS2 games. It’s a good workout and a fun time. You can learn a bit by watching how the fighters move. Can be played in smaller spaces but you gotta be specially aware more or less or not move around too too much. Awesome time with a lot of space. I’m cheap and this is worth the money.","This game is awsome. Workout is super intense. Everything about this game is top level. But I do have some questions: Where are the updates? Maybe some new opponents, multiplayer, tournaments etc. Its puzzling for me that such top seller game doesn't evolve. Cheers P.S. Make some updates!!!","I’m a boxer and this game is the best I’ve played to shadow box basically, work technique, and cardio when going outside isn’t an option for me sometimes. I love this game you should most definitely get this game. Thrill of the fight 2 is coming soon and that will definitely be a great game as-well.","I don’t leave reviews on any games but TOTF is honestly the greatest game i’ve played, you really get the feel of boxing and the thrill of finally beating your opponent. It makes me feel like when I would watch rocky as a kid and he would make a comeback, the music hits, and you go crazy watching it. It’s that same feeling when you’ve been losing the whole round and with only a few seconds left you hit a hard right hook followed by an upper cut to knock down your opponent. All i ask is that you release TOTF 2 with the same type of style but just add multiplayer while keeping the realistic fights."
