I'd really appreciate a thumbs up if you find the previous link or the following review useful. =) Here's my review ^-^ Tentacular is a captivating VR game that immerses players in the charming world of a sea kraken. Unlike many other VR experiences, Tentacular provides a fully grounded and real sense of presence, making players feel like they truly inhabit the body of the protagonist. As a sea kraken, you solve puzzles and complete tasks with your tentacles, each movement providing satisfying feedback that feels natural and engaging. The game cleverly combines action sequences with a compelling storyline, giving players a rich and enjoyable gaming experience. The writing is witty and humorous, drawing players into a world filled with characters they care about. It's a refreshing departure from other VR games that prioritize momentary experiences over immersive storytelling. The accessibility and comfort of the PlayStation VR 2 add to the overall enjoyment of Tentacular. The headset's balance and comfort make it easy to wear for extended periods, and the controllers provide precise control for the game's tactile challenges. While other VR experiences may offer impressive visuals and mechanics, Tentacular stands out for its ability to make players believe they are truly transported to another world. Tentacular is a delightful game that successfully captures the essence of virtual reality, making it a must-play for VR enthusiasts seeking a full-fledged and immersive gaming experience. Whether you're a fan of action-packed adventures or heartfelt storytelling, Tentacular delivers an unforgettable journey that will keep you hooked from start to finish.","The artistic design of this game is fantastic. It really does make me feel like a big clumsy tentacle monster trying his best to fit in. The island of La Kalma is quaint and has a lovely Nintendo-like feeling. This game has so much brilliantly executed stuff. The art, the sound, the dialogue. The physics too. But the puzzles are not doing it for me. I feel like the puzzles are usually designed to have one correct solution but then the team realises they need to make more solutions, so they add a bunch of stuff and make sure it is technically solvable by another solution. The problem is I usually start working out a solution (or something that looks like it could become a solution) and then realize mine is not the intended solution. It makes me feel not great even if my hacky solution is working, because I know I am doing it wrong. The game tries to solve this by adding clutter and then adding lots of instruction, to make sure you find the solution while feeling like you found it. Unfortunately, this just means I get tripped up on the clutter or get frustrated about being told what to do. I would encourage the designers to deliberately create 2 (or 3) correct solutions to each puzzle. It may sound limited, but it makes a big difference. And maybe take away some of that clutter. Then I'll be able to find the solutions more easily. That allows you to make the instructions less instructional. This was a pretty brutal review but I hope the devs appreciate all the great potential of this game. It's not a bad game. If they rework some of the puzzles and sort this out, I would give 5 stars easily.",Tentacular is such a great example of a well made game I mean it’s just a game created very well for the purpose of a VR,"Wow, what an amazing game. The devs did a tentacular job. I wish there was a DLC though. If you want to destroy things then there is a mode for you, playground! You can build and destroy or do so much more. But wait before you leave or get to destroying save if you want your sandbox creation saved. Now that’s tentactular. I’m not one for heartwarming stories but man did I love this one. I love the physics in the game. I love the story development. The puzzles are so engaging and fun. They make your brain think. I love how I was over complicating a puzzle and when I figured out how easy it was it made me laugh so hard. If you like puzzles, destroying things, being a kiju like monster, or love building this game is for you. Again the devs did a tentastic job. High tentacle.",When I got really far in the game one day I opened the game and my game crashed on the main title so I restarted my headset and I re entered it and it crashed again so i uninstalled it and reinstalled it i opened it guess what…..
