Everything, mugs, things in chests, bottles, all gone. We thought we'd continue playing and just collect new resources, but my buddies couldn't plant things or see the things I've planted. We've tried a few things, but nothing helped, so we had to abandon the game :/",So for the first few hours it was SUPER good like $60 game good at times but today when I opened it it kept sending me back to my home and everything I did didn’t work it kept crashing and I still have 60 Gb of free storage and its updated but it just won’t work so idk if it’s the games fault or metas fault but otherwise it’s a good game.,The first couple hours was fun but. Then it felt like I ran out of things to do there’s no story I think the island should be actual islands and
