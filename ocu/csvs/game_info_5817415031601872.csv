Pather tank was ok but the Tiger tank was just a beast! Getting to know the tanks and it’s special skills is the key to victory. AI bots were a little slow, so I think if they had difficulty modes for AIs, it would totally be fun and challenging. I got to play against players at level 300 and it was so challenging and rewarding when getting the win against them. You just need to get the hang of the gameplay and you’ll fall in love with the game like I did.","I didn't know there would be a trial version, but I don't think it would be bad if I played the game first with this feature and moved on to the main game. I don't think this game is bad.",A realistic and strategic take on tank battles. Group matching provides a fun teamwork experience. I would love to see more tanks in the full version!,I like this tank game but it lacks something. That would be perfect if Dev team can make the unique story mode for this game.,When it was still playable it was fun but now its broken:(
