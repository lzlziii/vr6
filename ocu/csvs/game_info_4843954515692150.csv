However the disconcerting VR photos, aren't good. The photos are to small. The 3D element is very strange. And with the photos, I'm not sure if I'm looking at real photos or a model village as the photos aren't pin sharp. As more work goes into it, I'm sure it will get better.","To start off this app is a great concept and can improve alot before the full release. All the narration was great and I learnt alot. The big problem with this app is you feel like a giant an everyrhing looks so small and it feels really weird having a black circle arlund tour vision and not being able to look around when you turn your head. I think this should be an option as some users experience motion sickness fairly easily but it just didn't feel immersive. Another thing which could be done but would take a lot more work is the addition of being able to move around the venue using the controlls as right now I had the same experience as a 2d you tube video. The graphics seem to be nice and it looks like a great start, but sadly it dosen't seem to be for me right now but I hope that can be changed. P.s. if you make any modifications feel free to contact me so I can check it out.","First impressions As soon as I started the game it started downloading. Understandable, but it would be nice if the downloads are in the game already instead of downloading afterwards. For the rest the booting went perfectly smooth and no performance issues whatsoever. Positives The menus are straight-forward and easy to use. As soon as I started the experience and it loaded I was stunned, it's something I had never seen before. The 3d pictures are super cool, the details are absolutely amazing. The ""tour guide"" had a nice clear voice and was easy to follow. As a non-native english speaker the information is good to follow, no complaints there whatsoever. Negatives The first thing I noticed was the movement in the main menu. It's a little disorienting and not very easy to use. I would personally prefer the standard joystick smooth walk movement or the vive teleporting. The smooth rotation is nice though. It would also be nice to have the pictures a little closer to you because I really felt like leaning in constantly, maybe a setting for it or something. For the rest, no complaints, overall super cool! Looking forward to the future.",It's my first experience in VR museums and i'm not disappointed!)
