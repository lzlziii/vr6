I'm early 50's so started out playing vector-graphic games in the old arcades here in the UK so the graphics and soundtrack are perfect for me. All in all, a great product and looking forward to seeing more from the developer(s) Buy it!","I'm videogame player since long time ago, started in the old arcades, and this one got my interest. I've to say it's good! Three currently available games are nice, being the breakout the best and tetris good as well. We'll see how other games are. Please keep it updated, good work! Thanks",Growing up in the 80s this is the VR I was promised. Great relaxing game can be played sitting/relaxed. Brought me right back to being a kid. The retro graphics were awesome. My high score list for each of the three games is now filled with initials spelling out curse words just like the arcades of old. Well worth the $2. Looking forward to additional content!,"I love the vector style graphics of this game! Reminds me of all of the old arcade games back in the late 70s / early 80s that I’ve lost so many quarters on. I especially love the twist on the old Space Invaders game, very clever and unique! Same with the Bricks/Breakout style game and there’s plans for more games in the future. I can’t wait!! Woo hoo!","Love everything about it, the music and the voice over all the dynamic of the games, it's really well done, it's the old time arcades with a twist , congratulations to the team behind this great job , well worth the money, can't wait for what you guys bring in the future."
