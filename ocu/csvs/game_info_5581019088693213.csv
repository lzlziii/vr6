I used it everyday to make complex designs like I was an artist, but I also used to lay my head on it for a couple of minutes so it would seem as 9f I was sick so I would stay home from school.overall great game","I loved this as a kid and to play it now, is awesome. Really fun and creative.",NO MESS OR MISSING PIECES! Underrated. Good way to do some structured but free lance art.
