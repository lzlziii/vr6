I have used it since it launched in Beta mode and made great connections and friends for life. This is my escape when I need to get out of the real world to find the peace I needed. I am forever thankful to the developers and to Noah. Keep up the amazing work. Blessings to all and YOU ARE NOT ALONE. We have this Community.,I've had this app for a month and haven't been able to join a single group and it is beyond frustrating. There's not even a help or support section to receive any answers so I am very unhappy and dissatisfied with the app all together. It brings immense disappointment and sadness to log on to find a community of support and be shut out every single time. If I ever get to actually use my subscription maybe this rating will change.,"This app has been a GOD send to me. I have use this app since it launched and coming here has allowed me the Peace I needed to over come a sudden death and a very harmful incident that happened to me while at work. I thank you guys for what you're doing here and please, pleas, please keep up the amazing job.","I have been fortunate to find a place once called help club, and now, inner world. I was happy to see it hosted meetings for addiction, anxiety, stress, ADHD, Grief, Depression, Eating issues, Bad habits, or just meetings about Journaling, or work related topics like stress in the work place, and something called, BMI. It is and Immersion of Behavior Modification that we as group peers can all experience in our lives. There are no professionals, just peer to peer sharing in the challenges of our week, along with our successes. I have yet to come into my inner world, and Not feel seriously Welcomed by all in any Hub, or World, they offer! I feel understood, and I am heard. It makes no difference what day of the week or what time, I am welcome to be apart of a world that allows me, to be me, and to share in my good, as well as my tough days. I have found a Sanctuary, a place the brings forth my Serenity. I have found a meditation and guides that help me, to find my center. They never judge, or tell me how I have to work my serenity. But rather, they rejoice in my successes, and encourage me when I am sad, and that, they are there to listen, or to share their experiences, strength, and hope, if I would like to hear it. No one ever gives advise! I always leave with the feeling of not only being understood, but heard as well. I always leave having my spirits in a higher state of fortitude. I feel blessed for having found my inner world. I am Redeyed or Andrea Kr on Discord. The best part, I find those I meet in my inner world on my Discord too. I truly love being part of a place where it is a home beyond my home. It has become a place where strangers are friends, and friends are like family. I always loved my Star Trek, and Gene Roddenberry's vision of a place, where, we don't see race, religion, or politics, as the forefront to humanity, and his vision, has been my vision too. He saw a peaceful future with caring humans helping all of life. I do believe if he were able to see inner world for himself, this particular program would live up to his vision. I am Grateful to Noah, Natalie, and their team, for giving us a place to walk into the inner.world door of VR, a place, a place where wellness is our responsibility, but we don't have to do it alone. We have each other, and the Serenity of a Sanctuary Called inner world. Thank you from Redeyed/AndreaKr. A much healthier human and Grandmother for having the gift and quality of life because of inner.world."
