It has been updated since launch and I don't know how much worse it was then to now, as I literally bought it today. But, if you like racing games, this should be an instant purchase. Let's get the graphics out the way first. O.k, so I'm not sure why people expected a high end PC experience on a mobile phone, let's face it, that's what the Quest is. The graphics are absolutely fine. The most important thing of a racer is how it runs, and this is amazing. Smooth, and fast. In car models and dash are really nice here, as are the tracks and and backgrounds. Some of the cities look beautiful, especially at night. Weather effects are also really good. The only control method available is through the standard controllers, and it actually works brilliantly. Best enjoyed in an 9ffice chair with arm rests, or similar. It would be great if they added joypad control, motion wouldn't be accurate enough. Presentation is excellent. Menus, intros etc, all look fantastic. Value for money is insane. There is literally hundreds and hundreds of hours of continual play. The available cars to purchase is frankly staggering, and includes some of motorsports most iconic racers. Touring Car Capri anyone? I purchased the game this morning, left it downloading all day as it's a big boy, 32gig. Came home from work and put it on. I played till the battery went flat. Cannot remember the last time I did that. I plugged it in and played for another hour and a half. People's stupid opinion has wrongfully hampered this incredible games popularity. I hope and pray we get an upscale version for the Quest 3. My only gripe is that steering wheels don't work with the quest, that would be a truly incredible combination. This is a system exclusive for V.R, the oc version doesn't support V.R. Do not miss out on this incredible game, just because of early negative reviews. I honestly cannot wait to finish work tomorrow and get straight back on this. Never forget the refund policy exists, if you don't like it, you can get your money back. But for heavens sake try it. I guarantee you won't want to give it back.","(please read this full review if you feel like it, just so i may tell you what you should do depending on how good you want this game to look and how quickly you want to play it.) Keeping it as simple as possible- This game's racing action is the exact same as on console or computer, which is to say pretty good- especially in multiplayer lobbies. If you literally do not care how the graphics are, go ahead and grab your credit card, because this for now is the best racing game you'll get from this entire library of games on this entire platform. The graphics limitations on the Quest 2 make it run as well as it possibly can, and it does pump out very good frames and makes your experience as smooth as possible. You can adjust the resolution and refresh rate settings- I found it possible to tweak them juuust a bit higher, but not very much without beginning to lose frames. Now, if you DO care about how the game looks, wait for the Quest 3 to drop, as because of its' sheer power (hopefully) it should be able to run this game very well with better graphics. If you don't want to wait for the Quest 3, but you don't want the game to look bad, get it on your console (or computer if it's good enough, use controller to play there though). It's a good experience no matter where you go, but the Quest 2 might not be the best for you if you care a lot about graphics. I also have a 64GB headset so this takes up most of my storage meaning I can't play much, and it won't save your progress if you delete, but this is void if you have a Quest 2 with better storage or you buy a Quest 3 which starts with higher storage space. You can probably find more in-depth reviews about the gameplay in others' reviews- this is more about where you can consider getting it depending on your gameplay preferences. Have a good rest of your life, whoever's reading this! :)",Ok I know everyone hates this game for its graphics but you don‚Äôt notice it except the first level after that it feels like a good game. I honestly don‚Äôt know why everyone hates in this this game is fun and the cutscenes feel like a movie. Try this game if you are a casual fan not a critic. In total this game is 4.5 out of 5. The only bad thing is the first race then it gets good. Have a good day. Edit: Thanks for your guys support ‚ù§Ô∏è,I have been in motorsport as an instructor for many years and did have a rig and iracing etc till last year when I moved. I just thought this would be a bit of fun and arcade but it‚Äôs really really good. Of course it‚Äôs no substitute for a full rig but the game is brilliant. Hats off to the makers of this as for the limitations you have it‚Äôs amazingly well put together and fun. Even the controls are really well thought out as of course driving with controller is much harder than a wheel but it was just so easy to get used to. I don‚Äôt get the negative feedback it‚Äôs a really well done game with real attention to detail. I hope the makers carry on with Oculas 3 etc. Thank you this keeps the itch at bay a bit more until I can get another rig. Thank you developers üôèüëçüôåüëè,Attempted the game even after all the bad reviews and I'll be another to say def should not have passed the meta store for sale every VR game should have working hands and immersion. Also graphics but guess I'll have to stick to pcvr for the good racing games unless you devs can proove us all wrong and do a good update :)
