Swarm,"""SPIDER-MAN WITH GUNS — this is what VR was made for!"" SWARM is a fast-paced, arcade-style grapple shooter, with quick sessions, bright colorful worlds and globally competitive leaderboards that will take you back to the glory days of Arcade Games. Armed with just a grappling hook and your handy pistols, you’ll be plunged into a flow state as you grapple, shoot and battle your way to the heart of the SWARM before it’s too late. Twitch reactions won’t be enough to carry you through, you’ll need to think strategically and plan your next move to stay alive. Intense. Demanding. Exhilarating.

From a gaming standpoint this fully takes advantage of being in a virtual environment from the premise - grappling around and flying through an environment while shooting and dodging enemies in real time. This is not something you could effectively do or enjoy on a console or computer, but sit in a chair that spins and you can enjoy an exciting experience and concept that is an absolute blast to experience. The maps and enemies are unique, and the pacing of introduction of these things and skills or weapons is great. There is a wide variety of content in all of these experience categories that enhance and evolve the experience for the player continuously. Having built-in mods and difficulty levels is such a need for games. Being able to relax and enjoy casual mode, or challenge yourself with harder difficulties, while also adding the infinite energy and other mods allows you to define the experience and cater it to how you feel at the time. Art and aesthetic is beautiful. The design of the weapon is beautiful and thoughtful. It looks and feels like something that could actually exist and work, particularly in context of the game universe and the art style. The enemies are well designed and look like part of the same team, and their functions and designs make sense. My only mechanical complaints make sense in the game. You can’t simply hang with the grapple because the point of the game is to keep moving. Fire rate could be a little higher when just holding the trigger, I find slamming the trigger repeatedly definitely impacts accuracy when you’re flying around at speed. I haven’t unlocked everything yet, but I do find the weapon you fire and then trigger the bomb a little cumbersome. Multiplayer! I’m really excited to see this work but for now it is best avoided (BETA). I opened it and was immediately accosted by shrieking 12 year olds I couldn’t mute and just closed the game. Simple solutions - open the multiplayer to the menu that you select what type of game you want to join. Quick Play for a random match, Host to set up a match for public or private, and Join to be able to see a list of what’s available or join a friend.","You're stuck in a tiny arena zone (given that you can grapple-zip all over the place quickly). Enemies spawn in. You shoot them. You try not to touch the ground. So, basically, every level you double-grapple to go soaring way up in the sky, then look down to shoot stuff. When you fall enough, you repeat the double grapple to fly again and look down to shoot. There's little skill involved, and it gets boring fast. That's, of course, when they actually let you play it. During some levels, they just pause game play to tell you obvious stuff, like ""shoot the red areas of the boss"". Nothing ruins an immersion experience like stopping the action, and, ripping control away from the player to state painfully obvious, stuff that could have just been verbalized to you while the action kept going. This game feels like one of those arcade shooters that has a gimmick to draw you in, but super short levels and long winded intermissions for story telling. I'm not going to refund the game, bc it's an interesting concept. And, the grapple feels and acts natural. I just think they could have done more with this. It's just an arcade shooter that forces you to grapple every few seconds to keep from auto dying and restarting the level. M","You know how some games advertise as [Insert childhood game] but in VR, and it's kinda like it, or very much like it but without any improvements made for 20 years of tech? Well that's not this game. This game is everything I wanted as a little kid playing Galaga dreaming about the future.",It’s amazing like the description says your Spider-Man with GUNS!!! But you do get lots of the same swarm (things you have to blow up) and in the sandbox you only have the swarm you’ve battled.,"I don't know what else to say about this game. I usually look for realistic sport, action or puzzles solving games. But I decided to try Swarm in the 15 minute free trial. That's all it took...one try and I was hooked. This game is a riot! It combines shooting, flying and grappling into one of the best arcade style shooters I have ever seen in my life and I've seen them all in my 50+ years. Someone said 'spiderman with guns' I have to agree. It's free to try for 15 minutes...YOU GOTTA TRY IT! Devs. FANTASTIC WORK on this one!"
