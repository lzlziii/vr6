It's really difficult, as old school games were, but rewarding when you clear a stage. The only cons in my opinion are the soundtrack and the lack of a proper menu.",MasterGlory salutes this platform shooter! Only on the second level but have high hipes for what this developer has envisioned.,Ok so the dev challenged me to see how far I could get in this mega man esc sci-fi type shooter Even tho the graphics are basic don’t let that fool you This game is a challenge indeed Think your good enough Eh pick this awesome game up today,"I love the game and I’d give 5 stars, if there was a way to do a few basic things, such as there should be a Settings option. Just the simple ability to turn the music OFF. Also there should be a way to bypass the monologue at the beginning. I found that although upon starting the game you have an option to Continue or start New Game, it’s useless because I stopped at the second level and when I went back into the game and chose Continue, it started from the beginning, again. And store weapons. I’ve found a sword and a grenade but no where to store them. A few tweaks and this would be a perfect game. But is still well worth the money. The graphics are good. Just wish the metals were more shiny and metal looking because the leather or skin walls are fantastic."
