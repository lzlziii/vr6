I was expecting a small minigolf game, but it's really something unique. The most important thing first: it's really a lot of fun. The graphics are good, the controls are very well done, the physics are spot on, and the gameplay is excellent. Definitely worth grabbing for this little price. 5 stars!",Super simple game but the gameplay progression is fun enough to keep you going. Nice casual game for casual puzzle game players (like me).
