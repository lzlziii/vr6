immerGallery Demo,"It is our goal to create the world's best immersive image viewer for VR180 and VR360 photos (2D & 3D). In immerGallery Demo, you can explore 50 pre-selected images in a highly immersive format. By adding sounds, voice-overs and special effects, we open the way to immersive storytelling with VR photos. The photos are from various places around the world, e.g. Germany (Oktoberfest and castles), Japan and great beach locations. The example images are in VR180 & VR360 format and in low field of view 2D / 3D. This demo is a preview of our full version: immerGallery! The full version enables you to view your own images in a convient way. Create your own immersive galleries by adding sounds and special effects through the generator tool on our website and watch them in our app.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Media Player,English,1.1.8,immerVR GmbH,immerVR GmbH,https://www.immerVR.com/,"Mar 17, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4598517593539197/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4598517593539197&r=1, https://www.immervr.com/Privacy-Policy.html",1.05 GB,ImmerGallery is an intuitive VR app that is unique. It lets you experience photos in a very special way. The demo images are very impressive and an immersive experience is possible. I will definitely get the full version.,"This is the app I've been looking for for a long time. When I travel, I usually take a lot of photos, and since last year I have been using a Canon RF 5.2 Dual fisheye to create 3D photos in VR180 format. This application is exactly what I need for comfortable viewing of photos, I can share my impressions with my family and friends. Thanks a lot!","I think this is a wonderful application. The free demo version allows me to see pictures in a way I had never dreamt of. When other applications are free for only 15 or 30 minutes, it's even endlessly free. It gives me the wish to upgrad to the paying version and all the more so as the I've received kind advices from employes when I've asked questions. It's simple, intuitive and the effect is impressive.",The demo app really is something you have to experience. There are plenty of galleries that show the excellent quality the app has to make looking at photos a wonderful treat. The galleries in themselves also give you lots of insight in how to make 180 0r 360 photography work at its best. It really made me wanting to dive into 180 photography on a more professional level. And I know I'm assured of a simply great app to look at my photos in the best possible way.,"Viewing 360 photos in a VR headset is the only way to appreciate how immersive they can be. The ImmerGallery demo really shows how well the app can be used to create an immersive experience from 180/360 photography, showcasing work from some very talented photographers. For myself seeing what could be done from a drone has me practicing shooting 360 spheres, and I look forward to creating a complete 360 experience using the slideshow customization tools used in slideshows on the demo app. And, I'll have to rethink the 180 3d thing. It hasn't appealed to me before, but they can actually look pretty good too! Check it out!! Dave Snow"
