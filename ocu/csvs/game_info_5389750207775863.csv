Monkerooms,"Run, hide, be a explorer and don't get lost! watch out whatever comes in your way! You and your monke friends are exploring the liminal spaces, but god if you hear something it sure has hell heard you. You need internet access to play with your friends, you won't be glad if you don't find other explorers. You will be chilled to the bone if there aren't any other players but don't worry your never alone in a liminal space! this game was designed to give information about the backrooms and what would it be like exploring it with your fellow friends. This game was inspired by workingclassduck's backrooms game. His game includes monsters, multiplayer and gorilla locomotion! So I got a little creative and have made the Monkerooms! Credits to stereo monke aka ( creator of mouse runners ) for helping me with the game!!

Much rather would prefer a linear level line up than this. And there is a glitch with the Netflix tv",The game is fun and a little scary and I love the player model so many levels secret levels and more,This game is bad because when I played no one was there and plus when I did the second level I went up to the monster and it didn‚Äôt even move,"It really fun, everything is poorly made",Great game but the bugs are limitless I will be honest the multiplayer bug is bad I can't get into the game and I can't see my own avatar you guys are not as good as no clip but Evan no clip got bugs to so I hope you guys will fight your way to the top I believe you can but you got to realize games don't come easy I have made my own game before it is hard work you always got fix bugs that someone finds so keep trying don't give upüòÅ
