Loved the light dynamics and feel of the dungeon navigation. That said, it needs a lot of polish in its current state. The tutorial did a decent job, but the game objectives and menu navigation were really unclear after that point. The ""warp"" effect that completely blocks your vision when running into a wall felt super weird. Perhaps ""ghosting"" the actual map terrain with a translucent portal overlay could achieve a similar design while not completely removing the ability to keep track of your body in space. The teleporting felt extremely sluggish. Would much prefer an aim indicator showing where the dice is going to go, and then an immediate teleport to that spot (e.g. A Township Tale). These types of games often require some level of reflexes when dealing with enemies, so clunky movement can really ruin the experience. All in all, wish the developers the best of luck! Definitely some promise here if the kinks are ironed out.",I tried a few games recently. Zephyrus seems promising indeed in its fantasy world. Substantial gameplay combined with great visuality. The Demo hint at some great features of the Zephyrus Prelude which I'm curious to try.,"...for a demo :) Worth to try, I'll buy the 3 map Prelude version!",Enjoyable demo. Took a little while to figure everything out but got there in the end! Nothing major to change personally. Not sure what will be in the main game but maybe a sprint option would be an idea? Looking forward to release of main game,"Played on Quest 1. When I first played this game (demo) I actually did not know what to do. But i continued to try, and after a while i (guess) discovered how things worked. Great to see things change after achievements. Great small discoveries to be made. Perfect for a free (demo) game. I am curious how the full game will become. So, here's 5 stars"
