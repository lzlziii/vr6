It’s fun the graphics look amazing very bloody when you die I think multiplayer would be fun too at least help with the missions but five star from me,"Primal hunt is my Favourite Game!!! And I have completed all hunts. But I’d like to make some suggestions for what’s to come to the game. I would love to see a Snow biome with it’s 5 maps. I saw that in the Roblox beta video one of the characters had a Sword like weapon that will be a nice addition to Primal hunt VR. Next are the animals, in the Snow biome it will hold Trex, Raptor, Trikes, Entelodonts, Saber-tooth’s, Mammoths, Pteranodons will not be present due to the harsh weather. Lastly are new animals Megaloceros, Wooly Rhino, Megatherium, Argentavis, Dilophosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Carnotaurus, Spinosaurus, Therizinosaurus, Iguanadon, Dryosaurus, Pachychephalosaurus, Quetzalcoatlus and they all have Tech variants and trophies. Also I’d like a Tech Raptor full body trophy. Again Phaser lock these are all suggestions, hope these ideas help ur company out with Primal hunts next big thing!!","Great Monster Hunter lite game that has a lot of strategy. It is very immersive and has plenty of gameplay. with tons of reason to come back so you can fill your trophy room. It is not a run and gunner type game. It is more sneak and kill, just like hunting IRL. Honestly this is top ten on my list of quest games and I own hundreds so that’s good. It is a slow starter and slow burn but well worth it. My style of play. Great job Devs. Not many bugs and graphics and sound are very serviceable. Highly recommend. Hope eventually multiplayer will come. I play mostly solo but understand a lot of people like that. Cheers!"
