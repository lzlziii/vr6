The idea of VR boxing is very appealing and the look and style of the game sets it apart. The game would definitely be a lot better if it had custom song support as it does on PC and also if it had oculus achievements as well. But overall a very enjoyable experience!,"Definitely an interesting experience. The glove skins are cool, with the demonic looking ones being my favorite! I'm curious whether that reactive lights map might come to the Quest, but either ways I'd be eager to give this a go on my PC. At the same time I did find myself enjoying the simple map the most. Also is there any possibility of having French support?","Box to the Beat is fantastic experience! The movement with the music feels so satisfying. Reaching the highest score on the leaderboard was EPIC, adding an extra layer of excitement to the boxing gameplay.","Tried Box To The Beat VR and it's got potential. Graphics are solid, and the glove skins look great. Not having custom song compatibility was a letdown. But if you're into VR boxing, this one's worth considering."
