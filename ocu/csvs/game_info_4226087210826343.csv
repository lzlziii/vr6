Having previously enjoyed a realistic VR ping pong game, my expectations were high. While the app certainly has its merits, there are several aspects that leave much to be desired for those seeking a truly immersive themselves in the sport. Pros: The idea of being able to practice pickleball in a virtual environment, especially for those who may not have easy access to real courts, is a great concept. Cons: In many ways, Pickleball VR is disorienting. The ball-shooting-machine (BSM) will shoot the ball at various parts of the court at various speeds with little indication of what's about to come. Upon shooting the ball, you're teleported to the general location of where that ball will land. Regardless if you hit the ball or miss the ball, you have to wait for 2 bounces before the BSM will shoot the next ball. That can range anywhere from .5s to 5s. The lack of a consistent cadence makes it difficult to establish a rhythm and can be frustrating for players seeking a seamless session. Customizability is essential for any sports training app, but unfortunately, the VR pickleball app falls short in this regard. The vast array of settings is overwhelming, and despite the options, it fails to offer the ability to configure consistent shots in a specific area at a particular cadence, which is crucial for focused practice sessions. Moreover, the app's in-app purchase for additional options only exacerbates the clunky experience. With the promise of new game modes that may be a better experience, I gambled and purchased a couple only to find myself with the same issue - clunky sessions and unable to get into the flow of the game. I have hope that with development, this app can become one of my frequented apps. Until then, while it may serve as a fun pastime for VR enthusiasts, serious pickleball players might find it falls short.","PickleballVR has revolutionized my approach to conquering the net and improving hand-eye coordination. With its stunningly crafted graphics, transporting me to diverse environments like stadiums, arenas, islands, and mountains, the game's visual appeal is unparalleled. But what truly sets it apart is the impeccable physics engine, faithfully replicating the intricacies of real-life Pickleball gameplay. A quick 10 to 20-minute session before hitting the court allows me to gauge my progress and enhance my skills both at the net and from the baseline. Whether you're a novice seeking to learn the game or a seasoned player, PickleballVR offers an extraordinary gateway into the world of Pickleball. It earns my highest rating of A+++++, delivering an immersive and transformative experience that transcends reality.","I’m a fan of FP Tennis, Eleven Vr and Raquet NX. This game is still a work in progress and should be priced lower than $19. The multiplayer option doesn’t work right, which I found was disappointing. However, despite some bugs, I did finally get the groove and tempo of the game and I was able to beat the bot at the medium setting. The game can be addicting, but only if you are patient with it. Hopefully the Developer will polish it up in the near future. In my opinion this game as it stands now is worth about $5 to $8 bucks, not $19. UPDATE 8/16/23: Down to a 1 star rating from a 4 star. I am one who doesn’t have the patience with games that one day you earn this amount of points for activity you do, then the next day, or a few days later the same activity does net as much in points. The drills in this game that I enjoyed doing now do not offer the same point value. It’s a shame the developer cannot make up his mind, but because of this I wouldn’t recommend this game as being ready for the Meta store. UPDATE 8/23/23: Copy from my Discord DM from developer dated 8/17/23 “I am reverting the change to reduce number of points for drills. Now you would be able to earn more points by playing games with rallies.” This copy of a message sent by the developer dated 8/17/23 on my Discord DM with him proves a change in drill points value was done, proving my review at the time it was made on 8/16/23 was true, yes later he reverted back. I do not appreciate his later follow up posts or comments on this review thread making me appear dishonest. I have uninstalled this game. In my opinion it does not feel like IRL PB, having to manipulate different buttons to achieve different types of shots is just not realistic. Now at the other App Lab game “Playin Pickleball” with their latest update I find it to be much more closer to capturing the IRL sounds and physics with no pressing different buttons at all to control ball physics. It’s a much more cleaner and smoother experience with the UI there as well.","My husband and I just got VR headsets less than a week ago. We are IRL players and wanted to be able to keep playing in the summer months when our AZ temps are brutal. Although I am not tech savvy I was able to start playing the game immediately. What is amazing is the ability to finely tune just about every aspect of the game. In addition the ball machine is invaluable as it shoots balls quickly and from all different directions. We are still in the learning curve but I have no doubt that this will give me hours of enjoyment, valuable skill practice and very good exercise. As a bonus, the developer is so passionate about this game and app that he is involved in the Discord community and is constantly tweaking it to bring it to perfection! Thanks for another wonderful way to enjoy the addictive game of Pickleball.","Follow Up 8/4/23: So many new features... but the best is mixed reality mode which allows me to play safely in my garage since I can clearly see my room and surroundings while playing and the passthrough on my quest pro is sharp and in color. I use manual run and set play area to half court. Using my own legs to move is so much more immersive. Try it... I'm sure you'll like it. New app that's fun to play. Developer is very communicative and willing to make adjustments to improve game play as needed. Follow up 9/15/22: playing app for 20+ days now. Developer has refined and improved performance with almost daily updates/ releases. It's a much better app than it was 20 days ago. If you felt the app lacking back then I suggest you revisit and give it another try. Probably best to check back again in the future also to see how it evolves. Follow Up 10/1/22: So many updates/improvments, Like the song says, It's Getting Better All the Time. Follow up 10/17/22: Multiplayer up and running/ nothing further need be said. Follow up 10/24/22: I think JParkerDotCom is a bot. I asked him why he thought one of my favorite apps has a problem and he never answered plus Oculus doesn't list Pickleball on the list of apps that he has purchased. Finally, this app continues to improve daily."
