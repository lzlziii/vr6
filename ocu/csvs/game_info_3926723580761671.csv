I bought a turret but I don't even know where it was build or if it was getting build. Only one opponent for the demo. Graphics can also be improved. I would recommend to add 3-4 coop team work and turn the game into something like cook out but with shooting and building turrets.,"This game is great! I truly had a fantastic time flying around like Iron Man and using what felt like a rail gun. The gameplay itself is fun, and pretty intuitive. The main thing I would love to have is an option to place turrets exclusively with the left hand. You have to accurately click on a menu while simultaneously trying to make sure you keep an eye on shooting enemies, which really breaks the flow of the battle. One other thing that would be nice is to have the game be a bit less punishing. It's a little ridiculous to have the negative purchasing points pile up, which feels like a 90s game. Matches the aesthetic, but it's not fun to play with and makes me want to just restart rather than grinding my way out."
