And I wouldn't call them relentless. ""A variety of weapons"" You get a pistol, crowbar, and knives. That's it. That's literally it. This game has a fleshed out tutorial level with video guides, but a lot of features shown in it are used only once or twice (like using certain types of items or methods of navigation). What's here is alright. The story is... well, a story I guess. There's a couple of creepy moments, and the atmosphere is good. The live-action scenes shown throughout the game are actually pretty neat (assuming they're original and not stolen). And the game functions perfectly with no issues. But there are two huge flaws with this game. First of all, there's just not enough. There's not enough zombies. The couple times where there's a ""horde"" there's only like, 4 zombies. There's not enough interesting game mechanics either. The mechanics that are used in this game, that even get their own dedicated tutorials, are just way underutilized. And secondly, the zombies are total pushovers! It's a zombie survival horror game, yet I spent the majority of my playthrough (on the hardest difficulty btw) tossing the undead around like sacks of potatoes. And they're so slow... Hardly a threat if I can just toss them to the side and run right by. I'd rate this game 2 stars, but the Mixed Reality Horde Mode is actually quite fun and unique. Enough to bump the rating up a star. You fend off the undead in your own home (using Passthrough), you can choose difficulty, time limit, and even a day/night mode, and since it's a horde mode the zombies are actually a threat! Still slow and simple, but they can gang up on you fast in later rounds. Oh and the puzzles in this game are just fetch quests. A common trend with indie horror titles unfortunately. This game should be closer to $5. Maybe $10 if the main story mode had more content. But the zombies suck, they're few and far between, and the game is too short. What's there could be good, but like I said; there's just not enough. You should ""Take Care"" of your wallet by saving your money, or if you really need some good zombie action then check out The Walking Dead SnS, Organ Quarter (App Lab), Cosmodread, or Propagation: Paradise Hotel.","I went into this game thinking it was just a VR Resident Evil clone, man was I wrong. This is more then just a VR zombie survival game. It has you trapped in a hospital solving puzzles to unlock new places, collecting items, killing zombies. All the Resident Evil elements. Then you realize the game starts to get creepy, supernatural creepy and has a great story that unfolds with it. Horror fans, you are going to love this game. They took action survival and made it scary and a good story. Zombie fans, you are it for a great surprise. This is a great addition to my horror VR collection.","Take Care VR is a atmospheric VR Horror game that throws you into the depths of a hospital. Your mission is to seek a women (which I have not found out why yet). The game has a very good setting system allowing you to choose from standing or sitting which is always a win in my book. You can also choose a simple reload style for easy access. The tutorial level is full of things to play with so you can get used to the items and the environment. The game does a great job of creating a creepy atmosphere. You get a good jump scare from the start and you constantly are waiting for the next one to happen. There are several puzzles that you do have to solve in order to progress but they are just hard enough to make you really think about it and not get mad about. Overall the game feels great. The only complaint I have is with the interaction system. Sometimes it feels a bit too ""heavy"" when trying to open doors and swing your crowbar. This game is for anyone that likes puzzles and VR Horror jump scares. This game gives great vibes of Silent Hill/ Resident Evil too! Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhZ7ZmUiObg","It's got the perfect balance some awesome mazes and moving platforms to.explore with some serious freaky zombies to shoot, good stuff indeed . It's creepy suspenseful and ambient sounds keep u on ur toes","Having fun with the game, it's not a fast paced in your face horror, more a slow burn puzzle horror so far. Im still quite early in the game but am looking forward to whats in store. Devs are working on the game and have already posted updates. I like to see new vr games and will always support active devs. like these. I won this game in a dev key giveaway but it does not influence my rating/review."
