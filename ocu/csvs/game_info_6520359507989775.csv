Gwack-a-mole,"Welcome to Wacky Farms, home of the world largest pit-less avocados! On the farm your job is to smash the avocados as quickly as they appear. You keep smashing and they keep coming. And at all cost avoid smashing the rotten avocados. Game Features: Timer Mode: Just like the classic arcade game Whac-a-Mole, get as many as possible within the time limit. Survival Mode: Continuous play, but miss enough avocados in a row and you will be eliminated! Three playable game boards, each with its own level of difficulty/skill. Up to 8 players can compete using one headset. Left handed smashers compatible. Dual wield feature, for extra smashability!",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Roomscale, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Arcade, Casual",English,0.1.27,eStudio NooN,eStudio NooN,http://www.eStudioNooN.com/Gwack-a-mole,"Dec 29, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6520359507989775/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6520359507989775&r=1, http://www.estudionoon.com/Gwack-a-mole/privacy-policy.php",120.1 MB,"Fantastic, had great fun","Great stuff. I don't know if this title is being updated, though; if it is, here are my thoughts: - The lights that flash when you smash avocados can be a bit bright, yet there is no way to reduce the destruction flash - I couldn't find any way to turn off the music - Endless Mode needs a stopwatch that keeps track of how long you've been going at it - Endless Mode should have a change of music from time to time (right now, it's one track that keeps going nonstop) - Endless Mode should have some kind of mistake counter or something; as it is, I have no idea of how close I am to game-over at any time I wish there was a wall-mounted version of the avocado table that involved more arm-reaching above, because having to lean over to reach the farthest avocados can become a bit taxing on the lower back after a while. New game idea involving hammers and nails in a wall maybe?","This app is simple, but incredibly polished. They did a good job making it super satisfying every time you smash a guac. The harder levels are very exciting. My favorite part was learning how to optimize my swings to get several in one go, rather than doing the traditional wack a mole motinons.",Everything about this game is stupid in its simplistic form and I LOVE IT! Developers why are you not charging a dollar for this? This is simply the best game on app lab! This is a must have! Get it!,"Fun, cute & simple but the mechanics remind me of the HIT section of FitXR. If the table was turned so it‚Äôs a wall instead of a table this would be a nice little workout app! Please consider doing that. And if you could punch the avocados (or make them balloons or something) instead of the hammer, even better. The sounds and splatter effects are satisfying. I‚Äôm always looking for more fun workout apps and this could be one with a few minor changes! And this counts towards the Move app in calories and exercise minutes üòÅ I wouldn‚Äôt even mind an empty space with a choice of skyboxes and a simple wall with a bunch of shapes popping out using the same mechanics as the avocados and punching them with cool sound fx and explosions. Hope the devs consider this. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a rhythm game, just punching and explosions. It would also be nice if your score was saved so you could try to beat your score. As it is, this game is cute and fun, but I could definitely see this made into so much more with a few changes. The app warns that you need a lot of space, but you really don‚Äôt. I played while sitting on my bed. I might even try playing this first thing in the morning in bed to give me the energy to get out of bed lol."
