GRAB,"GRAB is a multiplayer parkour game. Climb, jump, slide and swing through the levels to reach the end, but don't fall or touch the lava!

Features: - Active and fun physics based controls - Play with up to 10 players in cross platform multiplayer - Built-in level editor that lets you build levels together with your friends in multiplayer with quick switching between testing and editing - Download levels made by the community and upload your own - OVER 100000 Community levels! More every day! GRAB is currently in EARLY ACCESS! This means that while it is already fun to play, it is far from finished. A lot of planned features are still missing or incomplete and there may be some bugs and crashes.",7+,"Multiplayer, Co-op","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Social, Sports",English,0.33.3,SlinDev,SlinDev,https://slindev.com/grab,"Nov 25, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4104088956355944/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4104088956355944&r=1, https://slindev.com/privacy/",Terms of Service,123.6 MB,Gud üëç don't scroll . Hey wat u doin Stop Actually pls stop Fine here's banan üçå,"The level editor is very easy to use and can still be used to create complex things. And I love creating things and pushing my imagination to its absaloot limates! but (hears a suggestion, it would be very cool if you could collect grab coins over time [100 per day] and from completing verified levels you could get like 10 coins per level using these coins you could perches gear from the shop)",This game is incredible the editor mode is awesome. its incredible how i see verified players make the most wholesome builds. the social talking is wonderful this game is highly recommended to play if your a person with creative thoughts the maps are wonderful and it might take time to build but hey we got people to help us in building so this is why this game gets 5 stars,I highly recommend this game there is very friendly community it's free and fun I recommend this game alot to my friend's this game is perfect but the one thing I would love is to reset our complexity so the you would have 3000 for and then 6000 I think this would make way more better maps so we could make more and complex things I hope you take this into consideration slindev but amazing game overall 10/10,This game is so fun and addicting from playing community levels and making your own you have a certain amount of complexity of 1500 but if you get verified you get 3000 and building your own map is so fun after doing it a couple times they even have a discord this game deserves to be a famous game 5 star and last of all the editing is super easy to use
