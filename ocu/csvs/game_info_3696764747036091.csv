Will it be charged?","It's an wonderfoul app but, i have been trying to play it in the last 2 weeks and does not work, i was feeling my focus and mem√≥ria improoving but...... can not play anymore","This game (as good as it ""Could"" be) is coming up on a year (in June) with ZERO (I'll say it again), ZERO updates.... That is really unfortunate for a game that has so much potential...","Great great app. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it only lets me play 1 game a day until I unlock all the others which it looks like I have to play 30 days to do! If there is another option, let me know! Love the brain games and graphics. Excellent !","That app is great! I'm gonna use it almost every day. Only one little thing anoying is the back ground. I don't know, I felt my eyes were forcing little. I did not check if there are different back ground available but, if not, it would be usefull I beleive. But wow! Nice work!"
