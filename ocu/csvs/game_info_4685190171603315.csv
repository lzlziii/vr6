I will start off by listing the things I liked about this game. Pros: One I like the tutorial. It's very quick and straight to the point and is hands-on with its info. Two, I like the ui, it's very simple and I like that. The blue in there is also really nice. Finally, I like how every button on the plane is usable, making this plane feel more immersive to fly or get started. Cons: Well, this is going to be alot, so first of all there's only one plane which from the little I got to use of it doesn't even seem to be that close to how most real life planes would fly. Basically, the physics from some gameplay seems mid. Next, the game requires you to pay for hours. Yes, it is the main reason people have been review bombing this game, and we'll understand it's an understandable reason. No game should require to pay five dollar to just to play it. The game does give you a 15 min free trial, which sounds good, that could be since that could be the length of a full solo flight but here's the thing, it also counts those 15 min in the bloody tutorial ! Like, really, that's like the equivalent of having a free trial for a game that lasts an hour, but first hour has like 50 minutes of unskipable cutscenes so you get like only ten minutes of gameplay. Here's the thing you can pay for the price of $31 dollars you buy five hours, which is well very overpriced in my eyes. Why is it overpriced? we'll as we went over before you get only one aircraft to play that doesn't seem to be that realistic. Here's what $31 in other flight Sims pcvr and quest 2 will get you. In Vtol vr, the base game is is $20 and the tyro 55 is $5, so the numbers line up. In Vtol vr, every aircraft has a huge learning curve, and on top of that, there is training missions, and for a few of them, there is a campaign for them. In dcs world, the game itself is free and comes with 2 planes. Both are pretty realistic, and when one of the ww2 or Cold War planes are on sale, they go for around $24 if im correct. These planes by themselves are pretty close to the actual planes and can be used for combat. Now for quest simulators, first you got ultra wings 1 and 2 which are combat and stunt flight Sims, there's WW1 warplanes fighters and ww2 pacific theater game made by the same people that are both $19 that have a full campaign on both sides of each respective war. Finally, there is simple planes vr that mixes general and military aviation and has mod support on pcvr and quest. As we can see, there is games that provide more bang at around the same or lower prices. A good fix to this would be to make the game $5 and have dlc liveries, maps, scenery, activities, and mission to add up the money the consumer could spend. But no, I can you guys are more concerned with making money than making a product that every can enjoy.","At first I thought it was great. Not as realistic as it looks, you get a 15 minute demo which is ok i guess but then you have to pay per hour. If you could give a game - stars, it would be rated -infinity. You have to log in, pay for hours, support barely exists and the owner doesnt seem to care. If anyone is buying hours in this game, WAKE UP AND REALISE WHAT THIS GAME IS. Its just a money printer for the owner. There is probably like 5 ppl obsessed with this game that buys hours all the time thats the only income the owner gets. If the owner sees these reviews, We all have ONE thing to say to you: MAKE THE GAME FREE OR YOUR GOING TO LOSE ALL OF YOUR INCOME AND USERS!!! IGNORE ALL REVIEWS THAT ARENT SAYING THIS AND DO NOT GET THIS GAME","1.- Get a demo of 15 minutes, basically it is made to see the tutorial extremely slow and useless. 2.- I was able to fly a plane without knowing how, just by pressing the buttons and pulling the levers on your TERRIBLE IX created to simulate a real plane and I was able to fly for about 12 minutes, in my case it was impossible to land while doing extreme curves over the airport something impossible to achieve in real life BUT, it was worth it. Would I buy the game? With those horrible controls and at that price... I'm not crazy!",This game is just horrible I hate it do NOT recommend you have to pay for flight hours and it’s just a wast of time and money no 3D buildings no nothing I got so excited to find out that this game was free but when I got in I got to fly for 15 minutes and the prices for the flight hours are ridiculous once again I DO NOT recommend,It’s so dumb it’s really cool flight sim but you have to pay to fly that’s so retarded if the maker of this game is reading this the reason why you’re game has such a low rating is because you make people pay to fly so you should fix that you you money hungry pig
