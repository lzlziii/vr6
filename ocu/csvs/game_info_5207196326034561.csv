The visuals are freakin cool and the 6-7 songs on here are really good songs. Iâ€™ve only played the drums so far and have never had so much fun on the vr. If the developer sees this PLEASE keep working on this game. I love it so much!","Great tutorial, great use of the IX instrument, really great songs, this has the potential to be a AAA game in its own genre, if the developers keep it free with the option to buy songs and other upgrade options (how about offering to add combos of riff or creating tools to create your own songs?) could be the way to keep the most Meta users in the game 24/7",The game is all I thought I would be and even more. All the songs are really fun to play and it's pretty easy to learn how to play. The community is really supporting and the devs are really responsive and honest.,I played for about a hour so far and I have been hooked on it it is fun and a workout if you like to play rhythm games such as beat saber etc. I also enjoyed that there is co op and you can play songs with your friends.,Not the best the controls are not the best and my timing was right but it said that I had missed and that was a little annoying to say less. Tbh it could be better.
