Very cool environments! It‚Äôs like RC car racing BUT you have many different camera angle options. You can race the car from above the track in RC form, or change the view to where you‚Äôre IN the car or you can be behind the car. You can do regular racing or a Mario kart type mode with power ups.

Wish I had more time and friends with time to play this. :)
