But the game would be even better if all the arcade games worked.,"Paranormal Detective: Escape from the 90's is an extremely fun escape room game that knows how to have a good time. One of the things I love about it is that it doesn't try to take itself too seriously! They absolutely nailed the 90's vibe and you can tell the devs just had a blast recording the bits as you progress through the puzzles. For those who haven't experienced escape rooms yet, I highly recommend this as a good introduction. If you get stuck, the optional hint system does a really good job at helping you along without blatantly giving away the answers. For future development, I'm aware the devs are looking at an Arcade Only game mode where you can just spend time playing the arcade games, with multiplayer strongly desired by the devs as well. Fingers crossed there's enough enthusiasm from players to realize this game's full potential! As it stands, it's well worth the purchase just for the single player storyline that it has right now. I can't recommend this game enough.","Video Review https://youtu.be/tm1wMBAQg04 Paranormal Detective: Escape from the 90's is an odd title as its a mystery kind of detective game but also your own personal arcade on your quest 2, I played it for the arcade aspect and really loved the variety of titles though I did think the games were kind of lacking the combination of them definitely made it feel fun to play around for an hour trying them out and hanging out. Watch the video review for gameplay of the games in the arcade and my full thoughts on the arcade in this title.","Remove the space before "".com"" to use code. https://www.oculus .com/appreferrals/FastShoes/5527428103958081/?utm_source=2 This is a fun escape room game that has a neat variety of puzzles and finds a good balance between easy and hard. It's certainly not perfect, but it's worth a look if you like escape room games along with some 90's nostalgia and some humor thrown in for good measure."
