The art works are delightful , the gameplay are challenging. Please continue to add more maps, more weapons and more gameplay to this if possible. Great job to all developers. üëèüëç","For a new ap lab game, I found this to be very entertaining. Sure it still needs a lot of work with the graphics and the mechanics, but it has some great potential for the future. I would like to see in the single-player game shootout, where the A.I. opponent continues to get faster and faster at the draw making it a real competition. Each round his draw should get a little faster and as long as you do not get shot by him, the competition continues with him speeding up and the challenge ends when you are shot. It would also be cool to have an A.I. competition in both the horseshoe and the knife stabbing contest. In the knife contest each round you win the next round the A.I. gets a little faster. In the horseshoe game each round you win the A.I. gets better at his aim. I look forward to ""Season Two"""
