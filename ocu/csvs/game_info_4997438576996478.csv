Flowborne VR - Biofeedback Breathing Meditation,"Flowborne VR is a meditative breathing game with biofeedback support that teaches a calming breathing style in an intuitive way. It was created by psychological scientists with stress reduction and deep relaxation in mind. Experience a memorable pilgrimage through soothing landscapes, allow yourself to let go and master the art of diaphragmatic breathing. In Flowborne VR, your breath is used as a game controller. The innovative biofeedback algorithm allows the virtual world to react to your breathing in real-time. Simply place the controller on your belly, take a deep breath and float along ancient paths in an enchanting world.",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,", Relaxation & Meditation",English,1.61,JRB-VR,JRB-VR,https://flowborne.com/,"Mar 31, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4997438576996478/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4997438576996478&r=1, https://flowborne.com/privacy/",Terms of Service,668.3 MB,🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈 Good for you & me 💫💫💫💫💫💫💫,So happy it's free and we could just try and it worked. Nice world they created for the neurofeedback.,"I've been using VR since 2016 and I attempt to try every meditation app for Quest and PCVR. I meditate daily and although I'm tolerant of apps that are rough around the edges I'm still fairly critical. Flowborne does an exceptional job helping you focus on your breath. It employs a novel breathing mechanic that forces you to breathe in a specific way in order to progress through a rendered landscape. The graphics are artful enough to promote a relaxing experience, but simple and sparse enough to ignore if you happen to bliss out. Neither the graphics or the sound design competes with the mechanic, thereby allowing you to focus on your breath to maximum benefit. And it's free. Flowborne has an abundance of content for you to return to if you enjoy the experience. They're giving away more content than they should if they hope to one day monetize the app IMHO. It's great. Grab it and use it.","I just got this app and tried my first 2 sessions on top of the tutorial which was extremely helpful in introducing how this app works and I’m already blown away on how amazingly beautiful, calming and relaxing everything is designed and put together. Often you need to spend more time playing a game, but this one is love at first try for me because the environment and music are extremely calming that for that alone deserved the ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ rating that I gave it. Can it be improved? Of course it can and while playing it there’s some that came to mind that I decided to stop playing and write this review before getting lost in the game. I don’t meditate regularly which I know I should and in the past I had tried a few meditation apps on my phone and what I found on those app that was extremely beneficial and helpful was the guided meditation to tell you when to breath in and breath out so that you can get the most out of the exercise rather than just breathing in and out without any direction whatsoever which I found myself doing while playing the game knowing that the longer I breath out the more I move forward which I know is not exactly the goal of this meditation app but I’m not sure if it’s human nature or just me to want to move forward as fast as I can to see the end. Which is really cool when you get to the end, but as calming and relaxing the environment and music are I’m missing the biggest benefit of the meditation and that’s the meditation itself because I’m too focused on just breathing in and out to continue moving forward and that’s why during the meditation I kept wishing if only there’s a subtle cue to tell you when to breath in and when to breath out that’ll be so perfect so that I won’t be taking any unnecessary more breathing or taking longer breathing in or out if there’s something to guide me in knowing when to take them and how long to get the most benefit of the meditation exercise to help those who are like me who are not well versed in meditation. Maybe even just add a level so beginners get guided meditations while experts can drive their own meditation since they’re already in control of their breathing. Aside from the guided breathing there’s one more thing that I’ve observed that can be somewhat distracting and that’s the continuous vibration from the controller which isn’t too bad but noticeable given that you’re in meditative state. Although I love the controllers vibrating in almost every other game, I find it quite distracting during meditation and I’m wondering if there’s any way to turn that off or if that’s what’s being used to signal the app when you’re breathing in and out and if it’s not used for that purpose I wish there’s an option to turn it off because it’s hard to ignore your controller vibrating as subtle as it is on your belly unless it’s being used to signal when to breath in and out like some meditation apps that I tried on my phone before then that would be completely acceptable but maybe change the vibration a bit to be more relaxing in a fluid motion so that it’s not as distracting. Again, these are just suggestions that I thought of while trying it out and wished these options were available to make this meditation even more epic since like I said, I already love this meditation app after only trying 2 complete sessions. A big shout out to the devs who really did a phenomenal job in putting this app together and making it available for free for everybody to enjoy. Thank you so much for all your hard work and exceptional creativity this is truly an amazing experience… THANK YOU… THANK YOU… THANK YOU… for this amazing meditation app and I’m truly looking forward to all the benefits this app has to offer for my well-being. 🥂","Really surprised i liked this as thought it would be too boring for my busy brain but I love it, and it feels really finely tuned so when you breath out reaaaaaally slowly you move more. It’s great thanks for making it !"
