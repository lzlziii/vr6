Symphony Of Motion,"Symphony Of Motion offers a new unique way to create and experience music without the need for any prior musical knowledge. Whether you're a seasoned musician or a complete beginner, this is a new and intuitive way to create and experience music. In its simplest form, you just move your hands around to create unique sounds, melodies, and rhythms. There are no “wrong” notes to worry about (as you always play in a specific scale) and you can always stay on perfect tempo with the build-in perfect timing assistant. For the more experienced musicians, it also offers a lot of customization options, a build-in looper, and new levels of expressional depth with its three-dimensional motion modulation, live pitch-shifting drums, and melodic pads.",3+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,"Creativity & Design, Productivity, Relaxation & Meditation",English,0.23,InstrumentalLeap,Instrumental Leap,http://www.fingerJam.dev/,"Jun 6, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4676896142409924/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4676896142409924&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTml4NDv2-HKPSFPSy9sA4DCRO54sd6Aadn_O17yHGtpq6fyjRE-wC6hGbjIDZ01MXtv24vk5wlBWL0/pub",Terms of Service,334.2 MB,"...to write a fair review of this app. Just know for now that it's a solid 5 stars. There is so much already here, and so much more potential. I will think on it and edit this review soon. Devs, in the meantime, is there any way to adjust the positioning of the drum kits? I couldn't find any way to do so thus far in my limited use of the app. I found my neck aching after not too long from looking down at the kits. (This, of course, was exacerbated by the headset pulling forward on my head.) It would be fantastic if there was a way to position the kits higher, directly in front of the user's upper chest and/or face.","ok, interesting experience, but feelings in touching objects are not really nice: i think i'm OK when i put my hand, but not always, you have to go a little back or further... Nevertheless, it can be a nice experience to beginners in VR, so for the moment, i'm satisfied and look at updates.","I bought this as a music creation app firstly. Now having been trying things out I am getting a good workout. You can make the synth like in a circle and move around playing notes. Touch a note, pull your controllers out and move them around and you get more sounds. According to the move I burnt 500 plus calories in 85 mins, not all at the same time. It is real fun and something different to move to. You can get exercise with the drums as well, especially the arms if required and sat if needed. Now don't go thinking that drums means the standard drums sounds, there is a good selection of weird and wonderful sounds you can find with experiment. You can move the sounds around and overlap others to get loads of other different sounds. The choice of sound are so vast in both of them it's a music and sound playground you could spend hours just messing around with no intention of doing any loops. To be fair I do both, when I want to relax I will try build a tune, then at times I just want to move and get some energy out.","Video review: https://youtu.be/blMtcx4YRDQ The Symphony of Motion app (early access as of the time of this review) allows you to create music tracks without any prior musical background using your body movements in virtual reality. You can create your own original music track by layering loop tracks of synth and drums, using the music looper tool. You can then save and export it as a "".wave"" file. Symphony of Motion gives you the ability to interact with virtual objects by using various hand gestures, positions, and rotations to produce original sounds. This music creation VR app will make sure your music is in rhythm by turning on the perfect time option. Many more options include controlling the loop tracks' volume, choosing different drum setups, customizing the drum pad locations, and much more. It's a genius idea that is perfect for virtual reality, as it enables music creators, be they beginners or experienced, to create unique sounds in the way they interact with virtual objects, using different hand movements. You can therefore create a large variety of sounds with only a small selection of objects and control everything using unique body movement interactions. The UI still needs a bit of work, especially the delete option, which I struggled with, but overall, a very accessible and easy-to-use music creation tool. It might look intimidating at first, but trust me, in a few minutes, you'll be rocking some amazing tracks and you'll be vibing to your own original tracks! Highly Recommended!"
