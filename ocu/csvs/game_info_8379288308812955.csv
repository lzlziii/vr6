( i have Discord if u want Adxr08#9898,I won't abuse. I will follow the rules. I won't false kick or ban. I will be kind to everyone. I will make sure no one some how gets out the map or does very bad glitches. Overall this is a really cool game and I recommend people should play it. -Cooldude4213,I would very much like to be mod. If I was mod I would be liked by the ppl and I wouldnâ€™t abuse power. I would obey the rules. I have strong faith with god so I might have mixed thoughts about the homosexual lifestyle of ppl but I would let them be and not interfere unless necessary. Please make me mod. Like please.,I like this game and itâ€™s fun but the monke model is just not the best thatâ€™s all,Every single moderator kicks me a lot and I want to become mod so plsssssss
