Every time I tried to turn around, I was teleporting all over the place. It made me so sick. Please, for the love of God, give us the option to walk normal in there. I had fun with the games, but you need to be able to turn that off.","Had alot of fun playing with a group of friends, played uno and a word game. I do like the name hangout games better it is more fitting of what this game is. This is a well polished fun game to hang out with friends. We had a blast","Have only played VRUNO so far. Private game worked seamlessly. Gameplay was flawless! (Didn't figure out the dance party, but that's an added bonus, so didn't impact gameplay) Will defiintely support you, Devs, in building your new library! Nicely done and Thank You!",I love this game five stars but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø·µê·µÉ ∏·µá·µâ add a little more games üéÆ and the game copycat is my üòç fav and themode we're you write it yourself is so cool but then people write really inappropriate stuff that I do not want to draw if you could pls üôè remove that I would be greatful if you consider my offer Ÿ©(‡¥∞ÃÄ·¥ó‡¥∞ÃÅ)·µá ∏·µâ thank ‚ù§ you ‚ù§,I'd tried many times to play this but never found anyone on. Finally found some people and it was great fun. My girlfriend saw me playing and wanted to try which is high praise as I can get her to try something in VR once in a blue moon. Her seeing me play this game had her trying it on her own. Can't wait to see what else y'all add
