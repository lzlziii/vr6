There is a steep learning curve, but lots of people who are willing to give you tips along the way. Update: The latest update ""Hostile Conditions"" took this game to a whole new level! This has set the bar extremely high for every other vr game to come. There simply isn't a better, more immersive experience available on the quest platform!",I started playing this game after watching a great YT video review. I was searching for a multiplayer shooter with voice communication that didn't give me motion sickness and found this. It's a ton of fun and has excellent motion physics. It's now the only game I play and I never get bored with it. It's challenging and the other players are normally PG friendly. I highly recommend this game.,"I'm happy to see that the developers continue to support this game. I just love it! The sensation of piloting the grinder is unique. I love Iron Rebellion but this game is totaly different. Either way, I'm happy for being playing it once again. The skirmishes are a ton of fun! Keep the good work!","The downgrade from its PC counterpart is well executed and it keeps the amazing mech physics that is the strength of this game. I‚Äôll review the Campaign not the Multiplayer mode. The introduction to the game mechanics and to the universe in the early game is good but slow. What really helps is the amount of details that are shown through the mech cockpit and the security ship. The charters design and voice acting are fair. Now the shortcomings list: The characters animation is buggy and/or horrible, the interaction with the environment and characters is almost non-existent, the missions levels and types are all over the place. Finally the engagement toward the story is buried under these issues and feels rushed. There is a lot of potential here and they have a lot of character dialogue that needs to come forward. I hope that the Space Bullet Dynamics Corporation will revisit and improve the campaign with a longueur, better defined and showcasing their work on this project. Till then this is my rating for the campaign.",It‚Äôs the most fun detailed long game that you will be playing for a while some people even played like 4 years! it‚Äôs so fun to do the campaign trust me the rewards for completing it are so worth it I would totally recommend this game tho the one thing is that the graphics from pc and quest are way different pc vr has better graphics but quest isn‚Äôt that bad you won‚Äôt even notice the difference also there community it‚Äôs really nice I met someone named like votine something like that he taught me a lot about the game so don‚Äôt be nervous to ask the community anything about the game. You should definitely but the game it‚Äôs very fun in my opinionüëç
