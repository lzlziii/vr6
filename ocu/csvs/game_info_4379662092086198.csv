Plush Madness,"A summoning has gone wrong.Now the house and all plushies are possessed. Can you make it through the maze, activate all symbols and defeat the demon? Plush Madness is a Horror Fighting Game optimized for VR and playable for Flatscreen too. In every room, you'll see plushies trying to attack you. You can pick them up, rip them apart or just hit them and make them fly. You'll have to activate the symbols in the correct order to open the last door in the basement. There is a Time Limit on your hands. Whenever you defeat a plushie, the timer is incremented. Can you make it to the end without running out of time?",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Gamepad","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Fighting, Horror","English, French (France), German, Italian, Spanish (Spain)",8,Rhine Games,Rhine Games,https://rhinegames.com/,"Aug 26, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4379662092086198/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4379662092086198&r=1, https://rhinegames.com/privacypolicy/plushmadness.html",Terms of Service,368.5 MB,There is not a lot you can do other than punch or pull apart the plushies. The enemies go down very quickly. There is also no progress in the gameâ€¦ you move between the same rooms where you easily defeat the same stuffys over and over. My kids grew tired of this game in very short order and they were super excited to play it. Disappointing
