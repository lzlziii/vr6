My only complain is that is lacking a infinite survival mode. Just put an arena where you can move around and people coming from different directions. It would be great!,This game gives the feeling of trading fire from cover better than any other game ever made! This is Time Crisis + Police 911!,"Why is this game not on the main store already? 2 target ranges, 8 missions, 3 difficulty levels, 6 guns to tweak the difficulty further, and internet leaderboards for every combination, including dual-wielding different weapons. The only thing missing are local leaderboards like Pistol Whip has. You can tweak hertz up to 120 or render quality (I assume resolution) to 150%. Flat textures a la Walkabout, but like Walkabout, I love how it feels like you're traversing through an actual environment and not just static areas. Fantastic VR representation of the light gun genre. I love the little touches like the enemies reacting to people getting shot near them.","Nice game need more jobs ,weapons and change of environment.","Dead second is an amazing game with a strong arcade vibe.The simplicity of the game belies its brilliance! Intuitive controls and elegant handling, in addition to solid graphics and attention to detail. Dead second employees a teleport style movement system, but it’s one that works and doesn’t feel clunky. Both peogression and weapon handling feel very satisfying. If your looking for a VR shooter where you can just jump in and start having fun this is one for you. Five stars!"
