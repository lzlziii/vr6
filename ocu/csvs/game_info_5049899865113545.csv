Belmarsh VR,"Since April 2019, journalist Julian Assange has been a political prisoner in a solitary cell in Belmarsh Maximum Security Prison in the Thamesmead district of the Royal Borough of Greenwich in the British capital London. We have recreated this cell visually and acoustically as close as possible, so that everyone can experience first-hand what isolation and psychological torment mean. We hope that with this project we will reach more people who are campaigning for the release of Julian Assange. Just sharing this app with more Oculus users can make all the difference.
