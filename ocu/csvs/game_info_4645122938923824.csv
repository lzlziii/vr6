As a novice piano player, I found the lessons informative and simple. The instructor has a charming accent, and his passion for teaching the piano show through. Iâ€™m only on the first lesson, and have filled in many of the gaps, that my self-teaching method left. With good lighting, your own hands are responsive as controllers. The piano itself is a little too sensitive for me, but that may improve as I get better. Truly the value of this app, far surpasses the $5 cost."
