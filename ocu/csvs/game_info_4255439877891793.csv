And this is the only thing close enough to scratch that itch if your willing to be a little imaginative. Its a demo and it cant have you expecting much, but for it being free its a d*mn good experience and one you can easily get lost in by being your favorite superhero or one you get to create with is multiple power options.","I only just got this game about 10 minutes ago and let me tell you that this game may possibly be one of the best VR superhero games of all time! Iâ€™ve really only used the spiderman powers so far, but I have tried the others and they are fantastic as well, I would would 100% try out this game because of how good it is.","This game has the perfect amount of a mix between brutality and action. over the past couple months I have owned this demo, it has been the only game that I have played until my battery has ran out. I would highly recommend, and I am saving up for the full game.","Dear Developer, I decided to give your game one last shot and it was amazing! It was SO MUCH FUN, but I ran into some bugs and frustrating parts. However, I know that's just because it's a demo, so no worries there. I just wanted to say that I LOVE YOUR GAME and I can't wait to see the final product! Keep up the great work! Best regards, Player","I love this game and it is still the demo so I am excited to see the full game powers there are. Obviously it is a demo so any complaints I have would of probably been fixed in the full game but I think the swords and stabbing are a bit weird. However, I trust that the full game will be amazing so I am very interested in saving up"
