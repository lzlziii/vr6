Cueist 2,"The sequel to the popular Cueist pool/snooker game, Cueist 2 brings unparalelled realism to online VR cue sports. This is not a casual point and click type game, but a deeper simulation which will reward real skill. - Play online against your friends with voice chat and Meta Avatars or get some practice in versus the CPU players. - Use a natural cueing action using the Touch Controllers, or attach a real cue for the ultimate in feel and accuracy. - A choice of specialist cues enables various spin, swerve, masse, and jump shots. - Choose between 9 Ball, 8 Ball, UK 8 Ball, and Snooker. The latest update adds: - Click the left thumbstick to switch between smooth movement and stepped movement (for those who might find smooth movement unsettling) - Click the right thumbstick to switch between smooth rotation and snap turns. - A new laser aim pointer to aid lining up shots - When the shot is lined up, you can nowhold the Y button on the left controller to enable Autoplay",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Sports,English,1.17,Saitara Software,Saitara Software,https://www.saitarasoft.com/,"Mar 21, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/7050023918401347/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=7050023918401347&r=1, https://www.saitarasoft.com/privacy",319.6 MB,To this date. I think this is the only vr game which have snooker on it. I've been searching for ages. I bought it for playing snooker and it's good. Better if the table is full size. Or already give the option for the full size or smaller one. I hope there's a way to remove the ghost ball too. I just need the aim guideline. Playing against the Snooker AI too is not that good though. I hope the snooker AI Herts improved upon too. I play Vs myself and it's pretty fun though. There is multiplayer but have yet to see someone playing online to play with. I hope it continues to gets updated also.ðŸ˜‰,"For the price, this pool shooter offers a good variety of game play and options. The Cueist 2 table option is too fast and needs to be slowed down some. The Snooker table is not a full scale Snooker table. It would be nice if they included tutorials on how to play the various games. Multiplayer mode needs to be worked on for better connection with other players.","Seems good, and good value but would be even better if snooker table was full size and could have a smooth rotation. Otherwise all other features are excellent, thanks.","Tried a few pool games in the past and didn't really enjoy the experience. This was the best I have tried so far, but it isn't just quite there yet and needs work in some areas. Other have said that the balls run too quick and indeed they do. However tournament tables do play quicker then tables the normal person plays on. But still I did a scr** shot not too hard, enough to stun it a little and slight return and if flew around the table. Rising the table to preferred height is easy, but for me too easy to accidentally change it while turning. Had a few glitches with doing a gentle shot and it going like I had hit it full pelt. The hand position seemed a lot better/more natural then other games I have tried. Getting the right shot can be a pain as no aim to show angle, you press grip on left controller to see that. If you need to adjust shot, you release the grip button and move cue how you think it should be, press the grip button to see shot. Can be finicky, though I expect I might need more practice as well. For the price it is worth having, but would be so much better if the physics was balanced a little bit.","I'm really impressed with this so far. I'd really like to try using a real cue but I can't find any information on how to do it. Also, I wonder if hand tracking can ever be incorporated? Please tell me how to use a real cue! Thanks"
