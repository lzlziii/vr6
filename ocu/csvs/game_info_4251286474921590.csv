It would to nice to change volume between engine sound and music, also racing other cars but maybe it's to much for the quest to do, anyway I'm playing a racing game in VR on the quest brilliant! Ps only Â£4.49.","1. The automatic cars do not downshift soon enough when you let go of the throttle and turn, causing the car to have low acceleration once you engage the throttle again. 2. Needs an options menu to tweak sound effect volume and music volume. 3. Sometimes you don't get coins when completing a time-attack race. Other than that, I love the game and love the handling model.","Been awhile this game has to update ""for now"" is now. Dont waste money good concept though bad follow through.","I enjoyed the look of the game, the choices one can make and the different cars you can choose from, BUT... This is 2022 and no one born after 1975 has learned how to drive a stick shift and YOU give NO instructions on how to. I'm pushing 60 and NEVER in my life did I have to learn or even want/need to learn how to drive a manual car. The majority of your game players are going to be under the age of 25 and might not have ever seen a manual transmission! I know there are a few automatic transmissions but you first have to actually earn money driving the cars to get that cash, and that can take a LONG time to get up to the money needed for an automatic. I fought with the first car you get for a while but was able to buy the Corvette. The first car I had NO trouble handling and keeping it on the road. Once I got it up to full speed I never let off the gas and topped it out at 210 mph and never crashed, I Did the track in 1:11:00 That may not sound great but for a guy who has NO idea how to drive a stick, I am proud. I got in the Corvette and the second I touched the gas the car was OFF the road. It had NO control as the first car did. Ended up on a guard rail shortly into the run and was struck. No matter where you are in the world, you should have been able to hear me swear! I think you should allow automatic cars right from the beginning and not have to earn 7 grand or more to buy one. I wasted 4 grand on a corvette so getting up to 7 grand again will take a lot of time and anger.","The mechanics and everything is fine, but like most people said, the shifter isn't very intuitive, doesn't have any feedback and slides around a lot, making you look at the gear shifter and crash. Other than that an awesome game, would be infinitely better and a definite hit if it included multi-player"
