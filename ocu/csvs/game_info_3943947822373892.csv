Masternoid Demo,"Masternoid is a pure arcade brick breaker, reimagined for the age of VR. Immerse yourself in a bright and colorful world, embrace the meditative power of destruction and ascend to the top of the leaderboards like a true arcade legend. The full game features 50 levels of voxel goodness and an original soundtrack that adapts to the gameplay. You can enjoy the game seated or standing, as minimal physical effort and space is required to play. You only need one controller - right or left hand it is up to you - and one button to shoot and re-bounce the ball.
