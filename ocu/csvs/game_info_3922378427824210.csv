Great community of regulars who I have come to admire and respect for their flying abilities and fair play without drama. Developers‚Ä¶please, please, please‚Ä¶create a Flares only team death-match. Also‚Ä¶a new map of a ww1 city to fly around during Flare mayhem is the most requested new aspect from all the regulars. We seem to be losing people and a new map, would breathe new life into this amazing game! Thanks, Vin Fiz Vortex","Best game that I own. This game really recreates WWI and it‚Äôs planes. It is the most realistic you can get with a VR flying game. There is a variety of different WWI planes and they all have different aspects. The concept is simple: destroy the enemy aircraft or zeppelin without getting shot down. Also, the controls are very easy to get used to. Depending on the game mode that you are playing on, you get more money (to spend on planes or upgrades) and it gets harder to play. Example: if you play on realistic mode, then there is a +30% money increase and it‚Äôs easy to fly the plane and there is a marking on top of each plane to tell you which one is the enemy. But if you play the Real War mode, then its a +110% money increase but it‚Äôs way harder to fly the plane and you have to identify the enemy planes by there paint jobs. I definitely recommend this game to anyone, but mostly the people who always have wanted to fly a plane. Definitely get.",I am obsessed with flying and tho I'm so afraid of heights and would prob never Eben fly in a real plane being I haven't before and I'm 36 years old lolol this about does it for me and it gives me the satisfaction. My gosh It seems so real. If ur into flying games and want it save yourself money and go to l i n k t r period ee slash mr12gage330 and check out others as well there's a bunch. Just make sure words are all together and not separate lol,This is genuinely a good game. The different planes and levels make for a lot of playtime. And all for a good price. Definitely a buy üëç 25 off: bit(dot)ly/OculusDisc Replace the (dot) with a period Please liek the post it really helps!!!,"My 70 year old dad has never enjoyed video games, but I had him try playing thos game, and he got hooked. The only thing I don't like about the game is that I get motion sickness if I play too long."
