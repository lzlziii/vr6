Especially the cloudy one where you cant even see where you're supposed to throw. Get the other disc golf game instead even the the physics in that one aren't quite as good, the courses in that game are actually fun to play. The best thing about this game is the driving range which is pretty fun but you can play that in the demo. Full game feels like a RIP off.",Only thing I would like more is easier to throw short and long distance with like a power meter or something because throws are a little inaccurate but overall great game Ps. Also add custom maps so everyone can create and play everybody's created courses and free or paid dlc if you would like,"Yes I too like this game but per the games discord the Dev has indefinitely stopped working on this which is unfortunate. If you want to pay for a game that won't be updated that's up to you, it's fun but no bug will get worked out every again. It's a good game. Playability will be limited so choose wisely. 2 stars for great gameplay.","The devs of this game have done an amazing job on the mechanics of throwing a disc in VR. It’s not easy, but does allow for shot shaping. I’ve gotten a lot better with practice, and successfully executing a shot is very rewarding. You can tell the devs have a true passion for disc golf from the attention to details. This game does need more courses and discs imho. I would happily pay for more! I love supporting amazing devs who you can tell really care about and enjoy disc golf.",Whoever runs the discord is a sensitive d-bagg I hate I bought this game don't do it. He kept kicking me out cause I said the multiplayer is trash and still is. Also there is no goal to reach in this game it gets boring quick but all the people who said that guy is a d-bagg are spot on
