One of the best horror games I’ve ever played,"I have owned the Oculus Quest and Quest 2 since they both released and have not wrote a single review for any game on them. Project Terminus is an exception because of how passionately loved it is. Let me get into it. First, the bugs. I see a lot of people addressing the French reading in some of the servers. Though, if you have any tuition at all, you can get through it pretty easily. Not that it isn’t a problem, but it is definitely not as big as other people made it out to be. This is the only “major” bug I have seen people address multiple times, but I think it was just overlooked. I have also seen people review the game say that they’ve encountered multiple bugs but don’t specify. Me and my friend may have just been lucky, but we didn’t encounter a single bug. HORROR: The game was flawless start to end (we played on quest 2’s). And the game itself… oh my god. The details and atmosphere it establishes from the start immerse you so quickly. Others say the game is not scary, but this is the only VR horror game that made me have to build up courage with my buddy to book out a single door to run to the exit. If you want horror, it’s here. Not only that, but a whole COOP narrative- which is a very rare occurance. I just love how this game was made for more than one person, if you hear a can drop, everyone else will too. The sounds in this game are so truly convincing and put you on edge the entire time. Gameplay: This game was very good with the details. If you wanted to run you had to swing your arms. If you swing at the screen it’s gonna break and make noise. If you want to remember a map, take a picture of it with your phone. All of these things are on the game. It diversifies it’s so much and make a huge difference that I haven’t seen in many titles. And again, there’s coop that works flawlessly. I played the game with a friend and we both were terrified together ;) (and the graphics were absolutely stunning, 8.5/10 for quest games!) Story: honestly it’s a pretty simple story. nukes, zombies, all that. but what makes it stand out is how they never leave out a single detail or take you out of the moment for a cutscene, because the game treats you like the cutscene. For example, there was a part of the game where you run into doctors who all look the same with name tags. But they all had a different name?? On those tags. That’s one of the smallest details I’ve seen in a quest 2 game that was so unnecessary but so immersive! Another example is the action. I won’t spoil it but there were so many moments when I thought the screen would just black out and make sounds (as most vr games do to signify you made it to another area) but no. The only way I could say anything without spoiling is you are quite literally doing everything! It’s so freaking cool. The time and effort to not have a preloaded cutscene on a quest 2 game is very amendable. Something short- but the developers are so cool. They’re always talking in their discord and paying attention to bugs people are posting and being so open about everything they do. I love this game. I really do think everyone should try it (oh and it has a demo so you can!), and i am so excited for the next act. thanks CVR <3 TL;DR: you should try it. It has a demo. I love this games multiplayer but that’s all I can recommend since that is how I played it. edit: just finished act 2, extremely buggy.","Wow such a cool start , game looks and plays great , update this is by far my favorite multiplayer game and is brilliant in solo as well , fabulous story great suspense and action it's become my top 5 game and I own a ton of games it's just that fantastic . Can't wait for act 3 to drop as well.","The game is amazing and me and my friends has been playing the game for a while now but, the mall chapter is really annoying. The game isn't fun in that part you just shoot a wave of zombies for like 25 minuets. Not just that the game at that part has been really buggy like, ammo not spawning or glitching out of the map, so you have to restart the game.",I have been playing this game for a while and I think it's a really good game. However every single time I play this game with Friends there's some type of glitching. One minute the game is fine for a while then start glitching out. The next it's impossible to connect with other players. This has been going on since the launch of this game.
