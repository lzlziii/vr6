Recombination,"Recombination is the latest project from visionary fractal artist Julius Horsthuis. In order to create an immersive album, he collaborated with Michael Stearns, Max Cooper, Desert Dwellers, Ott and others in order to create an abstract journey through music, space and mathematics. In order to get the most out of the hardware‚Äôs capabilities, Julius rendered the album in the highest possible resolution. The details in the fractals need to be experienced fully, therefor, we decided to make this album downloadable only, so it can‚Äôt be streamed. This means that patience and fast internet are required. But we promise it will be worth your time. Once your favorite track (or the entire album) is downloaded, find your ultimate seat, connect your best headphones, and visit another universe.",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Entertainment,", Experimental, Music, Space & Universe",English,1.0.3,Germans Media Technology & Services,Recombination VR,https://www.recombinationvr.com/,"Mar 9, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6047388498631770/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6047388498631770&r=1, https://www.recombinationvr.com/privacy",256.7 MB,"For what it is (given the lengths you must go to in order to otherwise see fractals like this), this is like a ""businessman's trip"" if you want to see the beauty of math and fractals without the risk. That being said, I hope for more content like this, hopefully an updated or second version for the quest 3.","Guess my expectations where too high (as I really like psychedelic fractals accompanied with interesting experimental music) but although I love the overall experience its a little too expensive in my view (and the smoothness of the (downloaded) video is not up to par here and there, but overall pretty good). So therefore not the full amount ;)","This is a collection of 8 pre-rendered VR180 videos of 3D fractals by fractal artist Julius Horsthuis. Each video is accompanied by an electronic music track, but there is only the most basic of synchronization with the music. The videos range in length from about 3 minutes to 6 minutes. The viewing angle seems to be slightly offset, so you get about 80 degrees in one direction and 100 degrees in the other; this can help give the impression the videos are more than 180 degrees provided you look around in the right direction. I believe Horsthuis uses the program Mandelbulb 3D to generate these. You can get a good taste by finding similar videos on Youtube, including ones by Horsthuis, but in a lower resolution (4K, while I think this app uses 8K). Use YouTube VR and search for ‚Äúmandelbulb VR180‚Äù. It‚Äôs worth doing that to get an idea of what you are getting here. 3D fractals are very trippy. Sometimes they‚Äôre almost creepy. In addition, the evolving fractal and camera movement could cause some motion sickness in those prone to it. While these videos are great, its hard to recommend this app at the price. I think it would have made more sense for the app to be free and have samples of each, and sell the individual videos separately as DLC. That would give people a better idea of what they are getting and open up the app to those who may be interested but not $40 interested.

I was totally transfixrd. The closest I've come to a DMT experience in a headset. Simply beautiful beyond words. Wonderful music as well. Only criticism I could level at this masterpiece is that I wanted to be MORE submerged. I wanted to touch, eat and breath the fractals, cover my skin and swim. Amazing, Julius! Give me MORE! üíú‚òÆüíú","Knowing the limitations of the Quest and the high percentage of people who rarely look behind them in 360 environments, Julius made the right choice in opting for super high quality 180 3D. This music album of high quality fractals and the way they are navigated really is one of those top VR video experiences! At roughly a buck a minute here in Canada, except for a couple of selections I think this is well worth having in my collection of things to trip out on between other moments of inhabiting VR. Finally, a chance to own first generation quality 3D fractals, often seen on YouTube but never as crisp and smooth as this collection is produced. Congratulations to the team, always loved your work Mr. Horsthuis!!"
