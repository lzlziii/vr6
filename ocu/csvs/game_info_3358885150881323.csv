Alien Squatters,"The aliens have landed! And they've taken over our houses, buildings, and monuments. Well, if we can't have 'em, neither can they! Use your trusty rocket launcher to destroy the buildings they're squatting in. When they try and fly away in their UFOs, blow them out of the sky! There are five UFOs per level. Once you've completed all the levels, play again, but now your rocket launcher will have increased fire rate, and the UFOs will be faster. Quitting the game will reset your play-thru count. Use the trigger to fire rockets - hold it down for maximum fire rate. Use the menu button to reload a scene, quit the game, or switch handedness.

I think it has a lot of potential as a kid friendly game, you shoot but nothing shoots back or comes towards you. Things I'd like to see.. Making most things destructible. More weapons, could even be found when destroying objects. More ""enemies"" Maybe even a timer Can even include a story mode or rpg where you need to walk around the map."
