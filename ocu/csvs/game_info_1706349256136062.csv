If you are considering purchasing this game (or others on Quest) click on my pic and then “chat” to DM me as I can help reduce the price you pay. (See the end of my review for more help). This game is amazing and I do hope my review convinces you to give it a try. I am shocked at how few people have heard of it. It is simply a top notch game! It is very underrated in my humble view. This is a survival horror game and features almost comic like graphics which actually adds to the atmosphere. The game requires dexterity and almost a 6th sense as the story leads you from one scary scene to another. It is a game that is easy to start to play but takes a fair bit of practice to master. I spent hours and hours playing this game - the story was interesting and engaging, the skills you will need step up section by section as the game gets harder & harder, there are jump scares and serious foes to overcome. There were two spots in this game that really took some time for me to get through - you really have to be careful, plan well & be precise in your moves to survive. The combination of extraordinary graphics, demanding play and great (and long) story give an incredible game for a very reasonable price. I really really recommend this game - it’s a quiet little winner! If my review assisted consider selecting the “helpful button.

I beat this game last year and I can say that this is the best horror game on the quest. I shat myself at least 30 times. The gameplay is amazing, The art style is EXTRAORDINARY, it’s like your in a comic book. And the mechanics are amazing. Every VR gamer that is into any type of horror needs this game. 10/10","Most games that I've played on the quest feel like the developers were making the games for stronger headsets and the quest 2 version was an after thought. The first game I played that felt like a true quest 2 game was resident evil 4 and that game blew my mind. The second game I played that felt like a true quest 2 game was this one. This game is a premium quest experience and a must buy, I felt the quality of the game the minute I started playing it.",This was the First quest game that gave me an oclur migraine. Never had one until playing this game. If you never had one its basically blurred vision and crazy lines in your peripheral vision. Sure it doesn't happen with everyone. guess I'm one of the lucky ones;) what I played seemed alright,"God, this game is a must buy for enjoyers of horror and shooters. The story is amazingly told through the environment, scares, and comic-flipping cutscenes. The environments are beautifully decrepit and terrifying to saunter through, with high quality finds that give your playthrough a great spark that will keep you surviving through this nightmare your character experiences. The cel-shading blends well with the horror, the scares are sprinkled evenly without over-use, and the engaging and action-packed gameplay will keep you hooked. My compliments are endless for this masterpiece. This game got me back into horror games and I cannot wait for Drifter Entertainment’s next venture, given how fantastic this first foray is into VR horror. They’ve made a bang with this entrance, and I know it’ll echo through whatever they make next."
