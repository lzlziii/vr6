Lau Gar as a teenager, up to my current age of 59, currently being traditional IP Man Wing Chun. With extensive training and participating in National Competitions against other Martial Artists.. So far, I am impressed with what the devs have done on creating this software - Training, Fighting, Training Rooms (we don’t say Dojo, that’s Karate) and the Wing Chun Wooden Dummy. Be interesting to see how far this can go. If you’re a beginner, this will be a great training aid, along with your club lessons, in which you should keep attending. For me just starting to use this software, slow initially but now, 24hrs after downloading it, I’m finding it an excellent training aid. Lessons are good, teaching how to block, duck and punch. As for the fighting area, even Level 1 gives you a good workout; with multiple punches, blocking, ducking/stepping back and the way the fighting column moves up and down. A real workout. Just make sure you have enough room to move about. Oh, and a towel to dry off with ;) The Wing Chun Dummy is good. Teaching you how to punch without touching the arms. Shame we can’t use our legs to complete the Wooden Dummy Form. Just remember one important aspect of Martial Arts. Levels and Grading (belts) don’t make you great, anyone can wear a belt. Technique, speed and reading your opponent’s intentions before they attack make you good. This could be a great journey. Let’s go :) It’s June, you can remove the Christmas Tree and Gifts. The lantern can stay (thumbs up!)","I don't often keep games I buy and am very, very picky. This game is an obvious keeper for me because it can provide an intense workout that won't injure me as much as, say, Thrill of the Fight (the greatest game ever). This game is more about precision and speed than explosive movements, and serves as a nice complement. I will come back to it often because it definitely feels awesome when you get in the zone and are slapping away a barrage of sticks and pads. Important: the game will feel frustrating at first. Just sleep on it and come back a few times. Your brain will figure it out for you. EDIT: The new fight mode with the full release is super exhausting. Great workout.","25 off for the VR homies: b i t , l y / c r a z y k u n g f u v r (comma is a period and remove all spaces) This game is incredibly satisfying and also a great workout. If martial arts interest you at all you will likely love this game. The game play mechanics are well thought out and the feedback when punching something is spot on. Everything in combination makes for a really nice experience and after beating a difficult level you will literally throw your hands up in victory. Definite buy, great addition to my library.","bio DOT link / spearzoz Here's the link to get 3.75$ OFF if you want to buy this game (make sure to remove all spaces and replace ""DOT"" with the dot character). Go to the link and select the game you wish. We'll both benefit from it because of Meta's promotion! I'd really appreciate a thumbs up if you found useful the previous link or the following review. =) Here's my review ^-^ Crazy Kung Fu is an intense VR workout game that brings martial arts training to life with realistic physics-based gameplay. Punching wooden boards requires genuine force, making it an engaging challenge. The fast-paced action and physical demands create an addictive experience. Tracking scores and physical improvements add value as a fitness tool. However, limited gameplay variety might lead to repetitiveness. Preparation is crucial, requiring ample space for movement. It offers a cardio workout with a 9/10 intensity, targeting arms and core strength. High replayability due to the challenging nature. While lacking social multiplayer, Crazy Kung Fu provides a unique and rewarding fitness experience. Whether you're a fitness enthusiast or a VR gaming fan, Crazy Kung Fu delivers a thrilling and immersive training experience.","Learn to be (or at least feel like) a Kung fu master - in your own home! Or in the pretty scenes available in the game if you prefer. Absolutely worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot and remove spaces): b i t , l y / c k f"
