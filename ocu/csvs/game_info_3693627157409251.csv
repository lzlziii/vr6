Classic Hitter,This is a skill and music game where you hit the incoming targets. Each target plays a note which builds up into a recognisable classical tune. From the relaxing Greensleeves to hectic Flight of the Bumblebee. The notes are represented by 3D objects such as a chick or a bee. Relax and unwind to some classic tunes and test your musical ability. Try varying the timing such as adding a swing beat. ,3+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Music",English,0.6,P Bird,Marjupi Games,https://paulsvr.blogspot.com/,"Mar 31, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3693627157409251/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3693627157409251&r=1, https://paulsvr.blogspot.com/p/privacy-policy.html",39.9 MB,"When there's similar experiences like Beat Saber and Synth Riders, it's hard not to compare. Trying to be fair though and just rate the game as ""how did I enjoy this as a free experience."" Graphics obviously could use a lot of polish, but for a free game from a solo developer, that can be admittedly be really tough to invest time in. If the controls felt spot-on, I probably could give the graphics a pass. Something about the spacing of the notes and hit boxes on the mallets felt slightly off. When trying to play a dead-on piece of music, that can really throw off the whole experience. It might have helped to be able to adjust the length, angle, and size of the mallets coming out of the controllers, or to make the notes slightly larger. A light backing track would have been really nice to keep tempo/vibe going between notes. Hope the developer continues on this or other VR projects though because I can see the potential! :)",How can anyone say this is relaxing? Bet they have not tried flight of the bumblebee. Great workout Reminds me slightly of smash drums. But in a more basic way. Very enjoyable time waster. Could not find a highest score list section,You will recognise most of these tunes.
