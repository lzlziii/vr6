I wish there were instructions on how it scores the points and tracks high scores. I would give it 5 stars if it kept track of the scores and had instructions. Thanks,"I like the concept, popping bubbles before time runs out. Graphics are nicely done. Keep an eye on this one. Devs-add a tutorial. I’m not sure if it’s missing mechanics or it’s there but it’s not obvious to the casual user. There should be a way to see the next color it’s about to shoot so we can plan the next shot. Right now it seems to be random color changes and doesn’t make sense. Also when you get to the end and there’s only one color left your not allowed to pop them and always run out of time even though all bubbles are popped. (Back to mechanic not obvious)",A how-to or a video demo would be nice because i have no idea what i should do. Some bubbles are changing colour but I don't understand the pattern.,Don't take anymore of the vaccine kills people Why do I need to be online inorder to play
