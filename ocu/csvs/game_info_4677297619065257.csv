I can remove all labels and just gaze at the whole night sky and then point at any feature to get the information. Or I can learn a handful of stars or constellations at a time and then test myself with the sky at different orientations - clever. I can see myself studying a little at a time, putting it into real world use and then studying a little more. Been crying out for a planetarium in VR (Homestar just doesn't do it for me) and here it is. I've always used Stellarium as my default star app and it's nice to see the same illustrations. Thanks, dev!","I know nothing about the stars or galaxy, but I'm looking forward to learning about them from this game. There are so many settings to use to see the night sky as upu wish. Just look in ah, or play some learning games if you like. If you wish to learn more about the stars and the galaxy, then this is for you."
