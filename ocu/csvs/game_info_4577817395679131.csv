SaVR,"The year is 2121. Humans have colonised various planets in the solar system. This has caught the eye of a mysterious alien species who wish to enslave the humans and turn them into killing machines by kidnapping them up and reprogramming them. The humans on the each planet are under threat! You are the SAVR (pronounced 'Savior') - Sentient Autonomous Virtual Robot, a hi-tech drone controlled virtually from earth using quantum entanglement communication whose mission is to save all the humanoids on the planet before they are enslaved by the aliens. You must pick up all the humans and destroy all the aliens in each zone before moving to the next set of humans in peril.
