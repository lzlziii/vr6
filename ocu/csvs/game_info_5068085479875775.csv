I only played for 30 minutes. There is nothing to click to refund. Not a good experience. The refund instructions do not work. There is no option to refund.

It‚Äôs just like how it is in real life. 10/10 gameüôèüèºüéâ",It‚Äôs not the best game but if I could choose one get the nfl pro era,I purchased this game on Sunday the 26th of March 2023 I read the reviews and they even though they weren't really flattering I said I'm going to give this game a chance it can't be that bad cuz people still say they like it well I like the game but it has a lot of glitch issues I'll be playing the game and it'll just go screen or get blotchy first I thought it was my headset but it didn't do it on any other game please I beg of you to fix the glitches..... I am retired and try to do my exercises and move around with these games and I can't afford to waste money because I live on a budget so I beg of you once again game programmers to please fix this game so that I can enjoy it the way it was meant to be.... At this point in time if a friend asked me do I recommend this game No to the No No No save your money I wish I did!!!,I hate when the game crashes and glitches and for some reason all my wide receivers run out of bounds and never run there routes the creators need to fix this and make updates!
