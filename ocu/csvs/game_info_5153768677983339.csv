It takes the already solid concept of tower defense and adds an entire new layer of fun on top of it thanks to VR’centeic interactions. Your controller is a “drone” flying around a map. You shoot enemies while setting up the various turrets, adding a real time anxious-action / think-fast strategizing to the genre. I loved it. The second half of the game got decently hard, in a good way. It was a rewarding challenge.","If you’re a fan of tower defence games then this is a must. Even if you haven’t played one, give this a go as it’s brilliantly put together, very polished and great fun to play. The difficulty curve is pitched really well and beating the levels is very satisfying. There are plenty of strategies you can use and there’s no single way to win. It’s even really well priced, what’s not to love?! Great job Devs, really enjoying this gem, hope there might be a follow up in the works.",A traditional tower defense game in the same vein as Defense Grid 2. It is decently balanced and offers a lot of content for the price. Easily one of the best games on the Quest in this genre!,"Awesome graphics, movement, game play, story line, everything. One BIG problem, I desperately need more levels please!!!!","They definitely did their diligence with making this. Graphics look great, the gameplay feels good, story line is pretty fun, & the research tree feels balanced. I’m only on level 28 at writing this, and am excited to finish the game soon and try the endless levels. Follow up, love that ending by the way ;) The endless mode was a fun way to add to the levels but I’m not crazy about taking the same enemies, and pretty much doubling their health on each additional wave, creating immortal enemies after a couple waves. Instead, I’d like to see later game enemies added into the mix on early levels, before adding HP to the enemies."
