Arcaxer,"Arcaxer is a turn based VR RPG with first person action oriented combat, and a 3rd person god-view overworld set in a sci-fi simulation filled with colorful AI characters. In the overworld you will explore procedural dungeons to find equips and new abilities for your character. You can access the hub world to interact with NPC's and buy new items with the credits that you earn in the dungeon. Even though combat is turn based you must dodge enemy attacks with your body, and aim and time your own attacks with gestures. Can you make it to the top of ""The Stack""? Player Classes Choose fighter, thief, or mage to drastically change which abilities you learn as you level up your character. Fighter: A class with a focus on physical attacks Mage: A class with a focus on Hax, the game's special abilities. Thief: A class with wildcard abilities that can change the tide of battle.",12+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, RPG (Role Playing Games)","English, Chinese (China), Japanese","1.43.49

Worth every penny and I Think one of the best VR games out there ( and I own plenty) just go ahead and buy it ðŸ˜‚.. Really great job to devs for this great game!!","I love the battle mechanics, dodging attacks and throwing hax (spells). The enemies are varied as well. It's one of the longer games on the Quest and it feels like a full game and not just a tech demo. There was a glitch with the treadmill that I mentioned in my previous iteration of this review, but the devs seem to have fixed it in the latest update. It's awesome to see that they're still maintaining a game that was released a few years ago. Bravo, and I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel!!","One more game that has good ideas, but lack a good implementation. I bought the game for the fights which looked interesting. Truth is, the dodge part is not polished enough, which makes the end result unpleasant to play with. And the attack system is super simple and boring. So, it makes the whole game uninteresting unfortunately.",By far one of the best vr games i have played in a while and the the game is kinda buggy in a fun way that I love also I don't know why but the tread mill when I use it after like gaining like 30 health I get kicked out of the game so I have no way of going health other than leveling up can you pls fix?,"The first person battles are absolutely amazing, casting all kinds of spells then physically dodging enemy attacks is very addictive!! I highly recommend this game! However, I own a Quest 1 and during long boss battles the game often crashes... (Patiently waiting for a Quest 3 lol)"
