New Species Found,Dive! Your mission is to investigate reports of unclassified sea life in an underwater biome. Get ready to explore the mysteries of the ocean as you take the control of the OE-Mk IV submarine. You have arrived at your oceanic laboratory which is your homebase for species classification and refueling. The Mk IV submarine has limited fuel and oxygen. Fuel and oxygen consumption is increased by high speeds and excessive spotlight and instrument use. You will need to collect information about sea life and return to the laboratory before exhausting your resources to complete a successful mission. If you run out of fuel or oxygen before returning to your homebase your research will be lost at sea. New Species Found! Combines action and adventure while exploring and learning about the undersea world and the amazing animals that live there.,3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Educational, Exploration",English,1,Immersive 3D,Immersive 3D,https://www.immersive-3d.com/,"Oct 8, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3502030493241976/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3502030493241976&r=1, https://www.immersive-3d.com/PrivacyPolicy",Terms of Service,445.2 MB,"Updated: Great once you get the hang of the steering. I was trying rotate the steering wheel like a real one, but it doesnâ€™t work like that. You have tilt the controllers side to side, feels awkward but ok with a bit of practice."
