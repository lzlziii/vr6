Energysaber Masta VR,"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away... Just kidding But imagine yourself standing in magnet boots on top of the spaceship, overlooking a galaxy, equipped with 2 energysabers with built-in rail-guns, hearing this alien synth sound alarming you about the drones coming up in different shapes and styles. Be the masta of your sabers and your people. Protect yourself and protect them. Physical and mind activities: - 360 arm swings - 180 body rotation - Squats - Dodging lasers - Precision training - Attention exercising - Spaceship walking if you have enough room It's a VR deep-space experience. It's a survival game. Good luck!

Except for the light sabers the similarity ends there. There is much more complexity to the game, you will aim and shoot as much as swing and even block incoming enemy fire. Set your expectation for a cool Star Wars themed arcade game and you will not be disappointed! I am sure a lot more refinement is still in the works, but Energysaber Masta is already a fun experience, well worth the position in the Occulus Store.",I havenâ€™t played it yet but it looks mad fun.
