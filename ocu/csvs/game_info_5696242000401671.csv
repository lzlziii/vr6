For this game I set up the stationary circle boundary which pretty much matched up with the platform you are on although you can probably use either guardian as you don't move just really turn around in all directions shooting toward ceiling, floor and all around. I found this very comfortable the way they have the platform shouldn't make people sick. You earn different guns by beating levels. I thought this was beautiful environment, well polished game lots of fun and family friendly.","Astroroxx feels like the classic game, Asteroid in VR, FPS style. It‚Äôs a casual experience with easy pick up and play controls. Great for parties and persons new to VR. It can be addictive fun, but also, with its limited gameplay offerings and repetition, I believe it can only be enjoyed by most in short bursts, as should be expected from casual wave shooters. Here‚Äôs the video review https://youtu.be/-5QVg4XhtY8","Overall not very exciting. You are given a platform to stand on surrounded by a low quality skybox. Basic plasma guns to shoot the slow moving asteroids and random ""UFOs"". This would be way better if it was an actually VR version of Asteroids however it is not. There's a leaderboard but doesn't really apply much incentive to grind up the boards. Replayability is low. I would not spend $9.99 on it.",A great shooting game. I've unlocked fearless mode.,"Yeah, old school - I really like it! It‚Äòs real fun for the whole family üëç Can be pretty addictive"
