Shadow Point,"Built for VR, Shadow Point is a story-driven puzzle game set between a mountaintop observatory and an ever-changing fantasy world. Explore a vibrant kingdom, cast shadows and solve mind-bending puzzles as you uncover the mystery of missing schoolgirl, Lorna McCabe who vanished from Shadow Point Observatory twelve years ago. You are Alex Burkett. Guided by the journal of Edgar Mansfield – narrated by Sir Patrick Stewart – you will ascend via cable car to the abandoned summit and discover a portal to another realm. As your adventure unfolds, you will manipulate gravity, play with your own reflection, walk on walls, peer through a magical lens to reveal an alternate reality and much more.

The puzzles start simple but get quite challenging (in a good way) as you progress. The story is nicely done and gives you goosebumps. The gameplay lasts hours and hours, giving you great value for the money :)","This game provides lots of gameplay, with puzzles that are unique, interesting, challenging, and fun. (There were a few I couldn't figure out, but the developers provide full walkthroughs on their YouTube channel.) The story is mysterious, gentle, sad, and sweet. The visuals and audio are simple but pretty. Being in this world feels peaceful and almost meditative. A lovely experience.","Visually compelling, wonderful game play and a poignant storyline! I was becoming despondent as I approached the final segment only to discover there were more puzzles to solve than I had anticipated! And when I completed those and returned to the “dashboard”, I realised there were some segments I hadn’t completed - so I returned to their universes and won my missing moons (this will make sense if you play the game). Then I returned to the dashboard and wondered what happened if I flipped the switches now I had completed every task - and there was even MORE (the “workroom”) to discover and solve! I can’t wait to see what else the talented crew behind this game will create for VR!","Absolutely amazing game. Just first level is not so overwhelming, so don't give up and keep going. The story is poignant, puzzles are great. Textures could have better quality, but the most important is gameplay and it delivers.",I am glad they fixed this game I totally enjoy it I hope there are more to come I like these puzzle games
