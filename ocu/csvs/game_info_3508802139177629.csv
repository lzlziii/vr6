I don’t want it to end. Guns in chapter 3 are not great for long shots so having hard time, but I’m just gonna have to use stealth and get closer. You have to keep in mind it’s Twilight Zone. Cannot stress this enough. This game is fantastic. Don’t hesitate…buy it!","I’m a fan of the show and I’m open minded to many games. I can’t recommend this one as it seemed like they came up with some good stories for the chapters, but didn’t know how to execute those into fun gameplay. The monsters in chapter 2 seem like someone just learned how to make enemies in a game. Granted the big ones that appear out of the ground can give a jumpscare. Chapter 3 had a cool premise, but it was really short. The house part was kind of cool. This game made me have motion sickness which does not happen often to me in VR. I changed all of the options to adjust the comfort level, but still didn’t find a way to fix it. I did beat the game just to get it over with and tried to get some enjoyment out of it. Good luck with future games that you make as I’m sure you will improve.","It’s not often I buy a game that I can’t find at least some entertainment value but I finally reached that pinnacle when I bought The Twilight Zone. Being old enough to remember the TV show , I was expecting something that resembled it. I was wrong. After about 4 tries to understand what I was supposed to do in the game, I started to progress, but not very far. Out of frustration, I deleted the game.","Update: After my initial review below, I'm lowering my score to a mere two stars. The first episode was so-so. The second one was a chore. Remember Ground Hog Day? Bill Murray's weatherman re-living each day hundreds -- maybe thousands -- of times with slight variations? You'll get a sense of what he went through when you play this game... and it's not fun at all. Scenes play the same way over and over until you find the right combination of button mashing and moves to advance the story forward. There are glitches... in the second ep one scene kept repeating the same few seconds over and over and nothing I did would kill the creatures, nor advance the scene. In another glitch the phantom girl I was chasing was frozen at the top of a ladder. The 'twist' ending was underwhelming. The graphics are sometimes okay, but mostly well below standard for an 'escape room' type game. I've started the third story just to get my money's worth, but it seems as repetitive as the first two. The least interesting game I've played on my Quest. My initial impressions... Good intro which calls back to the original series. Lots of murky visuals meant to enhance the atmosphere, but also serve to somewhat disguise the cartoon-y visuals. The control system is the biggest frustration. It's simple enough to learn, but it stops working randomly. While the creature is elsewhere, I'll stand and sprint using the joystick as directed. It works... until it doesn't. I'll suddenly stop running and be pinned in place, unable to do anything til the creature sees me and gets me. Is the game glitchy? Wating for graphics to load? Does the game deliberately slow the gameplay down to artificially extend overall gameplay? Who knows?","It's enjoyable for what it is, and it's a good entry-level game for VR horror."
