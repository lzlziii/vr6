The screen tends to get very crowded when the enemies come flying in fast beats on harder difficulties and it could get very hard to see when they were approaching and in what order. That has been totally fixed in this version, and you can even look below them to see a series of lines denoting the exact location and count on each wave. The game is still fairly fresh on the VR scene tho, being only a few months old at this point and I think any small problems that I am about to list will be fixed in time. I want to just say that I definitely enjoy this game and will be playing it a lot more. So, let's talk about the parts that could use some small changes that would bump this up to a 5. 1. We need a restart button on the results screen. You can restart from the pause menu but not after you beat the song, making it a tiny bit frustrating to restart after completing a song. Plus the menu.... 2. Speaking of the pause screen, I only found one way to activate it and that was the oculus button which also brings up the oculus menu. Not the biggest deal once again. 3. I think some form of offset would be nice. I have a habit of hitting notes a tiny bit early or late in most games so I like to adjust to accommodate this. I found myself needing to shoot a split second before my brain wanted to by listening to the beat. I think this could just be something I could get used to but an offset would be cool. Even if it was only able to offset a bit in either direction. This would also help for using Bluetooth headphones. 4. I would really like to see varying difficulties for each song. Right now each song only has one difficulty. On that same note, I think a way for the community to make charts is always a way to bring people in and expand your reach. I know that games like Boom Box has a list of DMCA free songs that you can chart to so they are able to host the music file and chart. Then you can host the charts from within the game. In all, I love it. There are only a few things that could be fixed and those are small. Otherwise the game is amazing. I can truly recommend it to anyone who is into rhythm games or shooters. The price is incredibly fair for what is here. You can definitely get your money's worth. Of course there are leaderboards as well, but I was able to climb it pretty easily due to there not being many higher level players. I did see a couple of other youtubers on the leaderboard which was neat. I give this a 4 out of 5 stars with it easily being able to grab that extra star with a couple of updates! Even without custom song support.","Rhythm based space shooter is easy to pick up but hard to master. With songs at different difficulties has something for everyone. Can be repetitive over time so needs some different enemies to shoot, guns and that. Fun time with whats there hope they add more songs to it soon. Video gameplay: New Beat Saber Style Space Shooter Galactigun https://youtu.be/W7IlPVdkIww",Video Review - https://youtu.be/5NOLdCeyls0 GalacticgunVR is a great new rhythm game for the Quest that does a great job making shooting robots to music fun. Lots of genres and a few special gimmicks to keep it unique the game has you fighting off against DJ Kranius the guy who sends the robots your way. You really just gotta see 10 seconds of gameplay to get the idea but if you are into this style of game this one has a lot of polish and excellent music selection. Check out my full video review to get the complete rundown but to summerarize I think this one is well worth playing.
