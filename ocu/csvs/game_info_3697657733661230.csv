Captain ToonHead vs The Punks from Outer Space,"""‘Captain Toonhead Might Be The Most Over-The-Top VR Game Ever"" - VRScout ""One of the best tower defense games I have played in VR."" - VRGameFaqs *An ACTION TOWER DEFENSE* You'll move all over the map, hammering away to upgrade towers, throwing over-powered chanclas recklessly and taking control of your towers to unleash streams of heavy-metal powered hot sauce and shoot electric beams from weaponized pizza at your enemies. *The hero we got stuck with* After the squad sent by the World Treaty for Freedom (WTF) got fried in the ""burrito incident"", it falls to Elliott Salazar, the cartoon-obsessed space janitor and only survivor, to save Earth. There’s a new captain onboard: Captain ToonHead! *Balance action and strategy* Shooting alone will not defeat the waves of Cyber-C.H.I.C.K.E.N.s and Terra-S.H.A.R.K.s. Combine those PIGñata tower bombs with your chancla throws in a very strategic way if you want to save the EnerCubes and defeat Nicholas Voorhees' P.U.N.K. army!",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Shooting",English,1.6.18,Teravision_Games,Teravision Games,http://captaintoonhead.co/,"Nov 11, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3697657733661230/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3697657733661230&r=1, https://teravisiongames.com/site/privacy-policy/",2.56 GB,"This is a great game! I love tower defence games, and I wish there were more. If this company makes any more oculus games, I’ll buy them in a second. I’d also be fine paying for new levels for THIS game too. Or a sequel… I really like the new “endless” mode, but I wish you could save your progress. I can last a long time in endless mode, but I run out of time to play, and can’t save it.","People on here write template reviews and they are terrible. Or they just say 5 stars good game! Or trash a game for small reasons. Captain Toonhead is an amazingly intricate and well-crafted game. It oozes style with graphics that have a super art style. The particle effects shine and the cartoony graphics do it justice. You run into anthropomorphic burrito in one of the first scenes and the humor doesn't let up. The controls are remarkably well thought out and you'll be effortlessly placing turrets around the battlefield, whipping yourself around to control them and shoot the hordes. I'm a fan and I hope they continue to improve it with new maps and perhaps a deeper meta. As it is, it's worth the buy and you'll enjoy what the developer has created here if you're a fan of tower defense FPSs. I applaud the devs as this is what I'm looking for on Quest 2. Completely new experiences where you feel nostalgic and transported into another world.","I love this game. I actually completed it and highly recommend new comers to purchase. However, the VR Simulation game keeps crashing in the middle of game play. And I don't understand how to fit it. The game is updated to its latest, so I'm not understanding the problem on why it keeps crashing, or is there a bug in the game far as playing the VR butt kicking simulation. Please fix","Fun and crazy. An interesting twist on Tower games. It takes a bit to get the hang of it but once you do, it is NORMAL difficulty even to get ALL the cubes. Love the voice acting of the Captain Toon head. Janin-9 was also very good.","What a blast to play. Chickens with bombs !!! Flying coyotes !!!! T Rex Land shark!!!! Bad jokes !!! This one has it all. Best of all you are right in the action flinging your flip flops or blasting the punks with trusty blaster. Devs please add more levels. Great game don't wait buy it now!!!!! Still love this master piece, more levels please."
