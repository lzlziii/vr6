Koord Coach,"Train your reflexes, cardio and coordination the fun way with three different game modes, each of which has two or more sub-game modes. All events in the game happen randomly, ensuring that no two play sessions are the same, to make sure you stay on your toes. Various difficulties and game duration settings allow you to tailor the play sessions to your preferences. The game modes are: 1. cube activation - touch game objects when they become active 2. block incoming objects - block or dodge objects trying to hit you 3. endurance - touch objects appearing around you before they disappear",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Casual, Sports",English,1.4,Koord Coach Studios,Koord Coach Studios,https://koordcoach.com/,"Apr 27, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5097554840287261/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5097554840287261&r=1, https://koordcoach.com/privacyPolicy",344.7 MB,"This is an interesting workout game. The best setup, by far, is Normal Endurance with squatting and max distance. Everything else goes just too fast for me. I wish there was an Endurance mode that doesn't time out the orbs and instead waits for you to touch all the valid ones (and then runs a brief timer for the black ones to expire), and keeps adding another orb every 10 cycles. That way, the 10+ minute sessions don't get too boring. Actually, it'd be awesome if the player could be optionally armed with sticks to hit orbs (which should then be larger), instead of just touching them; that'd make for far more of a workout! It'd be great if the game built virtual walls based on your real Guardian space, so you don't accidentally wander out of the Guardian because of how much space the arena deceptively presents.",This game is fun dodging and blocking but the health bar buds are too off screen for me to see and I don't think this game is for me. If you wanna work on your reflexes and get a workout this is for you.,"I'm a 3rd degree Black Belt karate instructor with kickboxing experience, and a majoe VR fitness enthusiast. I even did a podcast episode with MetaFitness in May of 2022. I have a YouTube channel dedicated to the 9 Fitness apps I play with numerous subscribers. I recently tried and now play Koord Coach after the developer contacted me and I must say this is a fascinating, well developed, fun, and effective app. Fun for adults and kids alike. It's amazing that it's free as well. We'll worth trying and sharing with others. Looking forward to making more videos on it like the other ones on my yourube channel.","This game has huge potential. It's not yet polished but already very fun. Usually workout and music games work this way that there are things coming on you and you are just moving left and right, here you can move in all directions because objects are slowly flying around. Great work!","Have played many Vr Fitness/ Rytm games and each game has its charms. I tried Koord Coach and I must say I liked it. I like to challenge myself. Physically and mentally. This game has both. Although the basics are already there, I have faith that things can only get better. I would recommend people to give it a try. Kind regards from the Netherlands"
