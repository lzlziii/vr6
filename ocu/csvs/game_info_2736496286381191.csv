My younger brother who's 54, has been a Wipeout fan from its original version on the Sony Ps1 days. He never like any of the clones of it. So I let him have my Quest over the weekend, while I'm working. Got my Quest back and now he agrees with me that this game is better than Wipeout.","Its just a really bad game, never buy","I was raised here in Orlando and one of my favorite rides as a child was ""space mountain"" it was a roller coaster in the dark with flashing multicolored lights and many twists, turns and dips. This is very similar, only u can control the pod and every now and then u leave the track! The music sounds like nine inch nails. Very fun.",I love this game i came from the ps1 generation i loved wipeout and always dreamed of actually flying something this futuristic and vr fabulous üë©‚ÄçüöÄ,Difficulty is beyond frustration. No real feel for speed. Absolutly mediocre gameplay. Buy it when its for sale like a 5er. Not worth your money and time.
