NervBox,"Enter The Simulation. NervBox is a VR, physics-based, sandbox designed to let players push the limits of interactivity. PHYSICS. VR. MULTIPLAYER. In a first for VR, players are no longer ghostly beings that can phase through each other. In NervBox, not only is your physical body simulated in-game but so are other players. Push each other around, work together, or fight to the death, there are no limits. Immersive Interactions NervBox features an accurate interaction system and various mechanics to make combat feel good. Rack a shotgun with one hand, toss a knife in the air, force-grab it back, climb over a friend or give a crisp high five. Active Ragdolls Your friends aren't the only living entities in-game. NervBox features fully physics-driven NPCs that will attack you and your friends. Use guns, swords, or just your fists and fight back. Multiple Gamemodes Fight and defend your base from NPCs, sharpen your combat skills in the close quarters “Kill House”, or let your imagination run wild in the sandbox mode; NervBox contains various levels designed to let you and your friends experience something new every time you play. Next Level Audio NervBox features fully spatialized audio for everything, so you will be entirely immersed not just visually or physically. Big empty rooms will have reverb, large structures will block sounds entirely, and even voice comms are spatialized.",12+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Simulation, Social",English,0.2.1493,Quantum Lion Labs,Quantum Lion Labs,https://nervbox.com/,"Apr 27, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/8266142733428062/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=8266142733428062&r=1, https://nervbox.com/privacy/",1.41 GB,I love this game its a really good but you need friends to play or it gets boring luckly i have them so its really fun and even if you have no one you can play the servers but i prefere the private lobbys with my friend this game is worth it if you want a bonelabs type multiplayer game this is for u its cheap and fun,"Graphics are decent, Multiplayer is great, but I definitely don’t think it’s worth $14.99 due to all the bugs and crashes it has. It should at least be $4.99 for the early stages the game is in. IT CRASHES WHEN I GRAB THE FLOOR.",For some reason I can only spawn 2 npcs and after that I cant spawn anymore. i cant spawn more than 2 of anything. Its not like there is a delete gun so i can just remove the npcs already there. its just annoying And why do the npcd have so much health m? They take like 3 whole pistol mags,"-Graphics □ You forget what reality is □ Beautiful ☑ Good □ Bad □ Don't look too long at it □ MS-DOS -{ Gameplay)--- □ Very good ☑ Good □ It's just gameplay □ Mehh □ Watch paint dry instead -{ Audio )- □ Eargasm □ Very good □ Good ☑ Not too bad □ Bad □ I'm now deaf -Audience □ Kids ☑ Teens ☑ Adults □ Grandma -Difficulty □ Just press 'W' □ Easy ☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master □ Significant brain usage □ Difficult □ Dark Souls -Grind ☑ Nothing to grind □ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks □ Isn't necessary to progress Average grind level □ Too much grind □ You'll need a second life for grinding -Game Time (Story) □ Long enough for a cup of coffee □ Short Average □ Long □ To infinity and beyond ☑ No story -Game Time (Sandbox/ Other Activities) □ Long enough for a cup of coffee □ Short □ Average □ Long ☑ To infinity and beyond -Price □ It's free! □ Worth the price ☑ If it's on sale □ If u have some spare money left -Bugs □ Never heard of □ Minor bugs □ Can get annoying ☑ARK: Survival Evolved □ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs - ?/10 □ 1 □ 2 □ 3 □ 4 □ 5 □ 6 □ 7 ☑ 8 □ 9 □ 10 Edit: Nervbox is a pretty simple game, combining GMOD and BONELAB (sound effects and multiplayer from gmod, vr, physics and controls from bonelab). With the number of bugs, I sadly cannot recommend to buy this for 15$ right now. However, this is an early access game, and it's understandable to have these bugs (and lack of maps) in a beta game. It is however still a fun game, but the main problem is the low amount of active players. Buying it now is still a great fun when players are around.","Good game, hilarious Please add private codes, fix grip, fix game crashing Usually crashing is annoying but in this game all you can do is laugh it off Please add character customization but mainly add the npc as a outfit"
