I’m now looking forward to the full game. Keep up the good work!,I gave this three stars for one reason and one reason only because the game is fun and amazing but it's not the full game I can only play like three boards and that sucks so it’s only a Demo and I can’t wait to purchase the full game!!! I just hate when they do that it’s like a tease like I want the full game￼,I cannot join a multiplayer server but I have Wi-Fi￼. Also I’m nine years old so I cannot use discord I’m sorry your games good 10 out of 10
