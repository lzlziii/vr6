Having to mute every user individually is awful. I’d be happy to update my review once this is fixed. It’s a fun game but this is a deal breaker. Reviewer Reply: You can see that this is an issue by looking at the other low review scores, especially from those with young children. My advice, spend less time responding to reviews and more time adding mute functionality. Yes. An option to completely turn off voice chat. No rx, no tx, like most console and pc games. It’s possible to mute the mic systemwide, but not incoming voice. I’ll change my review to 5 stars as soon as this happens."
