I would gladly give this game a five star rating of the bugs even is minors they are would be fixed. 1â€¦ No game audio on lunchï¿¼ bug. sometimes you boot the game up the audio wonâ€™t work.(work around = you have to tap the power button on and off to get the audio for the game to work ) 2â€¦ Free slot machine spins bug. Often you get three free spins but you have to quit out of the game reload it to be able to Have your three free spins show up and usable. 3â€¦ Single use controller bug when I play with only one controller the other controller goes to sleep but then a huge laser beam Ends up shooting across the screen blocking the view of the game unless you move the controllerï¿¼.,For a solitaire lover like me this game provides all that I need for a relaxing getaway from the stress after a big day. Definitely recommend!,I haven't seen such a game for Oculus 2,Good game well done dev !
