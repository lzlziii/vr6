I was stunned by the atmosphere, it was a bit like being in Miyazaki's world! The graphics are stunning on Quest 2. For the price, I think it's worth it to dive into this world. The puzzles are fun, but also quite easy. The spells that change the environment are brilliant! Sometimes I would giggle when I messed up the spells, because something always happened :) The new teleportation was fun. I want to try the coop mode as soon as I can, because I saw in the menu that there is an option for that, but only through wifi. What I miss is that I'd love to cast spells on creatures, but I read on the developers site that this game is still in development and they are working on some combat modes. I do miss the hand interaction, but the magic pointer is a neat idea, it makes life easier for the seated players, including mine. Pro - Atmosphere (graphics, music) - Effect of magic on the environment - Fun effects on our Avatar - Fun ending of puzzles - In-game menu - Optional Avatars - I didn't run into any major bugs - Cheap Con (knowing that it's still in development) - Few maps - Lack of hand interaction - No online mode only wifi - Lack of story in the game, but I think this can be addressed in the future (I hope) I'm curious to see where it will evolve and look forward to seeing the game expanded as soon as possible! Good luck for the developers!","Zephyrus is a fun adventure puzzle game that uses the powers of the elements to fight, solve puzzles and unlock new areas of the map.
