Updates have been coming regularly and devs have been responsive to feedback. Clearly a labor of love! b i t , l y / V R b o x i n g",Game works well when in comparison to real boxing exercises. The bags like the speed bag and double end bag work just like the real thing with speed and timing. Doing the VR fights works great as a conditioning tool. Overall a great VR game and can’t wait to see what other improvements will be made in the future!,"Punch mechanics.,. I can't stress this enough. The game play is fair . far from perfect. I've been playing this game for approximately 8 months the updates are far and few between the Developers saying that they're working on the game but it doesn't seem that way. Seriously guys., punch mechanics are very important Early Access or not. after 8 months the punch mechanics should have been improved already that's the most important part of any boxing game. Thrill of the fight.,. Got it right don't get me wrong it's not a bad game but how long does it take to fix punch mechanics. Another issue is Health recovery you don't recover almost like an arcade game very unrealistic. For Early Access it's not bad, but definitely not worth four or five stars in the states that it is now take it from me I've been playing a lot. I've been ranked number two in monthly damage. So I know what I'm talking about. Overall I still love playing this game I got so much hope for it. We need something other than thrill of the fight. And Creed. Analog movement is also a plus great job. Even though Creed has added it to its game as well. Wondering did they get the idea from you guys. I know it's an early access,, but in 4 months this game would have been out a whole year. Games that already have been released have had more updates then you guys. I know y'all are busy competing in the Golden Gloves tournament but don't forget about us we want to fight too.","I really enjoyed how realistic the double end bags and speed bags were, and how easy it was to navigate around. Great game!","As an avid Thrill of the Fight player doing 12 rounds of outclassed I did not expect too much from this game going into it. To my surprise it was actually a great new experience within the boxing genre, a breath of fresh air from replaying Creed and TOTF. It has its own unique style of fighting which can certainly work up a sweat. I really love that liver/body shots have an impact and cause reaction from the AI. Like others have mentioned, there is still some work required on the AI but from reading the comments the developers seem to be working actively on this. The only major thing that impacted my game play was trying to control the fight within the Oculus Guardian, the inability to move or push back the AI by walking into them can cause you to be in awkward areas in real life. Not sure if this is just an issue I was having on Quest 2 being unable to move the characters with joysticks when the fight starts."
