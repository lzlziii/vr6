If you would like a boost to start your journey, you can input “Thebookgeek” as the player who referred you for extra rewards upon reaching level 5. Edit: Ignore any reviews claiming that the community is toxic or false bans are a problem. Moderators will only issue out bans on repeat offenses/visual proof of refusing to de-escalate, never a single false report. Also, reputation taverns have replaced the previous age separated taverns, so if you “be on and behave” you will automatically gain reputation and the ability to play with higher-reputation players",Cards and Tankards is the best app lab game and one of the best oculus games it's worth the download especially if you enjoy other card games like magic the gathering and hearthstone but it is the superior card game thank you for making this game I can't wait to see what the future holds.... As they say it is inevitable,"This is a game that reminds me of other card games and it is as in depth as any of them. For another thing, IT’S F***ING FREE do I really need to say more than that. It does have 100+ different cards from 5 different categories, a great community, plus they have moderators and reputation based taverns that keep the taverns people fun. As an added bonus, they don’t try and shove micro transactions down your throat but they do them in a currency format (like in PokerStars if you’ve played it). As for whether it’s worth it’s price, I’d have said yes if it was worth $10 or $15 but instead it’s free and the devs have done a great job on it and are still working on making it better. I don’t really know why you are reading this seeing as all you have to see is the $0 price tag and like the concept and it will be worth the price but I will still write this regardless.","I play a lot of card games, both IRL and online, but I find this one to be so much more fun than the others because it doubles as a chat room AND is balanced. As for the community, it has to be the most welcoming one in existence, no one is particularly unkind, (except of course the children too young for VR) and it has better moderation than any other game EVER period. (you can report someone, and a moderator will walk in within 5 minutes to discuss it with you) As for the gameplay, it’s a kind of like a mix of Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering, and it just… works better than the two separately (in my opinion, at least) it’s not too hard to obtain new cards, nor is it to find an opponent. The game is still growing to this day, so it’s only going to get better as time goes on!","I started playing CAT in the beginning of June, it took me a while to pick up the game play but once I did I’ve been hooked ever since! I’ve met a great group of people through the public taverns and often host tournaments myself. Super excited for this next update they have coming out - can’t wait to see what they have in store for all of us."
