So good in fact that it almost got me to quit drugs...almost. Now here's a nice recipe for Quiche! Mmmhmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmm... weird name. 1 refrigerated pie crust ‚ñ¢6 large eggs ‚ñ¢¬æ cup milk or cream ‚ñ¢¬æ teaspoon salt ‚ñ¢¬º teaspoon black pepper ‚ñ¢1 cup cooked ham chopped ‚ñ¢1 ¬Ω cups shredded cheese divided ‚ñ¢3 tablespoons green onions Preheat oven to 375¬∞F. Unroll pie crust and press into a 9"" pie plate, crimping the top edges if desired. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, salt and pepper. Sprinkle ham, 1 cup of cheese, and green onions into the pie crust and pour the egg mixture over top. Sprinkle remaining ¬Ω cup cheese on top of egg mixture. Bake for 35-40 minutes until the center is completely set. Let cool for 10-15 minutes. And if you love gluten free like I don't, it's called an omelette...Snoogans.","I Love this game!!! I was lucky enough to play test this game and fell in Love! Roguelikes are my favorite genre, and this is a gem! Short sweet burst, I found are the best way to consume roguelikes. Reminds me of doom in some ways, but different. I'm Hooked for sure!! Great job JoyWay üòäüëç","I want to start with the elephant in the room. This is at its core another Until you fall style roguelite game. The same kind of procedural ""Die, start over to progress"" game that I'm sure many VR gamers are getting sick to death of by now. Myself included. While they do tout ""Story Elements"" it's just narration as you progress. Essentially you progress through Rooms of Enemies. At the end of each room, you get a reward (or punishment) then you have a choice of 2 rooms you want to progress through with different themes and modifiers. They do have an Ingame crafting system for Perks but it's essentially a minigame for what every other game would just have you click a button to upgrade. But nonetheless interesting. While I do want to utterly despise this game for being ""Yet another VR Roguelite"" Sigh...... What they have done with the game is incredibly good. The interactions for the most part are very polished. The only gripe I have is you may have a little difficulty getting the game to Change weapons you have equipt for new ones you obtain. But the climbing, Arm swinging Running & grappling work flawlessly. Something other games seem to struggle with. The reloading mechanics are innovative and interesting for Duelweilding and surprisingly natural to do as you are swinging from the ceiling lol. The enemies are varied in style and attacks. It's overall a really polished experience sliding towards the AAA end of the spectrum in quality UI and gameplay. It would have been nice to see more (Hell any) variations on the grapple kills and seems like a missed opportunity if I was to compare them to the Doom Special kills (Which is essentially what it is) Overall I don't think you would be sad or disappointed with your purchase in the slightest. It's very fun to play and definitely a high-quality VR game. In my personal opinion though I would have loved to have seen a properly crafted campaign with the Rougelite tacked on as an extra mode.","üìåDead Hook - 25üìå üëâ gigonvr,pl/s/DH25 (replace the comma with a dot) I played the game in the PRESS version and I haven't had so much fun in a long time. ‚úÖ Impressive graphics ‚úÖ Lots of weapons ‚úÖ Satisfying finishers on demons ‚úÖ Satisfying movement ü§ú I RECOMMEND WITH ALL MY HEART. The game gave me and still gives me a lot of fun","When it‚Äôs running on all gears, Dead Hook is a glorious fluid flow of graceful demonic chain-murder. The grapple hook swinging mechanics are fantastic, the weapons are cool, and when you get good at the game, you‚Äôll find yourself striking wonderful chains of shoot, grapple, dismember, shoot, grapple dismember, leaving a parade of demonic corpses in your wake. It really does feel like the swinging action of Swarm mixed with the pulse-pounding non-stop killing sprees of Doom, put into a roguelike blender and served in VR. The graphics are good, well suited for Quest, but stylized enough to keep things running at a breakneck pace, and the audio is great at driving the action and keeping you swinging, dashing, and killing. Dead Hook‚Äôs only real weakness is that the bosses aren‚Äôt at all inspired, but hey, the rest of the action more than makes up for it, especially at this price. Easy to recommend for anybody with strong enough VR legs to handle it, and a propensity for action. For our full review, search YouTube for Dead Hook 6DOF Reviews :)"
