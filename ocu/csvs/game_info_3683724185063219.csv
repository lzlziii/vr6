The largest of all, TƒÅne Mahuta, is about 2,000 years old and hosts an entire ecosystem of more than 100 species in his canopy. However, the kauri are currently threatened by a tiny microbe causing kauri dieback disease. This VR experience teaches you about the kauri tree and its connectedness with the surrounding forest. It also introduces the microbe causing kauri dieback disease, and what you can do to help keep the forest healthy.
