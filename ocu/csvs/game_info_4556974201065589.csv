If you want roam a large surreal city with flying cars and random animals on every street corner, this is your app. You can grab a rocket and fly. You can use web-slingers to bound through the city like Spider-Man. You can land on rooftops or climb walls of buildings. Dinosaurs and sea creatures also appear at random. The controls can be awkward. If release the trigger, you will drop whatever your holding and good luck finding it. You will likely have to restart the game to find another rocket or web-slinger. The ‘game’ involves removing as many tagged bad creatures as you can in 2 minutes before you automatically respawn. I prefer free mode in which the game part is removed and you can roam as long as you want without timer. I also opted to turn off the music option, which can be grating after a while. For 99 cents the graphics are fun and there is a lot to explore. Sort of like a VR Toca Boca game with advanced graphics. Fun for a while. A nice escape.",Large amount of content for the price leaves me giving this experience 5 stars overall!,"I have played a few other ZOSU games, and they have been fun ways for a younger audience to try VR. This game is no different, but I actually found myself having a blast as an adult as well! There are a few different methods of locomotive (walking, flying, grapple webs) and they are all a ton of fun. Navigate the city however you want, save the animals, fight the baddies. It's a simple concept, but we'll executed! Menus could use some polish, but you'll forget after the gameplay.","The game has some interesting ideas but needs a lot of fleshing out. I liked the animals. I received it for free, I don't think it's at a point where it makes sense to charge money yet.","The dev's newer game, based in a weird ocean environment, is a better iteration on this idea, which is a sort of superhero-in-a-dreamscape concept with dodgy graphics but a compelling sense of wonder and reward for simply being in the space. Giant and often freaky creatures roam and for some reason you touch them and they disappear. Oddly bad but brilliant too. Worth the money? Definitely."
