I feel like some sort of congratulations are in order here. The game itself looks nice enough for App Lab and I'm sure the finished product's going to look even nicer... but that's a completely moot point, because the controls are completely horrible. It's a shame, really. Could have been a nice little racer with usable controls. And no, I'm not going to spend weeks slowly practicing with the unwieldy controls to ""get the hang of it"". I'm just going to give it one star and not play it any more. I'm sure the control system looked good on paper and the dev can handle it very well himself, since he's coded it. But for a regular user, just forget about it. This does not work in practice.",This is very close to Star Wars podraceing game,"Good graphics, nice playability but the controls require some buzz or vibration to determine edges (its strange some movements like up down, push and pull send you far and others didn't be recognized in every try) I recommend a mix of sound and vibration to determine limits of the ""controllers"" to provide better experience, or maybe light (green= go red= backwards or stop) its complicated drive and turn in general and the heat release its weird (it suppose I must left 1 handler to release heat? both? or never get in to overheat?) but with a few corrections the experience could be more challenging than frustrating. A tutorial race 'll be the best way to ""get right"" the UX to success in general races.","This is the most fantastically triumphant piece of virtual media I have ever experienced, and you, the most dearest reader, NEED to download all 513mg of this so called “Dart Racers” - love, Taco","One of the best VR racing games I've played. Controls felt good, I only crashed because of my lack of skill. The tracks were good, a little basic at first but got more interesting, and the AI racers were challenging but reasonable. When more tracks get added, I'll be sure to try them out! I like having the leaderboards, super fun to go for the fastest time and even better to get it, but I'd also love to have online multi-player. Either way, very good game and for such a reasonable price there's no reason not to try it!"
