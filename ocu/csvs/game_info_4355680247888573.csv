But it's the subtle things. Maybe they need some expert consultant to tell them what they're doing wrong because I don't think it's obvious. But first, the obvious thing: they're flirting with that fine line between accessible & boring. Once you go through the tutorial, the Easy level is so easy it's horribly boring. And you just want to close the demo and not even consider buying the full game. But ok, there's a sale going on and the full game has close to 5 star reviews, so I'll make an effort. I switch to Normal level. Still too frigging easy. What's going on? Boring! Then I switch to Hard level, and now it's impossible. Clearly, they don't understand their demographics. I'm just an average person, not terrible and not expert. I think I represent the mainstream, so the Normal level should be fun and challenging for me, average joe. But there isn't such a level. Ok, on to subtle things. The physics aren't satisfying. The way the blocks move, it's just too mechanical, there needs to be more easing in the speed especially when you hit the blocks and they bounce back. Needs expert tweaking to feel satisfying. When blocks overlap each other, there should be some different kind of block there, maybe some animation, to indicate the overlap not just lazy overlapping of cubes. Might even consider giving the blocks directionality: the ones coming toward you may want to look different from the ones going away from you (or give some some of trailing indicator. These seem like little things but it's the little things that make other VR games satisfying and addictive. I'll give it more time because I can imagine a point at which it's right at the level of difficulty that I need and then it would be fun. Just dont' know how long I have to grind to find that level.","I played the demo and my initial impression was very good - you hit the things flying in different places, looks like good boxing game. However the issue is that you don't really feel you are fighting opponent or that you have a control - you just need to punch the boxes and your only decision is which boxes to punch and which to ignore. I may be wrong (played just demo!). Does the power of punch matter somehow? In games like Thrill of the Fight or Gorn you are fighting opponent and you have strategy how to fight. In games like FitXR or Audio Trip you have flying objects designed to the music so you basically do workout to the music. Here it feels that boxes fly randomly and I don't see mechanism for you or oponent to do something with this randomness. I am interested in this game it may be good workout and good fun but need to learn more (maybe from YouTube?).",just need tweaking and I think you guys will be onto a winner!
