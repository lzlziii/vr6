First Hand,"First Hand is an official Hand Tracking demo built by Meta. Experience the magic of interacting with the virtual world directly with your hands. Use switches, levers, virtual UIs as you solve puzzles to build robotic gloves, and then experience their superpowers. We built First Hand to demonstrate the capabilities and the variety of interaction models possible with Hands. This demo is built using the Presence Platform’s Interaction SDK, a library of interaction components, gestures and tools to build magical hand and controller interactions. This demo is also available as an open source project for developers who would like to easily replicate similar interactions. We drew inspiration in this demo from First Contact, the original Meta experience showcasing controller interactions.",3+,Single User,Hand Tracking,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Casual,English,1.3.0,Oculus Samples,Oculus,https://developer.oculus.com/,"Aug 2, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5030224183773255/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5030224183773255&r=1, https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/?utm_source=www.oculus.com&utm_medium=oculusredirect",Terms of Service,434.4 MB,"Hey Meta! We really need this for Unreal Engine asap, today the standard set by Apple is no controllers, and I'm pretty sure that you are aware of that, so as a developer for the Oculus I'm asking for some help here. The SDK for unity isn't compatible with our game, we work in UE5. Thank you!","A sequel to First Contact, and an improvement in most areas, especially the graphics, taking full advantage of the Quest2’s power! This is a perfect hand tracking GEM. Absolutely beautiful to immerse yourself in, if only for around 20 minutes. The second chapter, now added is another success, PLEASE let this be something they continue to work on. Building on this world, if only step by step, would be amazing! Please Meta, this here is GOLD!","Not played this through yet, but let my frustration be your guide. Before launching this, turn on the hand tracking in the main menu. This does not work with the controllers, it is not designed to. Developers, can you please add a nice big un-missable sign to let idiots like myself know to swap to hand tracking.","because as with most great VR games, pictures dont do it justice. Fantastically immersive game that shows off the Quest 2's hand gesture capabilities.",This is the best game I’ve played with hand tracking so far please add more to it
