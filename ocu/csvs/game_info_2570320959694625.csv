It ended really fast and the only fun we had was throwing stuff at each other. You get free coins at first to buy 1 use items, but then you have to pay money. The whole game is just so underwhelming and isnâ€™t worth downloading",I thought never board would be fun BUT NO never board only has one free game which is a ripoff of uno and all of the other games cost money. I installed this game because I thought I'd have fun but I was wrong. This deserves to get deleted,"I join in a seat and Iâ€™m frozen, unable to select anything. Apparently u need to have friends that also have the game to actually play.",I wish you add online becuss i have no friends who have this pls add online and this game is trash,This was dirt ðŸ˜’
