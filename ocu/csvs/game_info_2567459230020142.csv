I like games like Dead Cells and Hades. The gameplay is very good and the progression system is fantastic. When I play this game, I loose track of time. It is so challenging and addictive. You can upgrade your gear and get stronger with every playthrough. Would recommend this game to anyone who likes Rogue-likes! Leave a 👍🏻, if this was helpful. Thanks and enjoy!","One of the best games. It really works your hand eye coronation and reflexes, also just a really fun game to play it's mechanics work well and it's callanging enough to be possible but hard enough to take more than one try even on easy, I found this on the try app feature and liked it so much I bought it, this should kinda tell devs about how useful the test feature really is.",Amazing gameplay and lots of fun and options of weapons I would suggest this game for everyone 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕 🌖 🌘 🌑 🌒 🌓 🌔 🌕,"I was new to the quest when I got this game so I naturally didn’t know about the repetitive nature of vr experiences but this is not the same as this was super creative and original I’ve never seen anything like it 2.5 years I think, and I still play and enjoy the game the concept of precise slashes needed to be taken after depleting a guard meter or stun bar to land a combo then having to hit critical points like beat saber and lines on your screen from enemy attacks and having to line up one of your weapons with this line before the line fills up to parry or block which also depletes the guard bar and the currency Aether is used to buy new weapons and upgrades for them but you have to progress your level to unlock a few, after beating the campaign you unlock another but different halo sword from, but it’s blue not red and it’s stats are different obviously but there’s dashing and charges low level enemy will become dazed by the dash but higher level opponents counter block it like almost every time there are un parry able attacks this is indicated by an arrow which shows which direction to dodge or move in real life this game is insanely hard until you learn to parry, reaction time and skill is required but I still recommend this game to hard time vr veterans and new vr beginners the only downside I found was my arm couldn’t keep up with how much I wanted to play but that’s only if you are a vr beginner but sometimes my arm still hurts when I try to play and I’m a vr vetaran now!!!!! if you found this helpful leave this a 👍 or a helpful you don’t have to but I just want them idk if you want this game for $18.50 instead of $25 send me a message I’m always happy to help out and always remember it’s never over until you fall. Thank you for reading to the end I appreciate it so mucho, byeeeeeeeee!!!!! :)",Absolutely one of the best games on the VR. It’s calibrated perfectly and the game play is so smooth. I put on my weight vest with my ankle and wrist weights and go in on those demons. I hope they make a sequel or add more game play!!!
