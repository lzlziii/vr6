Nice graphics, a great set of songs, extremely addictive gameplay! And great multiplayer. I have only one problem with the leftmost drum, I canâ€™t manage to set a comfortable height, such that the hammer does not fall in and at the same time it is comfortable to play. But perhaps this is just my subjective feature. The rest of the game is just great! I have tried almost every other popular rhythm game in VR, there are many good ones, but it is Ragnarock that I want to return to. Many thanks to the developers for the game and for regular updates! You are making a great product. I hope you continue to support it for a long time.","Do you enjoy a thrilling adventure through the seas of music? Well this is for you. Captain a Viking warship using war drums & the Who Ra from your men-in-arms. Fast paced exiting high adrenaline game (if you play level 10 like me). These songs that will tire you but make you always come back for more. Definitely recommend if you enjoy other arcade music games like beat saber or pistol whip. Definitely my favorite in this category. This game will definitely make you ambidextrous by building your hand-eye coordination & have fun while doing it. Good endurance workout for arms. Side note: Maybe perhaps my dyslexia makes beat saber more difficult or the intense movement of pistol whip & HoloPoint build more of a sweat but this game takes focus to another level. Hope you enjoy, good luck","this is a wonderful game, I have spent hours playing it cause it is addicting to slam those drums to the beats of some heavy metal tunes. I have run into an issue though, that or I may have misunderstood the assignment, the my precious achievement for getting all gold medals for volume 1 hasn't been acquired despite doing exactly that. I beat every volume 1 song on the hardest possible difficulty with gold on each, shall I have to beat every difficulty on every song with gold to earn the achievement? hopefully you take this info gracefully, the game is wonderful despite the issue, I would just like to see the rewards of my hard effort since this game is still very difficult, best to the devs and to you guy who reads the reviews","The latest Sabaton raid is overpriced. There are only 6 3+ minutes songs of which only two are bangers. With the Gloryhammer dlc there are only six, but at least one is over 10 minutes which adds a fun challenge. And it costs like 3 dollars less. The new ship design is nice, but the new level design is. . . brown. Nothing against the color, just maybe a lackluster choice. Anywho, I'm sure it's worth it if you get it in a bundle.","Being at the drums, on a ship full of vikings is awesome and the song library is really diverse. Drumming to songs about the sea or calls to battle makes you feel like you are truly part of battle hardened warrior party. What doesn't make you feel like one is the fact that the game cannot log in, and when it does after restarting the Wifi connection and the game and clicking the login button several times, in multiplayer the game decides that the connection has timed out and you are kicked out of the song. I didn't notice issues with my internet connection with any other game or application I have, except for this, and pretty much every time I play this game. If the networking would be put in place, I'd give it 5 stars, but right now, I'd say it's a 3.5 - 4."
