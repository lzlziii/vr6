The imagination of reinventing and bridging the gap between virtual reality and the real world, with a tennis ball, is amazing. I enjoyed the different interpretation of the ARCADE game, along with the Teaching lessons that one can do within the app, to learn the simple basics of tennis strokes. The app will only continue to grow, and Gregory's commitment and dedication to his dream will make it a continued success as it evolves.","In terms of physics, there’s so much of a gap between real life and game, but this is the best you can get on the market if you’re looking for a bit of realism and fun","I think this is a thoroughly excellent game and could easily be a full release in its current form. Great physics, decent graphics, easy to pick up and play. I think it could easily be a 10 out of 10 with a few more features, customisability of play options, some rethinks around some of the graphics options etc, but even as-is I'd say it's a 9. I did try passing on some thoughts on the Discord channel but you seem to get met with a fair of bit of arguments over what are just ideas, but that aside I look forward to seeing how this game develops.",I like the training aspect of the app. I would like to see a serving module and also an option to play against AI as another choice instead of friends.,"It doesn't tell me in real time how much speed and spin my hits have (Eleven Table Tennis for example), and the stats at the end of the training are pretty bad, they are there just like the employers saying ""We worked."" When in the training they ask you to hit the ball near the net, you don't need to hit it in the other side of the net for it to count, if you just hit the net and the ball fall in your side of the court it is fine, which is wrong. They should make sure the ball fall in the opponent side. I can't change my grid, they force me to play with the default grip. Just rotating the controllers don't work, because it isn't ergonomic, it is a hell. So I am stuck with their default Grip, not like others' tennis games. I can't change my racket. We MUST be able to change our racket in a sim to match our real life rackets. Head size, string density, string tension, string material, and so on."
