My kids (8 & 10)and I had a lot of fun in the mask making lab and finding what new mask we would need to make to move forward. We would play it and move on to another game and then come back to it again. Mask making and putting on and taking off masks is a pretty fascinating way to move about!,"If you like to occasionally relax from all the frantic high energy VR games out there, and love exploration as much as I do then this is the game for you! Love all of the world's, and making masks is strangely very relaxing. Worth full price! Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (case matters, the comma is a dot and remove spaces): b i t , l y / M a s k m a k e r V R","An interesting game full with fortune cookie wisdom. Dye the mask, put on the shells, and disguise yourself with truth! Though do note that, contrary to some other reviews, you CAN turn off subtitles, but only from the main menu.","I won’t lie it’s an amazing game and it’s very fun but in burlap swamp there is a reoccurring glitch where when u activate the second statue it won’t register at the tower so I can’t enter the tower or re-activate the statue and I’ve reset twice but the same thing happens, it says I activated the statue but it doesn’t say that at the tower, but still an amazing game",I very much enjoy the game the visuals are amazing the mechanics are solid the story is interesting the music is very nice the voice acting is on point so overall I will recommend it if you like a nice story with a very nice puzzle system
