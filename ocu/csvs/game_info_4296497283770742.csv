The graphics were really good, and the games scary. It is not a game to consistently play but if you or you want somebody to get a quick scare, it’s a great game.","I started exploring the dark house and opened each door, some effects are really scary and some are ok. Totally worth buying and give a try. I read the review on sidequest and tried this."
