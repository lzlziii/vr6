Spice & Wolf VR2,"At the end of his journey with the wolf goddess Holo, former traveling merchant Lawrence settled down with her and opened a bathhouse. The couple was blessed with an adorable daughter and an idyllic life. However, the beautiful wolves have a weakness for delicious meals and their food expenses are a source of headaches for Lawrence. One day, as Lawrence is going about his fur side business to further fill the family's coffers, a slight incident occurs. To further complicate things, Holo saunters in with quite the feast. This is a VR Animation of Spice and Wolf: Spring Log, sequel to the original Spice and Wolf VR animation. The game has a 30 minute story and a game mode where you can watch part of the anime alongside its characters in the style of Japanese paper street theater. A peaceful life in the bathhouse with wolfgirls awaits.",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Entertainment,", Fantasy, Romance","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Japanese",1.0,Spicy Tails,Spicy Tails,https://spicy-tails.net/,"Apr 14, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5336796743005117/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5336796743005117&r=1, https://spicy-tails.net/privacy/privacy.html",609.5 MB,"Best anime game on VR!!
