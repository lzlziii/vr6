Video Modeling,"The Video Modeling application was created for students with intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders, who have so far had difficulties in developing their professional, personal and social competences. The application contains a set of videos recorded from the first person perspective, which show the scheme of performing certain actions. Anyone using the VR app can receive the following materials to work with: • table of contents of materials • general VR application instructions • instructions for using the videos • an attachment which is a sheet for recording the effects of the learning process • photo material - used as one of the forms of hint. • videos posted on the WYmodeluj channel on youtube.com First, choose an activity that the student will learn. Then download the instructions for the video - which shows how to organize the workplace. Other documents, i.e. the sheet for recording the effects of the learning process - is used to measure the student's progress, and the photographic material is a helpful hint for the learner. Selected materials should be printed or prepared in the form of a file so that you have constant access to them during work and can use them on an ongoing basis. The tool received a positive methodological opinion.",3+,Single User,"Hand Tracking, Gamepad","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Entertainment,", Education",Polish,0.6,Jakub Kreft,Justyna Bogusław oraz Magdalena Benedyk,https://wymodeluj.blogspot.com/,"Apr 5, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6041253985884618/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6041253985884618&r=1, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPGT-g_qgz0onPcCRrOl0uwHAOHIjSsL/view",183.9 MB
