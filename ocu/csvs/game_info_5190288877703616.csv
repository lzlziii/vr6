I was right outside the tower when I killed one of the guards. After killing said guard I took his rifle pulled out the mag, aimed the gun and shot a tower guard on top of the tower in the head killing him instantly. I now have the gun hung on a wall with pride.","This game really tickled my ball sack when I first played it. Idk what people are saying about bugs and stuff but it's overall a really good game and I suggest buying it. It's actually the best game on VR right now, if your going to get it back sure you get part one first thought because this game wouldn't make as much sense. The first game was really good too so don't worry.",This game is great but it would be awesome with multiplayer! They can make it to were we can join random lobby‚Äôs max players is 3 and we can give each other weapons and ammo but nobody can take anyone‚Äôs weapons off there wall there should be a up and down arrow so we can see each other‚Äôs weapon wall! This will make the game 10x better I hope the devs add this because they are good devs they actually listen to feedback to Improve their game so I hope multiplayer can be added soon!,"This game has the best gameplay of any VR game I have ever played. This game has one of the best villains in any VR game I have played so far (imo). And In this game your given WAY more weapons for more engaging combat and like the first, multiple endings which I really like. Overview: Make the game less buggy, do what you can, but, fix this game and add Multiplayer Please. Best Wishes, Cayden. 5/5 good job.","The game is good the story telling and the night mode even giving you chances to trade with exiles, also devs if you read this please try to put multiplayer, if putting mutiayer in the game it will show your community or the walking dead fans that they could show there moves of killing walkers in different ways so please devs hear your fans out and make the multiplayer option for them I love you devs and I love the game and for the walking dead fans let‚Äôs try to make a vote for how many people that want to put multiplayer in saints and sinners, love you all especially the devs ‚úåÔ∏èüëã"
