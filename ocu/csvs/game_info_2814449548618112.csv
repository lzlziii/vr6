Hatsune Miku VR,"World-famous virtual singer Hatsune Miku invites you to join her on stage in in this VR music game! Simply put on your headset, choose a song, then use your VR controllers to catch the melody symbols flying from the speakers at the back of the stage. But beware the long riff symbols and other challenges that will make it harder to reach the perfect score! Songs The following songs from popular Hatsune Miku artists are included: * Stella * Ievan Polkka * Singularity * Amagoi Miseinen * Sharing The World * Ghost Rule * SenbonZakura * Hibikasi Kei * SLoWMoTIoN * Lucky Orb Features * Rhythm action game using VR controllers * Enjoy Miku’s original dance while playing the game * 2 Miku outfits and 2 glowsticks * Ten songs with two difficulties for intense dance action * Music video mode: watch any song from multiple angles with your choice of stage and outfit",3+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Casual, Music & Rhythm","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Taiwan), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Spain)",3.01,Crypton Future Media,Komodo,http://promo.degicagames.com/vr/,"Oct 12, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2814449548618112/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2814449548618112&r=1, https://komodo.jp/",1.12 GB,"This game appears to be created by someone who just learned the basics of coding and design, and used those skills to put together this hot mess. The font itself is terrible, along with the appearance of everything. The mechanics of the game may be a feat for a beginner coder, but a loss for those who wanted gameplay. If I wanted disappointment, I could have saved my money and spend time with my family.","the reviews are accurate so far. simple game that, as a miku game, has so much potential. but is mild. music sound is low, simple gameplay. I luv miku and it's great to see her and play songs. but this is so simple and disappointing. vr should have an amazing miku experience. please, someone create something so much better, please.","If you like vocaloids and enjoy Hatsune Miku then this is a great game! I recommend you get all song updates as well as each is essentially its own new game combo. I like that you just need to touch the notes coming your way and having Miku dance in front of you makes it harder. I also own the PC version: graphics are a little better as you'd expect but you get fewer stages and songs though it's cheaper to buy. However each mode (normal/hard) is harder from the corresponding one on standalone with some exceptions. If you are a Miku/vocaloid fan, you will enjoy this.","This game is cute and all, but the actual *game* (hitting the notes) sucks and debatably works imo… I do like the music video feature, but honestly that’s the only thing that I think would be enjoyable from this game. Looks like it was very very rushed. I wouldn’t recommend it","Though there may be a balance of negative and positive reviews about this game, it’s a very good rhythm game for those who are vocaloid fans/those who want a hard Rhythm game to play not to mention there’s separate DLC for the game to purchase if you like the game a lot but get tired of playing the same songs on repeat. Throughout my gaming experience it’s safe to say that it’s quite challenging even when your playing on normal mode, making you have to react somewhat faster to hit the music notes while also dodging obstacles. One feature I suggest the game devs add is a note speed selection screen so that the notes in the songs can make it easier to react to the notes for those who just started playing the game for the first time."
