The Last Worker,"The Last Worker is an immersive narrative adventure centered around a lone worker’s last stand in an increasingly automated world, The Last Worker is a unique blend of work simulation and stealth strategic gameplay. The game is set in a lonely, oppressive but strangely beautiful environment, with characters designed by comics legend Mick McMahon. Kurt works for the world’s largest retailer and is forced to choose between capitalism or activism. Having dedicated his life to work, Kurt’s loyalty is put to the test when a group of activists ask him to dismantle Jüngle from the inside. Aboard his corporate issued flying JünglePod and armed with his multi-purpose JüngleGun, Kurt dispatches countless products from a fulfilment centre the size of the sunken city of Manhattan. Kurt (voiced by Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) has dedicated his life to Jüngle, with only his co-bot, Skew (Jason Isaacs) to keep him company. But when S.P.E.A.R., a group of activists, asks Kurt to help dismantle Jüngle from the inside, Kurt is forced to discover his employer’s dark underbelly. The Last Worker delivers an emotional, thought provoking and inspiring story with rich characters performed by an all-star cast starring, Jason Isaacs, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, Clare-Hope Ashitey, David Hewlett, Zelda Williams and Tommie Earl Jenkins.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Interactive Story","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Taiwan), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish (Spain)",1.0.8,"Offiy, Wolf & Wood",Wired Productions,https://www.thelastworker.com/,"Mar 30, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5761454780599212/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5761454780599212&r=1, https://wiredproductions.com/privacy-policy/",3.38 GB,"Beautiful narrative experience and fun gameplay where you feel like the wheel chair bound people from WALL-E except it flies! b i t , l y / T L W F r i e n d",Has a good story. Great voice acting. Nice stylistic graphics. Linear gameplay. Overall a nice experience. Taking off a star because the controls feel clunky. Made some chapters frustrating.,If you have patience and don't mind doing the same thing over and over then this game is for you. If you don't have patience then I wish you luck lol . These check points are terrible. Especially chapter 4,I am still only on the first chapter but you can see the effort and talent put into this. I thought it was maybe a light interactive story but I was wrong and I am so happy I was wrong. This is more of a game and it is fascinating.....like if Amazon and crazy taxi had a baby. Edit....I am now at the end of chapter 4 and I would put this game up there with the red matter games. I cant give enough praise to the devs and the team for putting this out there,"Five stars for the creative team, two for the technical team. The Last Worker is well written and entertaining satire with excellent art direction and voice acting, delivered in a clunky technical package. The worst technical aspect is the incomplete and misleading tutorial. For example it tells you to grab the virtual control stick. If you follow that instruction, the tutorial will not progress since the grip button locks you into strafe mode. Early on in the game you’re told to engage the boost mode on cue. Despite clicking down the left thumb stick as instructed, the boost wouldn’t engage. It took many tries to pass this scene and I’m not sure how I got past it. Either the instructions are misleading or it’s a glitch. This next issue won’t affect everyone. An inconsistent frame rate gives me motion sickness. After six years of using VR on a near daily basis, a poor frame rate is the only thing left that can still give me VR sickness. I can play driving and flying games comfortably for hours at a time, provided they run at a smooth frame rate. Unfortunately The Last Worker’s frame rate frequently hitches, especially in turns, so I have to play it in very short sessions. If they can clean up the tutorial, fix or eliminate the virtual control stick, and optimize the performance so it runs smoothly, this could be a five star game."
