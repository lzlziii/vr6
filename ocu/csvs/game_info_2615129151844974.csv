Fail Factory!,"Immerse yourself in a whimsical robot factory while climbing your way up the corporate ladder from lowly intern to esteemed star employee. In a wacky spectacle of increasing chaos, strive to keep up with the escalating comedy of errors as you operate various assembly lines in a myriad of mini-games. Entrenched in a physics-based, no consequences playground, experience three main types of mini-game stations, all with the goal to help the factory build robots on a massive scale. Working in assembly stations, sorting stations and quality assurance protocol (QAP), where youâ€™ll control unfathomably large robots, youâ€™ll hone your skills in a factory that feels reactive and alive, allowing for a fully immersive experience. Designed with approachability in mind, ridiculous failure is inevitable as you work your way to the top in this vibrant, witty and comedic stress-inducing Fail Factory!.",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Mexico)",1.0,Armature Studio,Oculus,http://armature.com/games/failfactory,"Jan 16, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2615129151844974/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2615129151844974&r=1, https://armature.com/games/failfactory/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,1.23 GB,"""Your â‚¬6.27 in credit is expiring soon.

Basically any one can play and have fun even if you have 5 years of experience on vr.","Fail Factory is an affordable app that provides a good challenging selection of minigames that showcase the various functionalities of the controllers. Certain minigames have the user using a tractor beam of sorts to grab coloured blocks and then these blocks have to be launched into corresponding coloured barrels (highly reminiscent of the portal gun used in Valve's Portal game series). Other minigames have the user using an overhead claw in order to pick up pieces and these pieces have to then be positioned and/or dropped in order to build something (such as a motor or robot for example). Other minigames have the user piloting the legs and torso of a large robot (seen from a fixed position far away from said robot) in order to lead the robot through an obstacle course of sorts. The user is rated on a 3-star scale for the precision and efficacy that each stage is completed. The game can be played through in a seated position, with the need to rotate more than 120 degrees only appearing in later sections of the game (using a rotating office chair is ideal). Humour and animation quality play a big role in Fail Factory - the characters remind me a lot of Illumination's Minions characters. My favourite soundtrack element has smooth jazz muzak playing in the transports that shuttle the user from one stage to the next (which is highly reminiscent of the music playing over the PA system in the shopping malls of the Dead Rising series of games). Should the user rush through the game, achieving 1-2 star performances for each stage, a playthrough of this game can be completed within 2 hours, but wanting to perfect your level completion with 'perfect' designations (which go beyond 3-stars) will have the user replaying this game for far more hours. I paid the very affordable ""full price"" for this app and I feel I got my money's worth. Small footnote: a big ""Hey Now!"" goes out to the dev who titled one of the achievable ranks in-game ""Sauce On Side""."
