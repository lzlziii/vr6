After playing it for a couple of hours, I can confidently say that I'll be buying the first part. Here's what I appreciate about the game: - The bouncing locomotion is surprisingly satisfying. - The difficulty level is well-balanced, providing just the right amount of challenge. - The comic-style graphics are unique. - The game constantly introduces new features, keeping the experience fresh. - Even when you encounter obstacles and die, it feels like a learning experience. - The sound (especially during fights) is super immersive. - The logic puzzles are a welcome addition. - The flight and shooting mechanics are well-executed - need more of that! - The game world is large, although it can be easy to lose your way sometimes. - The VR experience didn't cause any dizziness, which can sometimes be a concern. - On top of all that, I haven't encountered any bugs. I highly recommend this game! EDIT: I just completed the game, and I haven't changed my opinion on it. I still think the game is excellent, and I wholeheartedly encourage others to buy it. Devs: The respawn mechanic after death can be a bit disorienting at times. Please ensure that when the player respawns, they are facing the same direction as before. There were instances when I respawned and ended up going in the wrong direction, which took a few minutes to figure out. It would greatly improve the gameplay experience. Additionally, consider adding an objective marker on the minimap. This would help a lot and save the player some time wandering around the ship. Thank you!","This game takes everything good about yupitergrad, like puzzles, mechanics, level design, graphics, animations, etc. And multiples the budget by like 10! First off, I want to talk about the combat. So, in the sequel, you will be fending off against evil robots. To rebel against them, you will use two different weapons. A one-shot explosion gun and a minigun. The minigun has a way faster fire rate but does less damage and the same thing, but flip floped for the other weapon. The combat is fun but can get a little repetitive at times. Next on the list is level design! So this games level design is basically more yupitergrad. Most of the levels have identical level design ideas. But there are some levels that are just huge arenas that you fight in. There's also puzzle levels. Open World! This game is basically an open world game! It'll let you go wherever you want to do missions. You have to find ways around. And unlock more of the map. This will leave you finding secrets and revisited rooms multiple times throughout the campaign. New Level Themes! The new level themes include a lava theme, a construction theme, a cargo theme, a plant theme, and more! Easy 9.5/10 for me definitely a must buy!","I played the first Yupitergrad and it quickly became my favorite game of all time. I was worried about the sequel, I felt it had a LOT to live up to, and at first I wasn't a fan of the gun mechanics I saw in the trailer. But it blew my expectations out of the water. The swinging and level design is better than ever, and AIsha is a great companion through the game. The gun mechanics ended up being perfectly executed, making for an exhilarating addition to the game. This sequel literally could not have been better. Thank you gamedust!","Honestly, I've been waiting for the sequel for about 4 months after I beat the first game, and this is amazing! If there is going to be a yupitergrad 3, I have a few suggestions: -set on a space station outside of Neptune. - even more cool adjustments to our cosmosticks, like a customisation booth or something. -More of ayesha! She's such a good character, with her dad jokes! Overall a fantastic experience, so keep up the good work!",It starts slow to get you adjusted. By the end your swinging around like Spider-Man with a gun. It is an amazing game from start to finish . The backtracking can be a little annoying but by the time you have to backtrack you have developed your skills so itâ€™s easy. This and the first episode I see as a list buy. I put this in the high quality category like budget cuts and to the top(amazing ). Please make more like this.
