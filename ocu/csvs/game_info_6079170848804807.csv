Maze of Magic,"You find yourself in a treacherous 3D maze, filled with lurking enemies around every corner. Your goal is to locate keys scattered throughout the maze to unlock the elusive exit. Be strategic in your approach as you utilize a variety of powerful spells, such as Magic Missile for offense, Magic Shield for defense, or X-Ray Vision to see through walls. But be mindful, as each spell comes with its own costs and effects. As you navigate the maze, keep an eye on your health and collect regenerative potions to stay alive. Monitor your progress with metrics that track enemies defeated, keys found, and spells learned. But time is of the essence, so be swift and decisive in your actions. Can you triumph over the maze's challenges and make your escape? The fate of your survival rests in your hands. Good luck on this thrilling journey!",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Arcade, Puzzle",English,1.22,D3DXR,D3D,https://www.d3dxr.com/,"Apr 14, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6079170848804807/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6079170848804807&r=1, https://www.d3dxr.com/privacy",224.7 MB,"This game has so much potential. The maze is fun and challenging to get through. There’s utility spells that help you get through the maze, avoiding traps or destroying a wall to make a new path. Can’t wait for the maze generator feature! Awesome little game you can just spend hours playing without realizing.",Fun game with a lot of potential. I like how you have to look at the spell scroll and memorize the order of buttons to press in order to cast spells. Excited to see what the next update is gonna be!,"This game really is a lot of fun!
