Just join our discord server https://tele.tennis/discord for a free key :),I like the way the controller vibrates when you hit the ball - very authentic. I would love to have a training mode to focus on aspects of my gameplay as I am currently too bad at the game to play a decent match. Sure the environment will improve as this is still very early beta. I see a lot of potential here.,"First, thank you developers for this VR tennis, it is a good start. My suggestions to improve the gameplay Need training mode for forehand, backhand, overhead service, ( backhand and overhead service are not easy ) Hitting targets mode if possible, because it is fun . The background environment is too simple and basic. The moving clouds around the tennis court are useless to the gameplay. The TV screen on top of the net is not good placement, please places on the side or behind the player. Are there option to turn off the voice , because I just have to look at the TV screen , also the TV screen should show more useful information , ( eg, ball IN or OUT information , ) . Player name . Please continue to improve the game , game development is fun but it is not easy too.","As a two handed backhand player, found it difficult to execute on the backhand - if the ball can be dropped on the racket hand this would be ideal (I would use one controller to drop the ball and immediately drop the controller to focus both hands on the racket) An option to allow for the bot to initiate the first ball for return practice"
