The over arching story an absolute joy which brought me to tears on more than one occasion, This is a game I won't ever forget, it touched me very deeply.","Just finished the game and was happy I played it. It's a good game to relax and take your time in, reading all the notes, and listening to all the narrative parts to the end. I never looked at one of the in game hints, but did look at an ign.com guide one time to get out of a place where I was stuck. That was far better than watching a video. There are a couple of places I wish I had saved game spots: one at the end where you need to make your choice (so that you can see the other ending, too), and one at an underwater part where she says ""The current is really strong here"", since the next part is very fun and would be neat to repeat a couple of times. I loved the length of the game, and felt it made an excellent VR port. Also, watch the credits at the end all the way through, since there is a little more after they're done (as well as a cute baby picture). Plus, the song they sing at the end (Dear Old Pal of Mine from 1918) is lovely. You can find an old recording of it online if you search. Anyway, it was an engaging story, which I greatly enjoyed.","So, I'm almost to the end of this game an I wasn't sure if I should purchase due to some complaints, BUT as soon as someone said it was up there with RED Matter I & II, I had to try it. I absolutely love the whole thing! Except one thing but I'll get to that. The island, the caves, the underwater, all very well done and beautiful! Story was a little weird but at the end parts, I can see why there is black ooze. I will play this many times. I love that I can just walk around an there is no hurry. I hope there will be more in the future! Only complaint is, I play games in sitting mode but for this game, there were many times where I was too tall to reach things. It became very annoying when I had to put my hand on the dream platforms or to go through passages. My hand would be very far away when it should just be right there, reachable. I hope you can fix that. Again, I really enjoy this game and good job!!!","Absolutely loved this. I was initially worried that it would be another short one, having been burned by A fisherman's tale, but this was wonderful. Everything I want from a story-driven adventure. Good, environment-based puzzles with just the right level of difficulty, hunting for clues, stellar voice acting and a really charming and moving story at its centre. I hope the developer will bring us something just as amazing in the future. These are the kind of games VR is MADE for in my opinion. It's a reasonable length and leaves you feeling very satisfied in the end. I like that the two endings are easily viewable so you can experience both and decide which one you prefer. Too often, developers make this too difficult and it just leaves me with decision anxiety. When a story is this good, I'd usually prefer just one ending. I've played a lot of great games this year - This now easily sits alongside Red Matter as one of the best","I completed this game on PC so thought it would be worth trying in VR. The main problem I'm finding is that paying in both seated and teleport modes means that I can never get close enough to items that I need to pick up, so have to lean almost out of the guardian area. The game needs a fine movement option on the right stick. Also the distance grab is temperamental, sometimes it let's me grab items, other times it doesn't appear and I have to struggle to bend and pick it up."
