Detour Bus Demo,"ARRIVING SUMMER 2022 THIS DEMO INCLUDES THE FIRST LEVEL OF DETOUR BUS Detour Bus is a VR construction-comedy adventure, where you build ridiculous winding highways, to take the dysfunctional Flowers family on a road trip across Post-Infrastructure America. Nostalgia junkie Daddy Flowers aims to revive his family's bonds before the end of summer vacation, but stuck together in a restored microbus, workaholic Momma, communist-in-training Junior, and social-media-baby Goldie have a lot more to fight about than unite over. Meanwhile, the open road is under threat; you'll have to get in the construction groove to take on corrupt Senator Joseph McCarthiefâ€™s attempts to turn all freeways into pay-to-drive tunnels and reclaim your right to transportation.
