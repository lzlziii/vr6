I love the different characters+ really good if you’re a rocky fan. And all for a good price. Definitely a buy 👍 Bit(dot)ly/OculusDisc Replace the (dot) with a period for tons of coupons Please like the post it really helps!!!,"I see a lot of reviews saying “oh you can’t even crouch” “too much bugs” etc. please, don’t listen to them. This game is the best boxing game out there and does not apply too all the 1 star reviews. This game is really amazing and multiplayer is litterally the funnest thing ever.","My 2 cents: Multiplayer is the biggest draw, hands down. Until TOTF 2 surfaces, Creed is the only game in town. But devs please consider the following changes to MP: - disable stick movement. Too many users just fly around and punch you in the back of the head because they don’t know how/don’t want to block. This is a boxing game, not street fighter. - make endurance mode the default for MP. Doesn’t make sense your avatars arms get tired before yours do. - add ranked matches. Would be fun to track your progress. Maybe even add belts or awards. Or at least win/loss, KO records - punch damage is a little too high maybe tone it down by a couple points. Not sure if it’s based on velocity or what but needs to be tweaked. Compare with TOTF. - get rid of the stun thing where you have to raise your arms to recover. I don’t get what the point of that is - if a fighter gets on you, ref should break it up. Again compare with TOTF - make punching someone in the back of the head or below the belt illegal. Or at the very least again, disable stick movement so players can’t exploit it.",I just got this game yesterday and it’s still downloading and I see people saying the update is bad and now I think I wasted my money It downloaded its really glitchy and when I punch my arms get struck in the air but it still is fun Never mind it’s better now😀
