This could be such a good game but the lack of recent reviews or info about updates makes me think it's going to be one of those games that gets into App Lab and becomes too much of a hassle to maintain or update. There is no teleport. It's all smooth motion. Which is really not good if you get motion sickness. Teleport should always be an option. Controls are clumsy and if you drop the water gun or anything on the ground, there's no way to pick it up for some weird reason. I had to close the game and start again because reaching to the ground did not retrieve the items that fell. You should not have to go back to the station to pick a nozzle or foam. They should be cycled through with the thumbstick or button. All the moving around to change nozzles is really a pain. You have no idea when the car is fully washed. No indicator that you're done or how far along you are. Trying to grip the wax and waxer was frustrating. Dropped the can of wax, had to quit out of the game to retrieve it. You cannot play sitting down, which is a mistake. These types of games are usually a very zen type experience but this one is just too frustrating to navigate.","It's a simplistic game that accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's a nice calm and fun time in an environment that feels good to be in. Unlock upgrades and tools along the way for more fun! There are minor improvements and additions that could be made to add to immersion such as a touch screen and tool holster instead of the floating bubbles in the air. If it were possible, seeing the sections of the car that you finish sparkle would really help too with letting the player know they can move on! Thank you for the fun game!",I got the game everything going well the whole car cleaned and there's still some cracks that won't clean no matter what and I can't finish it without them maybe devs cut a bit of slack and let us do not spotless if not fixed I'm gonna refund sorry,I rate it a four because I donâ€™t know how to pass the tutorial,the game is oddly satisfying!! never thought i would like washing this much!! Kudos to the dev
