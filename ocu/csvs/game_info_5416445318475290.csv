That said, give this demo a try and enjoy what it gives you. Five stars for doing AR right. You use hands to interact with the game which is great, but I would suggest having control interface as an option. I also love that we can easily move the play field anywhere in our room. It captures the PvZ feel perfectly if that's what you're looking for, though as I said I do hope they expands it in its own direction.","The update was awesome but now I need more levels! Haha, so much fun!","The hand tracking isn't that great yet, and the and the transparent hands are kinda very distracting when using controllers. Also it might be a bit too easy to pull unwanted plants out. Also, I'd love to have lawnmowers too, just like one might have seen somewhere else :D","Great tech implementation. Easy to pick up and play, fun to progress. Comfortable to play in familiar surroundings or be present when others are involved","Good work i need to play final versi√≥n, consider to add levels via update. Finger tracking its a good option. Please put move gizmo cube position in a corner 20cm over the ground."
