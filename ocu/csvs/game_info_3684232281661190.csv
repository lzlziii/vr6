Flux Ball,"Why stop with pivots and squats? Flux Ball pressures the player to lie flat and tumble out of sticky situations, constantly moving between standing, crouching and prone positions. Engage in a close quarters shoot out using your Guard Cage for protection from enemy fire. When struck, your cage will be lowered into a liquid container, drowning those who fall too far down. Flux Ball is best played on fitness mats and/or a rug. Come test your Flux Ball skills...",7+,Single User,Touch (as Gamepad),"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Sports",English,1.0,"Lifted Line, LLC","Scrimage Entertainment, LLC",https://www.scrimageent.com/,"Jul 16, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3684232281661190/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3684232281661190&r=1, https://www.scrimageent.com/FluxBallPrivacyPolicy",1.22 GB,I like guns so I got it I like everything in the game ￼,"My next choice is an odd one. With a high level of difficulty and an almost ""work-out like"" experience; Flux Ball is a shoot-em-up sport unlike anything I've ever played. Almost impossible to compare to another title as it's so creative in it's conception and very hard to explain....I will certainly try. Because in spite of their trying, the game does not do a very good job of laying it out for you lol. Graphically I find it the right level of dark and edgy with the sport like element thrown in. It's unique to say the least but you'll hear me say that a lot. Because everything in this game is quite unique. I enjoy it, it doesn't stutter and serves it's purpose well. The music matches the graphics and for the first few hours or maybe even days, you'll enjoy jamming out to it. Check the preview to get an idea of what you'll be hearing. Real tracks from real musicians. Refreshing. It does get repetitive however as there are only so many songs but it is a truly great soundtrack. The controls can be described as this; be a ninja. Prepare to channel your reflexes to be instantaneous. X to go down, Y to go up. But you must tap them quickly to go either direction. Grip with your left hand to catch, grip with your right hand to make your gun appear. While holding grip, trigger makes you fire. Not holding grip pressing trigger uses your rocket punch. Releasing grip and re-pressing grip while your gun spins will automatically reload. Still following all this? As you can see this game has a steep learning curve. But it's worth it and I'll explain why and how we put that all together to win. Always shoot the red enemies first. They're your threat, they will cost you points. Upon shooting an enemy a Flux ball will come hurling from them. Catch the ball with your left hand and shoot the coin that appears with your right....if you can. You can also make field goals by either shooting the ball between the uprights or rocket punching it through. HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART. You lose catches/points by getting hit/shot. So dodging up and down and shooting the red threats is critical. Catch balls. Shoot guys. Make field goals. Dodge bullets. Jam out. When you get the hang of it, it is really really fun. Sorry the review is late but I wanted to give it a fair shot and some time to really learn. Here's the bad part. The game isn't updated....or at least hasn't been in a long time. So my hope's for new tracks or refinements moving up and down are doubtful. All the same there's alot to have fun with here for free! You should definitely see if you have what it takes and pick up Flux Ball! Hours of fun to be had!",This game is like one of those dance games that you can find an arcade it’s an active shooter game mixed with baseball and tries to get you to work out but in a good way this game is absolutely amazing,"Very Active dev team, Listens to the people, constant clockwork updates, competitive, flashy with the fluxballs to back it up, I have been a daily user of quest since the release of the quest 1 but this is my first review ever and Im going to tell you there is NOTHING LIKE THIS GAME.... A gun, a glove, and a willingness to destroy anything that moves for the thirst of flux is all you need I've been playing this since i found it and its my daily game no BS and i own half the store of games so that should tell you something..... KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK! I look forward to hearing from you DEVS!",Just another app cluttering my not installed list.
