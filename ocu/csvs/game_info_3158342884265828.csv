The devs of this program have developed an app that isn't a game...it's an experience. It is meant to relax you, to energize you, to help you focus and if needed help heal your soul. I admit, playing for free, going through the questionnaire at the end of each experience is a little tedious but the answers help the devs understand how each app affects each user. I have nothing but praise fo r them and this program. I am spending the 5 dollars a month to skip the questions and because it IS that good of a program. I highly recommend this app.","Over a few months, I have increasingly incorporated Liminal into my daily routine. While using the app ,I have come to know what to expect as an experience proceeds. But, I am always surprised by my different responses to the same stimulus. This app has become my go to for assistance in managing my moods.","The perfect after-work-meditation-tool. Even Liminals home-environments of the different mood-categories spread a very relaxing ambience - and the different experiences get better and better. ""Sojourn"" (one of the latest), for example, is an amazing alliance of visuals and sound.",Let's get one thing straight. I absolutely LOVE this app. I had to take away a star though because I noticed within the last month that it's not rotating the experiences like its supposed to. I play this every day and it goes through its little update rotation (once a week) but MAY give me ONE new experience in a random category. Within the last month I may have seen 2 new experiences with the rest remaining the same. I'll have to keep hope alive that the devs are on this and fixes are coming soon. If not I'm sure I'll get bored of the experiences and maybe uninstall it with hesitation. -UPDATE- First a little side note. Whoa! I wrote this review at 4:00 a.m. and had a response by 9:00 a.m. from the devs. THAT'S customer service folks! As per the reply from the devs it turns out that there are only so many experiences in the rotation (for now) and that I am using it so regularly that I am seeing the same experiences. That is a fair assessment seeing that I really only play with the awe and energy categories. I have tested relief and calm but those are my two favorites üòÅ. For the sensible explanation and a speedy response I am giving it back it's fifth star!,"Each time I sign in to Liminal VR, I can't help noticing deeper layers of artistic talent, as if entering an art gallery. Their talent pool may be from the visual arts, but I sense incredible fine art skills."
