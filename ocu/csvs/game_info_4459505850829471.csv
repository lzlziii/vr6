BattleGroupVR,"BattleGroupVR is a first-person real-time space strategy where you lead a fleet into battle from the bridge of your own flagship. As the battle group commander, you are part of the battle fighting alongside your chosen captains and warships. Unlock different types of ships, each with their own unique special abilities, load-outs, and configurations. From fast striking corvettes, electronic warfare science vessels, dangerous carriers, and powerful battleships. All are at your command. Units and ships grow with you on your conquests, losing them is a heavy burden. Select your captains wisely, each individual captain will bring a benefit ability to your fleet, which paired with the right ship, can turn the tide of battle. Direct your forces against the enemy! Made specifically for VR, unique real-time strategy controls have been created to facilitate the command of a 3D space combat environment.",16+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Space/Universe, Strategy",English,30,SpaceOwl Games,SpaceOwl Games,https://spaceowl.games/,"Jul 1, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4459505850829471/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4459505850829471&r=1, https://spaceowl.games/privacy-policy/",1.01 GB,"I am many hours in and in love with this game. I don't even particularly like RTS games. But I bought it because I love space. The POV you get in this game is so cool and I fell in love with the gameplay along the way. Worth every penny. Or get it cheaper (the comma is a dot and caps matter): b i t , l y / B G V R Q u e s t","I love fleet command games and this is in space, combining two awesome things, 11/10 would recommend","It has great graphics and is a really good rts game while the campaign is short it comes with many extra stuff such as conquest,skirmish and multiplayer","Super fun game. Controlling your fleet is slightly complicated at first but once you get it, becomes muscle memory. It's awesome looking out your bridge and seeing the battle take place as you coordinate it. Even your command ship is involved. Just nails everything with a great atmosphere. Some occasional bugs, mainly with wi dow placement, or not being able to get ships in reverse to go forwards again. But we'll worth the small hiccups. Give it a try","Very fun and immersive, but not overcomplicated. The voice commands are great once you get used to them, and being able to look out the window at the battle makes it seem more real. Great game!"
