This is so trippy and exciting! Also here’s 10 thing’s you should add! 1. Add a Hand menu! 2. If you can add a body! There are Video’s on YouTube on how to do that! 3. Add Basic physic’s! 4. Add object’s you can pick up like a cup or something! 5. Add a Basic Inventory 6. This is optional but Add a Objective! 7. Add some UI! Make sure it is on the hand because it’s immersion breaking if it is on the face! 8. Add a Tutorial! 9. Add a Slide option for movement! 10. Add turning with the Right Thumb Stick!,"Truly glorious. So incredibly cool and artsy, and unless colorful modern art dealies with funny imagery isn't your thing, then you don't like VR. This hit the spot something fierce, and is more or less my idea of a perfect VR experience. I'm dazzled."
