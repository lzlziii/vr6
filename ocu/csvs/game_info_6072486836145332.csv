Obius,"Obius is an instrument for creating interesting and highly complex sounds for music production or film sound design. Obius is a serious tool for any music producer or sound designer, and it's easy to create interesting soundscapes with the preset collections. The basic idea is that instead of playing single note with keyboard, a sequence is played. XR user interface makes the sequence editing easy, fun and creative. Obius sound creation is sample based, but it could be better decspribed as ""sequence synthesis"". All samples are coming from authentic analog or acoustic sources recorded with highly professional vintage and contemporary gear. Best way of include Obius in your workflow is to plug your headsets analog 3,5mm lineoutput in your I/O, just like you would do with an external synthesizer.

On the right side there is a cube for recording harmonies that you are doing with the keyboard. Say something you don't like, you just have to press the wrong note and that's it, it disappears. It is an app that grows as you discover it. congratulations to the developer. and waiting for updates where more sounds can be added. I hope the developer includes tutorials inside the app. how to change compasses? l"
