There’s a variety in environments, but all I care about is the size of the screen. Larger is better. Something more cozy would be nice though.","No complains with the current condition of this app asside from very minor polish. Has several environments that you can move between. Setting up a space to view Pluto content with friends was easy and noone had trouble joining. The on screen sync between everyone was close but not perfect. Not enough that we weren't watching essentially the same spot in the movie we chose. Not a fan of the 3D menus personally, but always good to try something new and you can easily switch to 2D menus. Can't wait to see this moved up to the main app store so that I can more easily recommend to friends.",Finally social VR television. This is a great app with lots of room to grow.,This is an awesome addition to the Movie/TV VR app genre. I can’t brag on it enough. I love Bigscreen and now I have another app to add to my favs! Keep these coming!,"I would give this 5 stars if they had an environment that felt more comfortable since I was having a hard time finding a good place to center myself to watch something. Also, a dark environment with minimal lighting should be an option to get that cinematic feeling going. Another idea to consider is to have a drive in environment. Other that, this is great. I think this will be my go to for tv and movie watching in vr."
