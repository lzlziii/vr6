The dungeons never get boring the gameplay is crazy I catch myself sweating hard sometimes trying to clear these things the games insane!!! Replace the ‚Äúdot‚Äù with a period bitdotly/Mattysharky Leave a like if it helps please!!!!!!!,"This game is already way better than Blades and Sorcery: Nomad and BoneLab with fun levels and good / creative weapons, but one wish that I would litteraly die for is for this game to be multiplayer. This might be hard or not possible to make but I'd love for you guys to give it a shot! Like possible 2v1s against bosses or even better a 1v1 mode! Overall this game is a 10/10 with good combat and good enemies that give a good challenge!","‚û°Ô∏èquestlinks.bio.link‚¨ÖÔ∏è Pls leave a like before you go get it üôåüèª This is the Fantasy combat game you are looking for, more than 80 different enemies variants and if that not enough you can find more in mods. You play blade and sorcery and have doubts on buying this? Just buy it, its a very different experience that might not have the same stuff but you will find new things which you will love more. Hey! Where you going without leaving the üëçüèª, help a brother out ü•∫","UPDATE: When you jump off a few times, it will say something, but you have to drop weapons that it specifies. Because I saw a golden statue and you throw a weapon down there, then it requires another and another, and I got to the point where it said throw down something with writing or something? All in all, keep progressing through the story, and buy the equipment and throw it off until (I supposed) you unlock the mod menu(?). SPOILER!!! The last item is the tablet. When you first spawn, there is a long tablet that shows you the news on the wall (something square with writing), yank it off the wall, throw it off the cliff, jump down, talk to the dog, and mod menu will be on your right wrist and then you unlock the cheat menu! You will see Mod.Io, you click that when you open up your right wrist menu to access mods."
