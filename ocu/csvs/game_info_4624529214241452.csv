We need more of these types of experiences on the main store. All of the horror-themed stuff and mindless shooters are getting a bit tired. I love when devs try something new and bring new experiences to VR. That said, I think it does need some work on the look of the scenes with the actors. There is a weirdness to the 360 video that makes the people hard to focus on and makes me a bit nauseous. I really love the actors and that’s a great part of the experience, but please fix the 360 so it’s not so stomach churning. I found myself wishing for the game parts to start because the 360 video was giving me a headache! I don’t want to dread a part of the experience. If they can fix this I will update my review and recommend to friends as well. Great start though! Update: What a thoughtful response from the Devs! I really appreciate your response. I can’t wait to try the game again this weekend.","PLEASE, I BEG YOU: I simply love this type of games and I love Sherlock Holmes but I am not a native speaker. I am not going to ask you to translate the voice but, at least, insert English subtitles! It should be quite inexpensive and it could permit to almost everyone to enjoy the game (it is not an arcade: every word must be understood!!!)",This was an incredibly fun experience that made me feel like I was in an interactive theater performance. I really enjoyed the great acting and piecing together the clues. I can't wait to try with friends!,Please can you fix the map when I press the map I can't go any further is a bug on the map so please can you fix it
