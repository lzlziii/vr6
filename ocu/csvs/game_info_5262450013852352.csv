Farming Tractor,"Farming Tractor is a VR adventure game that lets players experience real-life driving and farming on farm. In addition to growing plants, feeding animals, and other farm activities, players can now enjoy two new categories: Modern Drone Farming and Risky Roads. In Modern Drone Farming, players can operate a flying drone to survey the farm area, sprinkle pest control, and even shoot wild animals. This new feature provides a realistic drone operating experience for players. In Risky Roads, players will face thrilling adventures as they navigate their tractor through risky off-road paths while completing various tasks. Furthermore, we have also added a new feature that lets players experience night farming. With the backdrop of a dark and stormy night, players can immerse themselves in the sound of chirping crickets and the occasional flash of lightning. As always, players can access a tutorial to better understand the game, and enjoy nature-themed music and unique graphics animations.

It has a few issues graphics are a bit flat, audio comes in and out, Settings dont save. Apart from that you have some fun tasks to do around the farm like drivingthe tractor, milking cows feeding chickens. Wish there was more of an option to decide what tasks you want to do rather then you cannot continue till one task is finished. Spent all the money on fuel for the tractor so not sure why it doesnt last. The characters feel flat and non responsive just walk straight through you and alot of the items inthe game just jump around and doesnt move like it should. With some updates this could be a great simulator but for now its just a bit of janky fun.",I think this game has a lot of potential. I like all the different activities you can do and it could be something that can keep you occupied for hours. I am a longtime user of the oculus and there has not been a game that has made me motion sick until this game. Iâ€™m only taking 1 star off for that as it seems to be an ongoing issue and the game is still in development. I feel reluctant to start up the game again as I tried my best to give it a good go but ultimately I had to quit early because of the motion sickness. I hope that the development team is able to fix this as it could be a really fun game.,"The game is growing good, many jobs to do in the farm with many interactions. The only aspect to fix urgently is the camera behavior when driving the tractor, looks like we don't have a neck to stabilize the bumping path, like if we have the head mounted on the tractor's seat. This makes the experience a pain for motion sickness. ðŸ¤¢",This was a fun and realistic experience. Feels like I'm really driving. The graphics are ok and I would definitely play this again.,Has great potential. With everyday update it gets better
