Hands of Globzop,"You are Globzop. That's not an insult, that's your name. You are a Generator. You come from a long line of Generators. You may be an alien, a robot, a mutant....frankly we couldn't decide. You have the ability to generate (hence the name) energy from ordinary objects by creating a conduit between identical structures. You do this through the use of your hands. They are super nifty. You will take various assignments throughout the scenarios we could think up, bringing similar objects together. It's a great job, which is why you don't get paid anything.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Casual, Puzzle",English,1.0029,Wumborg,Wumborg,https://wumborg.wixsite.com/wumborg,"Jun 7, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4704511419659685/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4704511419659685&r=1, https://wumborg.wixsite.com/wumborg/privacy-policy",1.13 GB,Sometimes it's just the simplest of ideas that make the best games. This is a must have and I'm certain my kids will love this!!! Catch me playing this on my Facebook group - Ridoculus - Oculus / Meta Quest Gaming,"Video review here: https://youtu.be/Ctnh7ywmClU This game deserves lots of attention, it's a simple concept but done in such an interesting and varied way that it never gets boring. I cover the first 5 levels but there are apparently 51 more, wow! Highly recommended!"
