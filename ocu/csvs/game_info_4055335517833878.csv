The Music is so cool and fits with the game play, that unlike other games, you won't want to turn it down! Adore the Intro, so much!! LOL The controls might take some getting used to , but once you get it you'll be like...Cool! It is so unique and just makes it more fun. I Highly recommend this game. So much Fun! So that means..... Whoop, Whoop, let's Get A-Mazed!!!","It's a novel idea of a spaceship puzzle shooter inside a maze. It's a game that takes full advantage of VR's ability to give a sense of depth to a game. This is really one of those games where if you look a flat video of it, it doesn't tell the full story. And speaking of story, it also has a lot of personality, communicated though the cartoony cutscenes and excellent voice acting. It's not a perfect game, my main complaint would be that it is a bit on the shorter side - a lot of the gameplay after that comes from speedrunning the levels, something that might not appeal to everyone. What's there though is really fun!",This game took some getting used to with the different views and controls but that’s also what makes it interesting. You control the ship with one hand and maneuver yourself around the ship/maze with the other hand. The controls also caused some frustration though as I couldn’t move myself fast enough to keep up with the ship or have time to maneuver myself to see while at the same time shooting tons of enemies. I still kept getting drawn in though to try to beat my times and get through faster. You can also upgrade to different ships with different stats to try to speed your time up and at the same time utilize a few different weapons to accommodate you. I did have one glitch where as soon as I went through a portal I was transported outside of the maze. I was able to fly around and shoot enemies but couldn’t get back inside the maze. I finally decided to let myself get shot in hopes I would transfer back in and it worked. I was put back in the maze and was able to continue on in the game. Overall this is a great game with some bugs and controls to be worked on to get it up to the 5 star rating.,"This hidden gem, makes me feel like I'm playing a game inside a cartoon. Story is fun, game is challenging and fun. The only personal issue I had wasn't the game itself, it was the controls for non dominate hand. I had some difficulties with orienting myself with the ship. You rotate with your buttons, I'm so used to using the thumb stick. A great time will be had in this game. Definitely recommend.","When I first played Shuttle maze it surprised me how good it was. Graphics are so good, everything is sharp and this is very important for a game where you must see what's going next on your route. It has a short campaing which is nice but as said it's very short. I'd like to have more stages added to the campaing in the future. It also has time trial stages that make the game replayable to beat others times. It would be nice to have a stage creation tool to let players create their own stages and share to others. The only bad thing about the game is that I lost my game progress 2 times after updating the game."
