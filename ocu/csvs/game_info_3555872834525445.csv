Stopped playing after 4 levels though due to control issues. The angle on the swords felt slightly off. I kept having to strain my wrist too far forward to get a nice clean downward strike. Giving it a bit more of a forward tilt or, even better, the option to adjust the angle of the swords coming out of the controllers would be fantastic. The reloading was really unintuitive. Seemed like I needed to fully empty the clip to reload, and then the reload triggering was unreliable. Having a button or motion to empty the clip and allow for reload (like Zombieland) would be a welcome improvement. Some sort of visual indicator would have been really helpful to locate out of view projectiles. (Doubly so if this is meant to be playable by hearing impaired users.) Overall, if you're not gonna shell out cash to play SuperhotVR, this is an OK experience in its current state. Hope the developers keep at it because it's got potential!","It's awesome how you can hold swords backhanded! I just have two complaints: there is no left-handed mode for vision; when I tried to look through the sniper scope with my left eye, it was blurry, but with my right eye it was clear. The second is that I'd like to only compete against my own personal score, as it's discouraging to continually hear I failed against a stranger online when I was never intending to compete anyways. Will update if either of these is addressed.",It is fun fighting the robots!,"Did not get much enjoyment playing this. After playing for about an hour, I found there's nothing really here that made me want to come back and have another go. You have to wait for the bullets to run out before you can reload, and while that's true in the real world, in the gaming world I want to reload whenever I want to. The sniping levels are infuriating and couple that with having to reload after every shot, I wanted the sniping levels to end asap! This is my opinion, and judging by the game's score, I am in the minority. It's cheap, and I rarely ask for refunds on cheap games, so I may give this another go in the future.","I just spent three hours trying to do this one sniper challenge and I still have not beat it because of shaky hands, I do not recommend this game at all"
