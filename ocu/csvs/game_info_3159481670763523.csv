I've been up to 24 gold metals and still nothing. When does it end? What's the prize? No info ANYWHERE,Like others have said would be nice to see some new tracks or a sequel,"Visit linktr,ee/gaving7095 for 25 % off many Oculus titles üòÄ The tracks are pretty fun and the price is fair. Overall this is a very basic & forgettable experience though IMO which is why I couldn‚Äôt give it 5 stars."
