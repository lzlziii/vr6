Crystal Rift,"A grid-based dungeon-crawler, in classic first person perspective. Crystal Rift is an inspired by classic dungeon games such as Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder with grid-based movement. Itâ€™s an experiential horror challenge game that takes the player through a series of increasingly mysterious locations. Crystal Rift has 26 levels, with unique styles and settings, to provide many hours of gameplay. The player slowly uncovers the narrative and story through exploration, discovering dark secrets and following the path of those who have come before.",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Adventure, Horror, Puzzle",English,1.69,Psytec Games Ltd,Psytec Games Ltd,http://www.crystalrift.com/,"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6215608355155107/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6215608355155107&r=1, http://www.crystalrift.com/privacy/",Terms of Service,939.9 MB,It loaded one time looked cool but the settings didn't work properly and it would never Start again don't know who to tell this to but It loads to a cell half In the floor and does nothing but that only after several Uninstalls and over atemts ..still can't play because it won't start up properly..,"Great dungeon game. It has a fantastic atmosphere, which is also created by the good music and sound design. The graphics are decent, the enemies look good and are very well animated. The combat fits the style of the game - but it's not for players who want full immersion. It's indeed the combat system of a classic dungeon crawler, as well as the grid-based movement. The levels are diverse: some hidden areas, lots to collect, puzzles to solve, traps to avoid, enemies to fight, and much more. Update for devs: Another save game worked for the dragon. TLDR; A great classic dungeon game - a must for fans of grid-based movement. 4.5/5",The game is neat. You can move the sword around and also swipe with the trigger button. I especially like the audio.
