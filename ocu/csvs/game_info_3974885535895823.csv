First Steps With Hand Tracking,"If you’re a developer, you should check out how hand tracking can replace your Touch Controller experience. This experimental version of First Steps showcases how your Touch Controllers can be replaced with hand tracking, and add a new dimension to your application. Our development team did not have to redesign new mechanics, but were able to replace Touch Controllers with Hands without a heavy lift.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Educational, Exploration",English,1.0.920500,Oculus,Oculus,https://developer.oculus.com/blog/adding-hand-tracking-to-first-steps/,"Mar 3, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3974885535895823/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3974885535895823&r=1, https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/?utm_source=www.oculus.com&utm_medium=oculusredirect",Terms of Service,919.7 MB,Literally just First Steps with hand tracking. It’s a very cool way to get used to hand tracking on the Quest.,why am I under the table,"Just the First Steps tutorial you get when you first start up your headset, just with your hands. Nice and neat",Its very laggy and not really playable,"Obviously some parts of the experience barely work (the two minigames), but overall I was quite impressed. Throwing stuff is still not really possible with hand tracking, but this was the first time it kind of felt predictable without having to accommodate for the tracking, good job! In other games things just fly all over the place when you throw them and your hands disappear due to the tracking being lost."
