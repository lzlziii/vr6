Meaning there were parts at the beginning I didn't know if it was the story or a glitch. The first update seems like it was a glitch. I guess as an older guy I would like a tutorial or a quick guide on that wrist thingy üëç. (That's why there is a training room, silly me!) I still want to see where the story goes!",I wonder if you could add a romance option for bishop for one of the girls I'd read lots of romance one of the girls would be like in mass effects,"The story is excellent, and I am highly interested in the mystery surrounding the ship. Overall, a very well-made game in my opinion."
