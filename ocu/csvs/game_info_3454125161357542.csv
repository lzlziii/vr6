bHaptics Player,"bHaptics Player App is a device manager which allows users to connect bhaptics devices with Oculus Quest to play natively supported games. Pairing a device in the Player will register it on the device, allowing any games to automatically connect to the devices. Main functions of this application are as follows; 1. Pair / Unpair: Users can Pair and unpair bHaptics' haptic devices. Once the haptic devices are paired with the app, it does not require any other pairing processes for Quest game which used the bHaptics SDK to provide haptic feedback. 2. Real-time Streaming: Users can see the haptic mappings on bHaptics Player (PC version) realtime using this application.

I have always had the hardest time getting this to work properly with the quest 2 since day 1. I'll never understand why we have to go through a separate app to get this to pair with the headset. The old app before this could detect my suit and I can ping it, but as soon as I leave to start a game it disconnects and says there are no paired devices. This new updated app is even worse because no matter what I do, it will not detect my suit at all when it is flashing trying to pair. It won't show up under the list of available devices and I can not pair through the headset settings as well. Out of about 100 times of trying to use this with VR. It's only worked properly as intended maybe 5 times, and that's being generous. Very discouraging and upsetting. These cost a lot of money and bhaptics should make sure they have things like this worked out well in advance before having the right to sell them at the amount that they do. I hope I can get some help someday, so far support has not done much at all.","I got the tactsuit X40 from bHaptics and connected it to my quest 2 right away. Back when the bHaptics app was the original version it worked everytime, no problem. I don't know what's happened since then but I haven't been able to get the suit to function at all in game. I can (kinda) pair the vest to the quest to get a solid blue light. But I have to go into my settings and have the quest 2 ""forget"" the vest as a previously paired device. When I reconnect it, it pairs just fine but this app will not and even outright refuses to detect anything associated with the vest. Honestly, it's really disappointing because when it worked it was one of the most immersive experiences I've ever had. Please bHaptics fix this.","I can not pair my bHaptics suit The only way it will pair is through the app and when I exit out the app, it will unpair I got this suit today I was really excited to play on it please fix it.","The bHaptics vest truly takes VR gaming to an entirely whole new level of immersion that‚Äôs really out of this world. I admit when I first got it I was extremely disappointed when I couldn‚Äôt get it to work with Thrill of the Fight given that imo it‚Äôs the best game to test it‚Äôs immersion capabilities and for a day or two I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if the vest was defective but then again the fact that it worked perfectly well with the bHaptics demos and Epic Roller Coasters that quickly assured me that it definitely works. Eventually out of desperation and unwillingness to accept that the x40 is simply incompatible with TOTF as well as getting tired of waiting that I finally searched online on how to get it to work and a few days ago I finally found the answer I was looking for and who knew it‚Äôs only as simple as going to the version in the description to enable the bHaptics that allowed the game to finally recognize the new TactSuit vest, and I‚Äôm extremely thrilled (no pun intended ü§£) to finally get to use it when playing TOTF which is the main reason/game why I couldn‚Äôt resist getting the vest in the first place. Of course, I‚Äôve been using it with all the other natively supported Quest 2 games that I already have for over 2 months and it blows my mind every single time that I get to use it, because it truly brings you into the game like no other. It‚Äôs one thing to see, hear and feel the haptics from the controllers which are already impressively immersive as is, but when you add the haptic vest to that mix the immersion experience just becomes truly mind boggling and addicting at the same time. Before I often find it disheartening whenever I see the vest being supported by Stream and Rift but not the Quest especially for the games I already have which I can only imagine would make the experience so much more exhilarating than it already is, but thankfully once again out of pure luck I accidentally stumble across the AtH profiles that finally allowed me to play with those games and pretty much any game I want for that matter with the haptic vest and that was extremely exciting for me, because now there‚Äôs literally no longer any limit on which games I can use the vest for rather it‚Äôs more like which games do I really want to use it on and which ones are best not to, because let‚Äôs face it there are some games that are better played without it especially when the freedom of movement is absolutely essential to genuinely enjoy and experience the game as intended by the devs like Dance Central, Just Hoops and workout games to name a few that I wouldn‚Äôt really want to use the vest although I did try which validated my personal opinion/preference not to use it on those games. Otherwise I extremely enjoy using it with majority of the games I own especially now that I‚Äôve discovered that I can practically use it with any game I want using the AtH profiles for the games that are currently not natively supported for the Quest, so the sky is truly the limit. Thank you so much bHaptics for making these amazing haptics peripheral devices available to us which remarkably boost the VR gaming immersion out of this world and pulls us into the VR world by allowing us to really experience and feel what we previously could only see, hear and feel through the haptics from the controllers. Your product literally brought an entirely new meaning to the word immersion and wish you won‚Äôt get tired of adding more supported games for the different gaming platforms. Cheers to your continued success! üçªüéâ And a special shout out to Nickbond, Bigskunkynugz, Floh, Purplemikey, AWH and everyone who continuously share their AtH profiles through the bHaptics app for everybody to enjoy. Thank you so very much for sharing these exceptional profiles that truly enable us to truly enjoy the bHaptics vest like never before. üôèüèªü§©üíê"
