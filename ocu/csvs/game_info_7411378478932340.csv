I decided to have another go, and really glad I did! The graphics look great the game is now very polished. Within seconds I found online gameplay and had a lot of fun getting blown up by the experienced online players, and now ready for my revenge ( üòà Mwahaha ) Five stars from me - buy it! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê","I see a some people complaining about graphics, but honestly, compared to other games, it‚Äôs so much more better. The dev team did a great job of creating a great game that explains exactly what they described. Don‚Äôt let some negative ungrateful people discourage you Tank Arena! I‚Äôm sure they must have seen the trailers too before purchasing? And after seeing what the game was about, they still complain about the graphics? Sounds dubious to me. Sure the game can improve, but I still think it‚Äôs easy compared to other games and it‚Äôs super engaging and fun. If you are unsure if you like this type of game or not, go to Youtube and watch some of their videos. That‚Äôll definitely help you to know what you‚Äôre buying.","There's stuff that could use a bit of polish, but overall, it's a pretty fun game. You can get strategic with tanks, each one with its own cool abilities. I was mainly into the long-range artillery tank, and sniping from far away was a blast. The part where your tank catches fire when you get hit, and you gotta put it out with an extinguisher? It's fun. Though, getting the hang of the controls can be a bit tricky, so they could totally beef up the tutorial. A lot of peeps are saying the graphics aren't top-notch, but honestly, it doesn't bug me much when I'm playing. It's good fun all the same. You can even play with a buddy, but it's kind of a hassle 'cause it's not like Battle.net where you can just create and join a room. Still, teaming up and making strategies with friends was fun. Would totally recommend.","Honestly, I used to think 'not that good graphic it is.' But the more I play this game, the more fun I get. Just dive into enemies territory, shoot and kill them AND being chased - counter them. Those whole processes make me overexcited. (except the killed one) Not only doing solo-Multipalying is fun but also playing with friends is more fun. My company takes cover my side, Comunicate where enemy is, and Chase enemy together. It makes more fun.",I am having a great time in this game. It is something newer to me but my experiences are limited. The art style flows well with the game and the abilities of the tanks fit the cartoony style. The games in my opinion are quite faster paced and I like how you can change tanks Midgame. Overall I‚Äôll give the game 5 stars. I‚Äôve been playing it whenever I have time for a few matches and hasn‚Äôt gotten old yet. I am genuinely having a great time in game and it‚Äôs been a blast.
