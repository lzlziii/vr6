Aerodrums 3D,"This app lets you experience a drum set performance in VR. It also serves as a 3D frontend for the Aerodrums instrument, letting you see your drum kit, sticks and feet in virtual reality. When connected to Aerodrums, you will have the ability to reposition your drum kit pieces in 3D, navigate your music playlist, enable a metronome, record your performances and switch between drum kits.

It comes with reflectingdrumsticks and foot pads, a light, and a ps3 camera. I use mine along with my pc. I think they have both an android and iPhone app, but I could be wrong about that. Tracking is ok in the vr app. I wish the developers of smash drums and Drums Rock would get together with the Aerodrums maker, because adding foot pedals in those games would be awesome",Why did they trick me? I thought I can play the drums! I don’t want to keep listening to the same music over and over again! I wish they did better than this! This is driving me crazy…,"I got this expecting a drum game. It was not that. It was so disappointing, that I immediately deleted it. It puts you in front of a drum and plays the same repetitive song over and over. You can’t do anything at all expect for listening. You see blue hands with drum sticks playing the drums, but that’s all. Nothing else at all. don’t get this. EDIT: looking back, this review was stupid. Apologies. I have changed my rating to 5 stars."
