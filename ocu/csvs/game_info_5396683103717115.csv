"Please, Believe Me","Thirty years ago, Vicki Logan, found herself diagnosed with the recently-identified Lyme Disease. When she didn’t recover after taking antibiotics, one doctor stood by her side while many in the medical establishment turned against any Lyme patient who complained of symptoms after receiving standard treatment. This VR piece investigates Vicki’s tragic case and explores why the scientific community stopped believing patients. Using a variety of new technologies, including interactive mini-games and deep fakes, the experience puts users at the center of the puzzle to uncover what happened.

There's alot of good VR work here in the envrionments, characters etc, but the story is also very moving and hits hard there at the end. The game sequence inside the body was a bit hackneyed, but that's fine. Bravo, overall."
