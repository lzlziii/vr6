The game is such good so fun and I don't know how to explain such a good game cookies🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰😭😭😭😭🍰🍰🍰🍰🍰😭😭🍰😭🍰😭😭😭😭😭😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎☕️☕️☕️☕️😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎☕️☕️☕️😎😎😎😎😎",I LOVE this game it’s like bone lab but for free but I think it would be cooler to add different kinds of guns like a magnum or a ak-47 but it’s still really great the slow motion ability is really simple and you can do neat tricks with reloading because of that it’s just that I wish the enemies were slower so you could do more tricks or more time to reload but besides these this is an amazing game and I’m so excited for city and multiplayer,"This game is really good and basically all of my problems were just settings I missed.this game has a lot of fun features and the game is so addicting that when it crashes I immediately start it again but in the next update can you try and fix the problem with the buttons and welding and can you add a feature to set your height manually and one feature I think would be cool would to be able to change your skin between the red, gray, and the navy blue robots 10/10.",It’s really fun and I can’t wait for multi player to come out. Although the freeze gun unforchinitly doesn’t work on enimies and you can’t weld things to them it would be nice if you could do that but I understand that that would be hard to code depending on what your useing to make it. So good luck and I hope you all have fun and enjoy making this it’s so fun.,I absolutely love this game it’s just like bonelab but free and I have something to say I found a glitch that allows me to fly you hit a robot arm after it’s not attached with an axe and point it in that direction and then you kinda go fast and fly but after all this game is amazing 10/10
