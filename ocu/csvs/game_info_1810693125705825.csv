HOWEVER, most of the courses are locked until you find all of the icons on the first course. I’m 58 years old and I just wanna have some fun with this game with me and my granddaughter. We have spent over three hours trying to get through the first course. We have found 58 of 60 of the icons to get to the next level. There is no way we can find the last two. I didn’t get this because I wanted to be a great game player. I just want to have fun with my granddaughter and It gets very boring after hours replaying the same course looking for these icons. DON’T buy this game unless you are a serious gamer. I am not and I don’t want to be. I am thinking about getting a refund.",Times when this could have been a fun action packed adrenaline game it failed miserably. Poor graphics and slow movement make a boring repetitive lack luster nothing to look at waste of $30. Not recommended - trust me. You’d have more fun with a dishwashing game.,"Doing the same run over and over again is kind of boring, but this game still lets me skydive in VR. What a Rush. (I’ll see myself out)",It’s a good game but the controls are weird and head movement unnecessary do not buy it,Fantastic game !! /Gergo19851114/1810693125705825/?utm_source=4 just add beginning part (vvvpontoculuspontcomperappreferals)
