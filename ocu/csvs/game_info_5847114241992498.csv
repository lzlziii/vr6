I only have a question for developers, I'm trying to load mp3 files like I do on X-Fitness. I have a subfolder into a ""Music"" folder into Quest2, the game recognize the mp3 files and play them, but doesn't show the ""Add to list"" button. I have to copy the files to ""Download"" folder into Quest2 and then the game show me the ""Add to list"" option to add them into the play list, Is it a bug or is it a normal behavior?: Congratulations for your games, I don't know why reason MetaStore doesn't add them to normal store and only stay at AppLabs. Edit: Yes, I can select ""Music"" directory (out of ""Download"" directory), and see the files and play them, but when I tried to select one of them putting my finger over it, it shows me the three combat options -1, 1, +1, when I select one of them, a download bar appear on file while charges, but; when finish; it doesn't appear the ""Add to list"" button, so I can't charge it and I can't fight listen it. If I have the same mp3 files charged into ""Download"" directory I can ""Add to list"" and fighter playing it without any problem. If could be help, in your X-Fitness game I have no problem to load this exactly ""Music"" folder (stayed out of ""Download"" folder) to play these exactly MP3. Thank you on any case for your attention. Edit 2: Is there any problem with the medals or goals panel?. For example the medal ""Achieve 10.000 points into an official game"" doesn't be active although I've been achieved 196.000 points into an official game in one session/track.","My thoughts on the game: I'm in aww by the graphics and the way it feels when you punch a character but the whole rhythm game mechanics takes me out of it. Honestly just get rid of the whole rhythm thing and make this into an actual fighting game like thrill of the fight, or at least make that type of gameplay available as a separate option. (Simplicity is best, that's why thrill of the fight was so successful and it built upon real boxing and that's also why thrill of the fight is also better than creed. This has the potential to be better than both of them.) This game could be really great with the AR mode and AAA graphics and animations as well as the hit physics it would an instant HIT 100%. (The AR mode is something special that's for sure.) If you wanted something more arcade like. I would imagine you could make something similar to a Street Fighter 2 type of game except in VR and it would be spectacular. So much potential for this. But currently I only give it 3 stars. Great graphics. Nice fighting physics. Not a fan of the game mechanics. Hoping for great things for the future on this one however.",I updated my review to 5 start. Dev was very responsive to address custom songs problem. Actually it was my fault because my songs were in different directory not directly under music folder. Now it works well! This is one of the best workout VR game!,"This game is truly exceptional, particularly for fans of VR Fitness games. Firstly, kudos to the developers for crafting a mixed reality boxing experience. Incorporating mixed reality in boxing games is crucial, as it's all too easy to accidentally injure yourself with a misplaced punch. The immersive nature of this game makes it feel like a genuine fight. This is a key factor in why I haven't played many boxing games previously. Secondly, it's not as challenging or tiring as some other boxing games where you feel like you're in a life-or-death struggle. Instead, you fight to the beat, and as long as you find your rhythm, you can learn your opponents' styles and get through the workout. Knocking them out doesn't take much effort, and within minutes, you've had a solid workout, broken a sweat, and are ready for more rounds against other bots. At last, I've discovered a boxing game that I enjoy, can complete without feeling defeated, and can exercise with without feeling like I'm on the verge of fainting. This game will undoubtedly be remembered as a classic VR fitness game, and I'm eager to see what its future holds. The music is satisfactory, but I do wish they showed you how to integrate my own music into the game, and that the controls were a bit simpler. Other than that, fantastic game and outstanding work! Oh ya, it would be great if there was a feature allowing me to record my boxing sessions with the music playing in the background, as it doesn't appear to support that currently. I'd love to share my experiences on social media.","Took me a bit to realize (though other reviews alluded to this) that nothing you do has any real effect on the cyborgs. It's all just a timed experience which really detracts from my motivation to punch them and takes away from my overall enjoyment. You can just stand there and get hit (invincible) and eventually they will disappear on their own. I hope the devs will one day add a ""combat mode"" or something along those lines as visually this game is amazing, the cyborg moves are varied and very fun to block and dodge (despite having no motivation to do so) and I love that I can add my own music. Just won't be playing very much until they've added a combat mode."
