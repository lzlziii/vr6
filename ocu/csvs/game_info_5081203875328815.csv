The people that write these reviews are friends of the creator of Robo Run and the creator of that game is a Pedophile. If you see these reviews make sure you mark it unhelpful so it gets pushed down. This game is not a 5 Star but definitely 4.7 I would consider downloading it! All the mods here keep the game safe and they are also friendly! Just make sure you also join the discord! -MarkZeroYT,"Even though i haven't played in a while, i remember this game being fun however some game modes do last a while due to people hiding but once those are over its fine. This is a very fun game and it's basically just vr fall guys with cats which makes it fun. 10/10 game would play again. (It's also good for weight loss because if you want to win you have to sweat really badly lol) -Noah O_O",But I can't join the discord,Best game,"Here are some ideas for a Cat Mania VR game: 1. Cat Cafe: Create a virtual reality cat cafe where players can interact with cats in a cozy cafe setting. They can play with the cats, feed them, and even adopt one to take home! 2. Cat Show: Host a virtual cat show where players can enter their own cats or watch other players' cats compete in various categories such as cuteness, agility, and obedience. 3. Cat Adventure: Create a virtual world where players can explore and complete challenges with their cats. They can climb trees, chase mice, and even navigate through an obstacle course. 4. Cat Training: Create a virtual reality cat training simulation where players can teach their cats new tricks such as jumping, rolling over, and playing fetch. 5. Cat Rescue: Create a virtual reality game where players are tasked with rescuing cats from dangerous situations such as being stuck in trees or trapped in a building. Players must use their skills to safely rescue the cats and bring them to safety. I hope these ideas are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with."
