I have only played a couple times so far, but I can see this quickly getting more of my gaming time. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes this genre of games. Not only is it enjoyable but it has the added benefit of a work out type of effort. Great job to the development team.","If your in to rhythm games it‚Äôs actually quite good, I like the fact you can change from gloves to sabers and guns. Makes the game feel a little different. Can get a bit of a sweat on if you go at it like. Overall good game something I‚Äôll carry on playing",Really enjoyed the game but with the addition of custom songs it is even better. Highly recommend üëç
