Straight from the start it doesnt really tell you what to do. Picking things up i found very it and miss either doesnt pick somethign up or you do and then it drops. Took me a few mins to realise to start the game you need to eat the mushroom. Once in the game you are put in the middle of a bar with a small tutorial on how to make the first drink. As i had so many issues picking things up i found this very annoying. I kept picking up glassed and they just smashed it took a while to get used to how the physics worked. After doing the first round of puring drinks you have a little mini game which a nice way to get upgrades. you can then pay for a new recipee. This is where i got totally confused, the instructions didnt make sense about adding liquid to the mushroom and as i couldnt really pick it up took a while ti figure out what i had to do. After a while i got it but its just to buggy for my liking when you have to be quick with these types of games."
