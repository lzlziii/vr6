Masternoid,"Masternoid is a pure arcade brick breaker, reimagined for the age of VR. Immerse yourself in a bright and colourful world and embrace the meditative power of coordinated voxel explosions. Followed by the sounds of an original soundtrack that adapts to gameplay and will keep you in your flow zone. Master the art of destruction, in a place where your trusted energy wave blaster from the future is your only friend. Use it to telekinetically juggle multiple ultrasonic balls with great finesse and precision. Blast your way through 50 handcrafted levels of voxel goodness, and ascend to the top of the leaderboards like a true arcade legend. Play seated or standing, as minimal physical effort and space is expected. Just a single controller is required to play, right or left is up to you.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Casual",English,1.2,Pixel Magnet,Pixel Magnet,https://masternoid.com/,"Apr 20, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5975447642528271/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5975447642528271&r=1, https://www.masternoid.com/privacy-policy-meta",280.5 MB,"I played the Demo for a while, and just purchased the Full Version. It's a lot of fun, and is relaxing, with lots of features that I'm still learning about. The music is spot-on for the game. Thanks for offering this game, I enjoy it loads.","Masternoid recreates the retro arcade feel convincingly, to the point where it feels more like a futuristic 80's game than it does a retro VR game. First off, the music is sublime. The game is easy to pick up, and level progression is good. There is some depth with the multi-ball and multiplier mechanics, which isn't too hard to figure out. There is even room for strategy if you're going for high scores. Systematically clearing a level is a form of therapy. You can just zone out and think about stuff while your reflexes take care of the balls. This is currently my favourite place to escape to. To the developers: thanks for an amazing game! Also, $@#! you and your final level ^_^","Easy to grasp, hard to master. If you are a highscore achiever this game is for you. I lost track of time quite a few times by trying to achieve a better highscore, until my Quest's battery gave up on me, forcing me to a break. Controls of the game are easy to grasp, you may need a few runs to understand how everything works (what gives you better multiplier, what the powers ups do etc) and after that the fun starts. Graphics are quite nice and very suitable for this VR take on the classic. Special mention to the soundtrack is in order, having to handle 3 balls at the same time while listening to the music really gets you pumped up. Everyone who likes VR arcade games should definitely check it out.","I'm a sucker for breakout/Arkanoid games and this is fantastic!! There are some other breakout style games on the Oculus and none has really claimed to be the must-have VR breakout game, but Masternoid could finally be the game to claim the crown. Hopefully more levels and more weapons will be introduced. Perhaps even the ability to play your own music (which adds replay-ability to all games - I'm still playing Racket NX 2 years later because of this added function!!!) Great game!! **An Endless Mode, where you only have 3 lives/balls, the levels keep coming until you lose all the balls (which get faster as you progress!!), would be great!!** **Having played through all the levels, I have to say this is an absolute joy to play. Once you know how to score the best points, you really start climbing the leaderboards for each level. There's so much potential here for extra content!! The icing on the cake would be a level editor where you can create and then share your creations!! One thing I would say, is that last level, while it made me smile due to its difficulty compared to the other levels, I hope if the developers make more levels, that they don't make too many similar to that last level. While it was a nice change, if there's too many of those levels, the game might turn from a joy to play to frustrating to play!! 11 out of 10!!!","Masternoid is a simple but addictive brick-breaker VR game, similar to classics like Arkanoid and Breakout. The old-school gameplay, synth music and retro graphics work very well together in creating an experience that can be both tense and relaxing. Highly recommended!"
