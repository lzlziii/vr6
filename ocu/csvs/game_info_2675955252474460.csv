Now there is no multi-player at all, especially after the last server update which caused a lot of sound problems and crashes to desktop. Don't get me wrong. I would rather play a good table top game over just about anything else available, but people move on to other games. You can wait and wait for a game now and there will be no one available. Buy it for the AI gameplay. Coming up with a good deck to always beat the AI became my objective. It took many games for me to consistently win at the highest levels and I found it to be a memorable experience.",Once I got this game I got so excited but when I started playing the game I couldn’t connect with players and I had enough sky coins for a skin not knowing I couldn’t buy it. Please can I get a refund!,"I really really enjoy this game, ans always enjoyed this kind of games so I might be a bit biased. The graphics and mechanics are great imo, you can upgrade and buy new units and spells. Sadly it's always hard to find a online battle for me, wish it was a bit more active as it's one of a kind for me.","My favorite style of game and happy to see it on the oculus, has potential to be a popular pvp game. Fix the flyers having all the advantages, why make a map that has lava damaging my ground units?, and worst of all there are not enough players to find a match. I just play against the AI and farm out gold but hopefully this game gets some advertising.",Those who play with the left hand are not recommended to download the game. A game that doesn't even allow people who play left-handed should delete itself from the list of games!! The game only lets you play against the computer. Sorry I bought this game!
