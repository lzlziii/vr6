I do really like the game a lot too. I've played it up to about level 6 or 7 songs where it became too hard to keep up. The only thing is it feels like it lacks a bit of polish. There are only a few types of notes and while some songs are charted really well, others it felt kind of random. Still, I really enjoyed it and I plan on playing more as time goes on so I should get better. Plus, there are songs by T-pazolite so how can you go wrong?"
