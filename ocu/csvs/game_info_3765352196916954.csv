Into Space,"In 2 intriguing Virtual Reality films, viewers set off for fascinating VR expeditions into space. They explore unknown worlds by visiting settings of extraordinary richness of detail and authenticity - perfectly reconstructed in 3D on basis of original data from NASA and ESA – that convey a realistic sensation of how it must feel to actually be out in the open cosmos. 1st Step tells the magical story of the Apollo missions - from the rocket launch up to their return on earth. For the first time, viewers experience this thrilling adventure in a completely new way in VR as they get the chance to perceive the extreme dimensions of the missions in an unprecedented spatial quality through the eyes of the astronauts, e.g. the unbelievable narrowness of the command capsule, but also the surprising topography of the lunar landscape. With “2nd Step"", they take a step further by joining space pilots on a future mission to prospective destinations on the Moon and Mars.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", 360 Experience (non-game), Movie, Space/Universe",English,0.904,FaberCourtial,Faber Courtial,https://faber-courtial.de/,"Jun 16, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3765352196916954/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3765352196916954&r=1, https://faber-courtial.de/impressum/",127.4 MB,"Its not possible to download the videos. After reinstalling and several tries, I could download the first one, but not the second one. The streaming quality is very bad.","It's a 3D-360 video, not a 6DOF app, so motion sickness is possible. Also the subtitles are sometimes in wrong depth level, cannot fuse with my eyes. I cannot disable subtitles. No menu. OR? Please make sure, because my english is fine, voiceover is slow, easy to understand no need for subtitles. And for people with no english language, a translation would be very nice. For example i'm in Hungary, and like to show this app to people with hungarian subtitles. Please make it possible, i can help you in translating!","The graphics on this are great, using real 3D data from NASA to map the moon for example. It's all high quality. It's in full 360 degrees. A few of the smoke effects are poor, but otherwise good. They use real actors, so the astronauts also look great and move realistically. Like most movies on the Quest, it's short, 30-45 minutes. I found the camera angle to be a poor choice sometimes, so that you had to tilt your head to see the main object in the scene off to the side instead of it going in front of you. Overall a pleasant experience and I hope to see more like this, and I hope the developer considers the camera angles more for future projects."
