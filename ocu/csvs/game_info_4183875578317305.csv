Ajax All Powerful,"Ajax (Henry Winkler) is a foul-mouthed, double-crossing genie addicted to the human souls he collects in exchange for granting wishes to gullible humans. However, something is different about the seemingly-naive little girl who has rubbed his lamp this time. For one thing, she’s hired a strait-laced lawyer (Chris Parnell) to negotiate her wishes, and they might have a trick or two buried in the new contract’s legalese…. Written and directed by award-winning VR creator Ethan Shaftel (KAIJU CONFIDENTIAL, EXTRAVAGANZA), AJAX ALL POWERFUL is an innovative VR comedy utilizing behind-the-scenes interactive triggers to create a fluid world of changing sizes and perspectives as the story progresses from the lamp to the real world, and beyond, ",7+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Entertainment,", Comedy, Movies",English,1.13,easyAction,VeeR,http://AjaxAllPowerful.com/,"Jun 24, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4183875578317305/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4183875578317305&r=1, http://o8dy6wafc.bkt.clouddn.com/VeeR-PrivacyPolicy.pdf",582.7 MB,This is a 20+ minute CG film with wit and attitude.,"I loved this, it was funny, well animated and the sound was nicely done too with a really suitable voice cast for the characters. When you watch it treat it more like a short to medium length comedy sketch as it's only a few minutes long and your expectations will be in proportion but don't let the length put you off because there's some great dialogue and gags. I'm deducting one star because you have to sit quite still when you watch it, despite you actually being in the scene you can't change your viewpoint very much or move around or the animation stops, everything goes black and you get a message saying that you're outside the playspace, this could almost be a 3DoF app for the GearVR or Go. I would love to be able to have moved around a little bit and it would have added to the rewatchability too. Regardless off that one issue, which is by no means a deal breaker, I really enjoyed this story, the action is pretty much contained in a 180 degree field of view despite the environment being 360, so you can sit down and don't have to keep turning to see what's going on. I'd love to see more of this story, what happens next etc, if it was double the length then I think it would be worth a spending few bucks for.","When they are reviewing the contract, the following is displayed on the projector screen shortly after Ajax talks about closing the loophole: ""3. NEGITAVE OUTCOME - A scenario resultant from a Wish that is considered unfavorable by Izzie."" That's a pretty bad mistake to leave in there, it should be ""NEGATIVE"", which I'm sure you know as it is spelt correctly elsewhere on the contract! Aside from that, I thought it was an interesting story, and thanks for making it proper 3D VR, instead of the 2D 360 videos that most people put out.",I was expecting something boring. Turn out to be quite funny and well done. Thanks for making it.,I wasn’t a big fan of this short. The idea of being inside the genie lamp was cool but other than that This is just a CG short with some foul language. It had much more potential
