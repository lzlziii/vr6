Crumbling Demo,Whoosh! Bam! Pow! Remember playing with action figures? Unwrap your Crumbling from its blister package and take its fate into your hand - literally. Crumbling is a VR rogue-like action adventure where you control your character as if it was an action figure in your hand. Move it around meticulously hand-crafted dioramas using your touch controller. Or use the native hand-tracking of the Oculus Quest. Fight against an onslaught of plastic monsters in hack'n'slash combat that is all about timing. Discover the story of the endearing Mr. and Mrs. Crumble through animated and narrated comic books. Learn how the evil Böse Corp. stole all their magic in order to make their horrible monster toys come alive. Are you ready to wield your Crumbling against the evil minions of Böse Corp. and reclaim the magic?,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Fighting",English,0.11.1_demo,Crumbling Games,Crumbling Games,https://crumbling-game.com/,"May 12, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4150531058291612/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4150531058291612&r=1, https://crumbling-game.com/privacy-policy/",1.49 GB,Amazing graphics and just over all great stuff so far,"This game was amazing the way you get to play with the action figure like a little kid again swinging it around was so fun sad to see that it was only a demo of the full thing, can’t wait to see the finished product the joy it brought me was amazing Is there a rough date like spring summer or fall of next year your hoping to release it Is there a price you had in mind for the full game Is there any chance this down the road would become a game that you could play with a friend as in like 2 hero’s fighting together And are you planning dlc for it in the future",I've had this for a while now hoping some sort of updates would come or the full game would drop You guys drop a full game and your in business i really hope you haven't given up on this game,"First, wanted to say I was disappointed that this was a demo. I was really starting to enjoy the game and then it ended. But the gameplay so far looked like something Oculus would really want on their front page. The Graphics, Story, and Gameplay were all so charming and magical. One thing I would say was a problem was that I couldn't switch the Character from one hand to the other, which was kind of a problem. But I hope to see the full game release soon with some very interesting features I haven't seen yet. Good luck, I'll be back.",I hope in the full version of the game it’s free and more action figures other then that fun game
