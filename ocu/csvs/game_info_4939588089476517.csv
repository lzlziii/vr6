The story was quite interesting too, though I'll admit I didn't follow it very well. The only real problem I have with it is that there aren't any checkpoints while your in the air, so if you mess up the landing you have to restart the entire mission.","Can you make the grip on levers WAY less slippery? When I have to pull the landing gear lever 10x until it locks into place, and I say to myself ""what a horrible world"". Fix this yesterday please. I wanna grab something and hold onto it like a DJ's fingers on a turn table if necessary. Am I supposed to play standing up? Fix this please, fix it!",Level 13 can't load correctly.,So I bought this game 2 weeks ago and since then I’ve been playing making the most of my experience and played around in the game modes and everything there’s not 1 single thing that’s ruined my experience I recommend this game for people who like the sound of a fully interactive cockpit and flying controlling the plane is easy and my overall rating 10/10,It tells you to do all these things in the cockpit and it is a good general idea but it is just impossible to control the plane It practically has a mind of its own when trying to hold the throttle with one hand. I bought the game for fun not stress
