Symphony of Stars,"Play Symphony of Stars how you like! Fly around gazing at the stars and planets, or engage in combat, take over planets and build your faction's empire! If you choose the later, you'll need to use a bit of strategy as there are other factions vying for control of the system in the game. Build up resources, and properly leave planets defended before moving on the attack. Features: -3 Different playable factions, each with their own style of ship -Randomly generated maps, each game is different! -AI Difficulty levels, and team settings. Up the AI difficulty and try to take them down with a friend if you'd like! -Online multiplayer, play with up to 9 other humans or hone your skills against the AI!",7+,"Multiplayer, Single User","Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Flying, Simulation",English,1.93,Only Human Studios,Only Human Studios,https://www.onlyhumanstudios.net/,"May 25, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5334552513281829/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5334552513281829&r=1, https://www.onlyhumanstudios.net/privacy-policy",1.97 GB,"Tutorial is broken, but you don't need it! Kill the bad guys, shoot the planet until population reaches zero, colonize planet, spawn defenders, move on to the next one. It's a simple loop and with a pop 1000 planet you'll be sitting there shooting it longer than seems reasonable, but it is a great little game. Dogfights are a lot of fun. Virtual HOTAS works very well. There are fighters, colony ships, and capital ships. There are 3 races to choose from, each with a different set of ships (with different weapons.) The weapons are balanced well as the hitscan beam is significantly slower to kill than the slower projectiles. This is probably my favorite space game on Quest just for the fact that it lets me free fly around a solar system. The graphics aren't great, but they have their own charm. It can be a lot of fun for the right person!"
