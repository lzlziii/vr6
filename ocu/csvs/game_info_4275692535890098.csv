I've tried the demo and loved it. Bought it and got adicted. The expert hand tracking mode is lame. Doesn't work well... But it deserves 5 starts because of the rest. The controllers mode is really realistic, simulating perfectly basketball movements. You feel exactly like playing in arcades machine. The challenge is fair and you really exercise. I love it and worth each penny.","I played the demo and it is interesting. In the beginning they tell you to put ball into basket in front of you so it's quite confusing what to do, because you need to put it many times :) But after moment I was able to play it correctly. On next levels the basket is further away from you. I was using both controllers to throw the ball then I realized I can use just one. I read that hand tracking is supported but not trying it yet. It is fun to throw the ball but problem is that after few times you succeed each time, there is no variability. I wonder what is in the full game, will the basket move or something. Would need to watch some video before puchasing full.",I have only played the demo so far and it was the first game I played on the Oculus but it is truly amazing! I love the basketball arcade hoops it re-represents and its super fun shooting at different lengths and heights. Definitely will buy full game!! :),"The very first level was a bit confusing as the machine was to my left and the hoop to my right, I was expecting a hoop in front of me and was unsure if I had to recenter. The second level where the hoop is Infront of you would be a better first level in my opinion as you can see the hoop straight away and only have to drop the ball in. The control's take a minute to get used but work well once you get the hang of it. I didn't realise it used hand tracking so I will be testing that out later and will probably come back to update on that. Graphics are nice and well done but once I found the pass through switch, I don't think I'll ever turn it back off. I felt way more comfortable being able to see my surroundings because I have low ceilings and I am 6ft 3 which is not ideal for shooting hoopsðŸ˜‚ My arms also started to ache a bit as they got a decent workout, I spend a good bit of time trying to set some high scores, then try to beat them and it became quite fun even on the basic levels. Overall I think it was a great experience and I look forward to playing the full game soon","I purchased the full version because the demo was what I was looking for. The game itself is great when you can actually get to it. The interface routine is terrible. You make all of your selections via an old time arcade game. You have 2 hands visible at all times, and you point your fingers to select buttons on the arcade game. But you also seem to be able to control the selections with hand motions, which, when you grab the trigger to point your finger sends another signal to the machine that does something wholly different. It also seems as though you can't go directly to any pop a shot level you want. Each time, you have to start at the beginning shooting baskets from one foot away and then get progressively further until you get the fill length shooting game. Why can't I go there directly? If there is a way (which there should be) it is very poorly communicated. Walkabout Golf has a very simple user friendly front end that puts this to shame. Many other games have the ability to make your selections via a laser beam a on a billboard and it's easy. I'm not going to return this game because I think it will be great once I figure their system out. Until then, I'll continue to cuss and swear about the design work. It also gives you no room to stand where you want. You put the headset on, and wherever the arcade game appears, you'd better be exactly where you want to be in your room because there's no way to alter your position."
