I finished all assessments and it would not unlock the last four rifles. The gambling RNG is very bad and I suspect the developer coded the game so the player loses more often than not. I tracked the gambling game, which cards were dealt to me and the dealer. I also tracked the number of face cards and frequency which they appeared, and statistically there is no way that they dealer could be winning so many times with out the help of some pre programmed algorithm. So one star if it gets fixed, if there is going to ever be another update. I am updating the review to three stars, because the dev did respond. I did unlock the new guns by starting a new game plus. I have experience playing black jack, so I know how to play the game. It just seems to me that Face cards are drawn more often than not. There will be times that the dealer just so coincidently, gets face cards and beats my by one or two. I quite playing the simplejack. I really like the game, I just do not think the RNG is be randomized enough for the black jack game.","I love this game, I have actually done shoothouse runs, and this is good. If you make another one, let me know! I reset everyday and run through it all over again. I do recommend this game.","An incredibly good game for a more than fair price. It is very well made, the graphics are good, the sound is really good! The weapon selection and handling are excellent, the levels with assessments and challenges are fun, and you always enjoy going back to play again. In my opinion, the trailer doesn't show how good the game really is. And as if that wasn't enough, the game gets an update with ""Beyond the Booth"" that I never expected. I thought there would be a few more levels added, and I would have been totally happy with that alone. But the update is a real surprise, and what's hidden behind it is gigantic. It's like another, new game, with a full campaign. First it gives a look into the back office area of the shooting range and starts with a few puzzle elements that could have come from a room escape game. After that, it surprisingly turns into a great science fiction shooter. The whole mood is suddenly changed. Where is this shooting range? Are we part of an experiment? Where are we? So brilliant! Honestly, the update alone could be a completely separate game, and I would pay for it anytime! The atmosphere, the sound, the design - great. The game deserves 5 stars.","Pro: -Realistic weapons and handling. -Flicker-free sharp graphics -Many stages -A Paintball Airsoft Pistol :-D Cons: -Weapons could shine a little more - Gunshot noise a bit too low -The life bar above the target is out of place and interferes with the immersion of a target range. After a headshot, the targets should disappear directly into the ground and not only the bar should turn red and the target should disappear 3 seconds later. That kind of slows the whole thing down. In Gunclub shooting is more fun because only one or 2 targets can be seen at the same time, and not 10 or more in one room, as is sometimes the case here. In short, dead targets should disappear faster and it would be more fun if targets gradually rise like in gunclub. Still a nice change for a good price for fans of Gunclub vr.","shotwood is a great game but i only have one big issue, the thing is i shoot left handed and i move with the left joystick but you guys set the default to left handed mode to moving with the right joystick, if you guys add a seperate setting to switch the movement options around for comfort it would be great. i love your game and this is the only gamebreaking issue to me"
