As you leave your cabin with the help of some uncanny sidekicks, you realize what's waiting outside is not at all what you expected… • Break multiple laws of physics in mind-bending puzzles! • Climb the lighthouse before The Big Storm, with the help of uncanny sidekicks • Toy around with your model lighthouse, inside a lighthouse, inside a... is that another lighthouse? • Uncover the truth behind an unusually tall fisherman's tale Brought to you by Vertigo Games, A Fisherman's Tale is developed by Innerspace, co-produced with ARTE France supported by CNC, Ville de Paris & BPI France.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Interactive Story, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Venezuela)",1.064,InnerspaceVR,Vertigo Games,http://afishermanstale-game.com/,"Nov 27, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2299967930057156/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2299967930057156&r=1, https://vertigo-games.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,2.28 GB,"Yes, the story is very short, comparable to the fabulous Moss Adventures, but the game is fun and has some fun puzzles. It is easier to complete than other games if your hand mobility is limited. A big reason for all the negative comments would be the price and so I would recommend you either wait for a sale or use a coupon code like this.... GET 25 PCT OFF, JUST GOOGLE (no spaces) t r . e e (forward slash) H A R t Y V D 8 i g","I played this game and if I hadn’t of looked up on YouTube how to complete it, I would’ve never figured it out. Once it’s figured out, and played again, it can be completed in a very short period of time, so I have no desire to play it again. Cute game, but not very challenging.","Man, I thought this would be way better. Everyone in my oculus group kept saying how amazing this game is, but honestly, it's just ok. The storyline is cute, but the game is very short for the price. I finished it in less than 2 hours. I was expecting a lot more. The last scene ugh. Y'all need to allow us to save btwn chapters.","One of the most unique, imaginative and even psychologically deep (very rare) VR games out there. Great storytelling within the virtual medium, too. Can't wait to play the sequel...","A very well made game with a great story and wonderful style! The puzzles are clever, if a little simple. The big downside is that the game is very short. I beat it in only 90 minutes... And that's without rushing. I was taking my time. Slightly disappointing, but only because I was enjoying it so much. I wanted more, especially for $30."
