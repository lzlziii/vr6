JETBOUNCE,"CONTENT UPDATE: - Lunatic Mode - Map 2: The Demon's Escape JETBOUNCE is a platformer and exploration game where you collect items to unlock new levels, unlock abilities, and power-ups. A Collect-A-Thon where you fly, jump and bounce in non-linear levels. Which engine will you choose? -Power Mode: ludicrous speed but hard to control. For an exciting experience. -Flow Mode: slower but smoother, easy to control. For a more relaxing experience. For the fans of old-school platformers from the N64 era. FLY, JUMP, BOUNCE Pull the triger to fly, release it to get launched where you're aiming. Bounce and use your momentum to fly high like a rocket! ...or fall like a heavy cauldron. Speed and momentum are a double-edged sword. The faster you go the longer your jumps, but the harder it is to control. All levels are handcrafted to reward exploration and mastery. JETBOUNCE is hard and you can get stuck. But don't give up, you will reach the top.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Adventure, Exploration, Flying",English,1.4.0,Kastel Software,Kastel Software,https://www.facebook.com/kastelsoft,"Jan 19, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3953214128113455/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3953214128113455&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wv8p_ZmThhlgjrFFQX-9JzDVbA1FcMdDUYqefYzExHs/edit#heading=h.ya1fbk20g670",818.7 MB,"TL;DR: the right amount of frustration at first, a ton of fun to speedrun once you figure it out The first time I played this game I really struggled with the controls. It felt awkward, I was constantly battling the controls, struggling just to stand in one place and couldn't gain any height at all. However, I was still able to make steady progress, and even if it was pretty slow, at no point did I feel completely stuck. Was it frustrating? A bit, but never too much. I enjoyed the balance and making progress always felt rewarding. During the second playthrough, when I got used to the controls, it felt like a completely different game. Once you figure out the controls, the levels completely open up, and you can choose between countless routes to fly through them. This makes the game a ton of fun to speedrun, and I ended up finishing the game dozens of times. The visuals are the weakest part of the game. Still, the game plays amazingly well and is 100% worth it if you are into harder platformers. A solid 9/10, can't wait for more levels!","What a great game , its proves graphics don't mean anything when it comes to gameplay , I spent hours trying to perfect my bounce skills and had an absolute blast So if you want a game to have fun in get this Martin76x","I've been playtesting this game since the alpha, and i love the game.

Easy to get to grips with but difficult to master. You can check it out in my top 10 best app lab games list: https://youtu.be/8ZG7KHOOan8",So far I’m enjoying Jetbounce. Physics-based platformer where you have to control bouncing yourself through various worlds to collect items. I’ve had no issue with motion sickness but I guess your mileage may vary. Highly recommend checking it out if you like a casual physics-based game with challenging levels. And the developers are very helpful and responsive on their Discord server which is a nice bonus. Keep on bouncing! :)
