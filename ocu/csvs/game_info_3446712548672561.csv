This game is my favorite game currently and this game is decently long but I enjoyed every part of this game.

Prison Boss VR offers a unique and engaging take on the simulation genre, immersing players into the gritty world of prison life. As a virtual inmate, you'll be tasked with crafting and trading items to survive and thrive behind bars. The game's captivating mechanics, such as crafting contraband in your cell and interacting with fellow inmates, create a sense of immersion and strategy that's both challenging and rewarding. The minimalist and cartoonish art style gives the game a lighthearted feel, which contrasts intriguingly with the prison setting. The freedom to customize and decorate your cell adds a personal touch to the experience, allowing you to truly make it your own.

If you're looking for a novel and immersive VR experience that offers a taste of prison life without the real-life consequences, Prison Boss VR is definitely worth a look.",If you're having problems like I did at first here are a few tips gods guards cannot see contraband if it's behind something if something is behind for example a bin the guard won't be able to see it the second tip if you are having problems with you going out of bound try calibrating it in the settings or try to switch to room guardian or stationary if your already in room tip number 3 always have a backup plan for example if you can make alcohol always have enough resources to make more for example if you only need three for a quest it gets enough resources to make five that five if you get caught you still have two two get money back tip number four always make the highest priced item for example alcohol or cake when you get a chance but overall 10 out of 10 game I love it,"Honesly I enjoy the game and would 100 percent recommend. You have a lot of gameplay and can spend many hours in this game without realizing. Overall, great game with good graphics and I don‚Äôt have any criticisms about this game and definitely money well spent. If you are thinking to buy this game I got you. Send me a message saying the game name and 25 percent link. And I‚Äôll message you the link to give you a nice 25 percent off the game!!! üòä"
