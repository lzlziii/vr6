Curling,"Play the sport of curling. After you slide across the ice to release the stone, hand your friend a touch controller and get them to ""SWEEP!"". Curling is fundamentally a social game. So is this VR game! The social aspect is similar to ""Keep Talking & Nobody Explodes"". Everyone needs to be in the same room. Sweepers for your team don't use the HMD, they use only the Touch controllers. Opposing teams play hot-seat style. Handing off a single Quest HMD to a member on the other team. Computer controlled AI curlers are not yet implemented.
