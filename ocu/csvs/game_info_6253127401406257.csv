WONT RECOMMEND UNTIL THE BUGS ARE FIXED!!!!,"This game was looking good, I loved the fact that finally there was going to be a forklift sim but no button allowed me to be strapped to the forklift, I had to drive a little then stop and walk forward and repeat, I had no other problems but I enjoyable because of this one issue.","It's a shame, the simulation looks amazing (the movement is poor and some movement lag is never good to avoid motion sickness) but I couldn't enjoy the experience... why? BECAUSE I NEVER MANAGED TO GET IN THE VEHICLE! Really, no tutorial, no simple solution, no easy or logical IX, well it was easier to climb on top of the bobcat and still nothing worked.",All I could do was turn it on and use the controls but nothing else. My size could not be changed. Teleporting was buggy,"The game might or might not be fine, I cannot really evaluate as the joystick sensitivity is just way too high. I can recommend raising the time required to a joystick turn to be registered as currently by default settings I'm unable to control the game at all as I can't turn. This isn't really a problem in any other game, like I've had a few ghost input, but in this game every right turn cause a left right after it. After fiddling with controller calibration it can be reduced quite a bit, but it's still present and annoying, and it is caused by a too naive way of handling imput, as no other app or game have this problem."
