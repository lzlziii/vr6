Operation Warcade,"Operation warcade is a shooter specifically designed for virtual reality, inspired by the late '80s classic war arcade that now uses the latest technology to convert it into a unique experience. EXPERIENCE THE EMOTION FROM WITHIN Thanks to the innovative immersion system, you will be able to travel inside the video game whenever you want to experience the adventure in a completely different way, like shooting from a helicopter, from a trench or from inside a tankâ€¦ because why not? The power is on your side. NEW RULES, USE THE ENVIRONMENT! Use all the elements in the environment in your favor with the incredible gravity gun. You will be able to capture any object in the landscape and launch it against enemies, converting them into a weapon.

Now it has been updated to ad the VR experience! You start the game like you're playing an old-fashioned coin-op game, standing at the game front, and then while you're playing you can suddenly be brought INSIDE the game and playing it in the first person as you try to finish your operation. I found this in/out of VR confusing at first but the more I played the game the more I liked the idea and the gameplay. I dropped the rating recently because after a year there is still too many glitches in the game. I shot the arcade screen to start the next round when I found myself standing several feet to the left of the machine and the game was running. Part of the time everything was messed up and you couldn't distinguish anything on the screen and part of the time it was perfectly clear. I had to get out of the game and restart it to fix the problem. It seems like nothing has changed or was added/fixed in over a year. What a shame, this game had real potential.","This game was a lot more fun than I thought it was going to be... Lots of levels, different guns and bows.","If youâ€™re an old school arcade player, this game is for you.","You are awesome ðŸ˜Ž, very good game. Iâ€™m dev too, Iâ€™m gonna tell you what was my experience: when Iâ€™m playing in 3 times show me the guardian set up. Sometimes the game was slowly. It will be nice if when introduce the mini games, show the instruction how to play. I have my own game Dangerous Fists, if you want to play it will be cool.","I have the Steam version of this game and it plays very smoothly with Virtual Desktop. I saw that the Quest-native version was on sale and figured I'd snag it to save me a little time when I want to play it. Sadly, it is a BIG step down in graphical quality. There is far less in terms of environmental elements on the screen, the colors are washed out and dull, and the texture maps for everything (vehicles, trees, soldiers, etc.) are incredibly bland in comparison to the Steam version. Graphically, it's on par with a low end Nintendo 64 game. I hope that the developers are still optimizing this game, and if they can get it close to the quality of the Steam version, I'd give this game 5 stars without hesitation, as the gameplay itself is still a lot of fun."
