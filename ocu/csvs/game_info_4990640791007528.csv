What numbers its?? I dont undertand?!!,Thank you so much for the experience,"I did this as a remote work team building exercise, and it's great! Don't mind the 1-star review, they didn't understand that this is a scheduled experience, with a live host. Book a time at their website and then log into the app at the appropriate time and enter your code. It's far more than a lobby! Pro-tip: be very nice to the host for extra rewards and fun.","This show was amazing. The ability to interact with a live actor rather than a NPC adds so much to the experience. You can cheer on your team, insult the villain, and solve puzzles as a group. I see other reviews complaining that the experience is $75, but it’s not. It’s $75 for a group of EIGHT which is only 9 bucks per person! The experience was AMAZING and honestly should be more expensive based on the quality of the performance.","A waste of space, especially since you cannot permanently remove an app's icon from the quest. It's only a lobby with a $75 a game price tag. Quite a cash grab."
