Bridge engineer seemed like a decent game when I first saw it, but after playing a few levels I'm hooked. Firstly, the building feels really good, although it was a bit confusing at first, the system for picking what parts u pick is great and the way they connect is equally just as well implemented. Something about placing the parts down with your hand just lets you have a lot more precision and also feels more engaging. Testing the bridges you make is also great. Depending on the difficulty level you drive different vehicles across the bridge, and they all feel great to drive, and depending on whether or not you drive from the first or third person view it can be kinda scary, as there's usually a steep cliff that your bridge is protecting you from depending on how well you built it. Overall the game is super fun and there are many different bridge parts for you to play around with. The only problem I had while playing is when selecting parts from the build menu it sometimes selects the wrong thing (this next one is more of a nitpick but the cars don't have functioning mirrors), but other than that the game is perfect. 10/10 TBH"
