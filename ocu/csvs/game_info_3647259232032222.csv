We had so much fun! If you ever played that game you’re riding in a sidecar on a German motorcycle during World War II. Now you get to actually ride in the sidecar in virtual reality. Amazing brings back a lot of memories. Thank you for bringing the game back in VR! The game is a lot of fun an has a good story line in my opinion.",People keep saying bad things abt this game and they are not really smart. This game is really good and it might be hard at first but if u play it long enough you’ll get it. As a ww2 nerd it really captures the experience. Don’t listen to the negative reviews those ppl just got problems. 5/5 game worth it,"When I first purchased this game, I did the training and I loved it. Then I did the first mission, lost horribly, and quit for about 2 months. When I came back to it, I didn’t quit and just kept training repeatedly before I entered the missions campaign and I love it. Good story, good physics, the graphics are a little better then N64, I’d say they’re like Game Cube “The Big Red One” graphics. Lol! Still great. And as the Quest 2 (v55) keeps getting better, so will this gameplay. A couple tips for starters: 1) actually ducking/kneeling for dodging bullets or taking cover is a must, which I didn’t know when I first got the game and is why I kept LOSING lol. 2) there’s a “live game training” in the weapons door next to the “start campaign” door that you should run through first. A couple times. Til you get a handle of the warfare 3) once you get the mechanics and whatnot, it’s worth the size and the money. Hope this review helped!","I love medal of honor, and it is one of my favorites to this day, and this VR medal of honor was almost perfect except how big the game is in storage, most vr games usually go around 4-6 gigabytes and some even 10 gigabytes but this game needs a whopping 40 GIGABYTES that is a lot of gigabytes for how little storage is on quest but I do have to admit the story is pretty long graphics are good and you will have a game that can last you a few weeks but you can barley keep this installed with how big it is","Baffles me why this game hasn't got a higher rating than it does. Weapons are 100% history replicas. Game difficulty is slowly increased with each scenario giving you lots of time to master the best weapon and mission. Maybe it's the difficulty levels themselves. Lowest level difficulty is not a walk in the park, so have patience and enjoy the story as you shoot some Nazi, lol."
