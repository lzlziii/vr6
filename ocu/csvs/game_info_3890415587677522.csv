The steering degree should have a setting from the normal amount to 900 degrees to make the driving feel more realistic, another settings I would like to go over is sliding on the steering wheel, yes another feature in the settings for the option for your hand to slide on the steering wheel. Other than that the game is still good and if suggestions I just mentioned is being added, this will be a 5 stars.","After I saw the trailer I bought the game because of its good price. In the game I saw that nothing from the trailer was there. No good graphics, low texture car buttons, no night mode and even my hands were blue. Don't buy the game until the dev decides to actually put a game for sale that's like the trailer but I wouldn't think that would be in the near future. I saw the game years ago and it has not changed a bit.","I love this game! I’m more confident than ever with this but the mirrors don’t work in the city and the steering would be better with 300 degrees or better. I would love to practice parallel parking on the street in the city but the city needs some updating and the mirrors don’t show traffic behind me… it doesn’t even show the buildings… in parking mode, everything is perfect","Love the game but it would be nice if there were a 300 degree on the steering wheel and on the free roam mode on the city the car ai is kinda confusing, when you play on the level where your driving a truck and there’s an another truck in the level could it be possible to make the distance where if your not that close enough the other truck the truck wouldn’t honk at you? Thank you and the game is really fun, enjoy playing it.",It’s a fantastic game with a fantastic experience but some things if added maybe in the next update the game would be better.Like more levels or more cars .more categories like free ride or racing also a multiplayer mode would be amazing
