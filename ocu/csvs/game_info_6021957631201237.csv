BoomSweeperVR,"Hands > Mice It’s as simple as that! BoomSweeperVR is a classic puzzle game re-imagined from a whole new perspective. Sit back, kick your feet up, and unwind with one of the most addictive and beloved games of all time. Only this time, playing feels more fun than ever! Featuring three levels of difficulty for both newcomers and seasoned 90’s desktop veterans. In BoomSweeperVR, your only goals are to relax and solve puzzles. In front of you, you see a board with covered tiles on it. Your goal is to uncover the entire board without detonating any bombs. Numbers on uncovered tiles show how many bombs are around it, and you can ‘flag’ the surrounding tiles to keep track of where you think bombs are. Once every bomb is flagged and every tile is uncovered, you win! Easy to understand, but difficult to master. Persistent data tracking records your best times and in-game statistics to help you improve your times and puzzle-solving skills. NO LOG-INS or any nonsense included, just pop on your VR headset and jump right into gaming! Just like you remember it! Whether you want to pop-in for 5 minutes or play for hours non-stop, BoomSweeperVR is better than ever!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Casual, Puzzle",English,1,Pleasant Hill Studio,Pleasant Hill Studio,https://johnsermarini.dev/boomsweepervr/,"Dec 24, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6021957631201237/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6021957631201237&r=1, https://johnsermarini.dev/boomsweepervr-privacypolicy/",366.8 MB,^^^^
