Should really receive a refund for this game from the maker in all fairness. Looks to have had copyright issues. _______________________________________ Remember that centipede scene from Pixels? Well you can now act it out yourself. This is fun to play but it has many problems. Gun handling sometimes all over the place / slow movement / picking up power-ups is a hassle (walk over them should be enough) / lack of leaderboards / appears centipede can't get you if you stand to the side. Apart from this, it is fun to play, but the asking price is a bit steep at present due to the game's problems. **UPDATE** Some of the criticisms have been addressed. Picking up power-ups is now much much easier. The centipede can get you everywhere now. Also great new dual-weapons have been introduced. Recommended.","Wow can't believe what a bargain it is, this is the sort of stuff vr was made for! This game has brought the classic 80s arcade machine kicking and screaming into the present. Easy to learn and pick up and play, love the way it's introduced even before you pick up that cannon to shoot the centipede and those pesky mushrooms ðŸ˜‚. Didn't notice any problems using the gun or aiming I think it's been updated since the previous reviews. Grab a pocket full of quarters, but the game and have fun blasting away cracking the high scores. 5*",Reminds me of those classic Arcade shooters from my childhood but reimagined in VR. Great fun trying to beat the scoreboard and lots of weapons upgrades as you level up to keep things interesting. Nice job!,I regret to inform my fellow YouTubers to not show this game on there channel as you will get a copyright notice from Atari !!
