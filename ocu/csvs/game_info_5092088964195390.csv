Shock Troops,"The Shock Troops are sent anywhere in the Galaxy where a problem needs to be solved with extreme prejudice. Players will shoot their way through an epic interstellar adventure and uncover a dark conspiracy to end mankind. Inspired by classics such as Doom and Quake, Shock Troops visual features include pixel-art textures and a mix of 3D environments and 2D sprites, seamlessly blending classic style with modern lighting. Shock Troops gameplay aims at preserving the high-octane physicality of the classic shooters. Players will dodge incoming projectiles while responding in kind with a varied arsenal with various effects, at range, or in melee, with some impressive weapons or special powers. You will be fighting your way through derelict space stations, frozen colonies, mining asteroids, large military spaceships, and lush alien planets. Each of these worlds will feature large “open” areas, set-pieces and theater of epic firefights.

I'm back in my youth playing Duke nukem in VR. I see what you were going for with this. The old school pixelated look, the weapons, the switch between open zones to tight narrow corridors, the pulsing music. Decent difficulty(i played it on harder I'm an original gamer) not the soft touch generation who've given you a 1 star review because 'it's too hard', or cry when they get a paper cut. Awesome work Bring me more!!!!! I'd love to get involved with anything else you might be planning. Any testing, early reviews you need because I think what you did is first class.","For a ten dollar game I'm impressed,its fun to play looks good and I believe it'll help me with my vr legs. I have the settings or comfort controls on high as it is rated intense and I'm fine for awhile,but eventually i must stop as all shooters affect me. I can get right back into this though in no time though andit's enjoyable, thats what will keep me coming back.","This game is close to perfection . First thing I noticed is how powerful the audio is when it comes to immersion. Shock Troops’ music selection and overall audio design is so epic. The atmosphere created by the audio on the third level was particularly awesome. Speaking of level 3, the enemies remained frozen until I shot at them. Not sure if that’s a difficulty setting mod or if the enemies activate based on your location something but I just thought that was a little off. Visuals design literally makes me feel like I was thrown inside of what a Super Nintendo game would be like. Super cool. Lastly, Bhaptics support is incredible! Only thing is, I really am having difficulty with finding a consistent way to get the game to sync up with the bhaptics devices. I tried all different combos. Start the game with devices on/off…nothing worked until it randomly did work. Synth riders worked without issue and I played synth riders right before Shock Troops. Kinda stumped as to why these connectivity inconsistencies are occurring. Maybe I’ll reach out to the devs.","I picked it up on a whim because I wanted something that felt like a classic fps in VR and I’m not too into rogue likes. I’m so glad I pulled the trigger on this game because it’s exactly what I wanted. The graphics look fantastic, the game is simple enough to get the hang of while also providing a decent challenge. I’m definitely hoping for a sequel or more add-ons in the future!",Game is definitely good. The only complain I have is the SLOW smooth turning speed which gives me nausea as theres no speed settings for smooth turning. And snap turning is just way too slow for this type of wave shooter game. For now I can only turn physically to turn in the game. Little patch can solve it I guess.
