Inspired by music mythology, Ionia is a fantasy world brimming with interactive plant and animal life.

The climbing is horrible, often resulting in glitches or falling randomly, I even had situations were I fell endlessly and had to shut off the game, and because it doesn't save any progress, had to start that horrible section again. Today I even had a thing where the climbing glitched so much I suddenly rose up in the sky, way above everything, then slowly fell down and ended in limbo, again having to reboot. And I tried again, this time my teleport logo was stuck, so couldn't go anywhere.... should be able to walk down the stairs, but could only do it by teleporting and that broke... Bad programming... and I really tried to like this... but what a mess.. and not even an option to refund anymore, as I tried to like this game, but the timeframe was up...",Love love this game I can't believe it ended I was looking forward to a long adventure beautiful graphic design please please make another one,"I really enjoyed this game…the aesthetic was nice, the game play was fairly simple, but what is more promising is that it can be seen where the future of this kind of gaming is going. Without putting game developers weights up too much, you can see spectacular landscapes/gamescapes, creatures and characters being crafted that will be profoundly compelling…perhaps more than non-extended reality!","The video preview and screenshots look dark and muted, but in game the visuals and environments are beautiful and immersive. The simple puzzles offer an invitation to explore, climb, interact with musical plants and animals, and soak up the gentle, peaceful atmosphere. The soundtrack includes soothing jungle sounds and beautiful music. An additional quest is mentioned right before the game ends, which makes the ending feel unexpected and abrupt. Perhaps it was meant to be a teaser for a future game. It feels good to know that 5% of proceeds go to support wildlife conservation, which is highlighted in a brief video presentation by Robert Irwin partway through the game. Despite being simple and short, I found it enjoyable and memorable. Thanks ROTU.","Everything felt magical! I loved exploring the interactive surroundings and truly feeling “in it.” It was sweet, gentle, I love that there was no violence. Did wish it was longer, though. The VR world needs more otherworldly magical uplifting experiences. Not more darkness. Thanks developers!"
