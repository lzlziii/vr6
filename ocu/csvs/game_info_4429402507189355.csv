As of now the only app that show’s promise is the dj’ing app but other than that, in terms of actually developing music there is a lot that is missing here. Adding a grid or grid snap for note placement would be a nice touch. In terms of how exactly you can write individual 4 bar loops (that play one after the other) I have no idea if that’s even a thing. If I’m writing music I want to be able to distinguish the different loops and have them play separately in order one after the other, rather than altogether. I understand this is in very early development but I hope this could be of some use. I like the idea of the app overall, I just think it needs a little more time to execute it more effectively.","I like to play this when wanting to wind down a little. I don't paint too much and just use the ""Fullscale"" pianos. I do wish there were stabilization settings for the brush, the lines come out all jagged. Great concept of an app.","First, thank you developers for this fun music game , it is a good idea for music learner like me. I like this idea. Please continue to add more music gameplay to this game if possible. Please make this music game easy to learn and fun to play as well. I don't have any music knowledge but want to play music for relaxation. More please. Thank you"
