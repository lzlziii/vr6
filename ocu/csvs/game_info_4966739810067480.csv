Dont buy this",I like the game its so scarry in hunted house it's its a cool game I am in the part with the pictures on the wall by the door sorry Wong game,"I enjoyed this one! Pretty similar to the affected: the Manor, but with some puzzle mechanics to it. Although they were pretty simple, I appreciated the addition. The downside is that the game is very short. It took me a little less than an hour to run through the whole thing. Outside of that, it's worth checking out.",I like it but I hope it gets some cool improvements and updates.,10/10 graph on a quest 2!!! Immersive story and environment. I liked the puzzles and a few times I nearly sh*t my pants.
