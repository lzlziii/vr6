Bugs 1. Constant Vibration while in a game 2. Hand and Puck phasing through table 3. Friend Menu not working Issues 1. No option to disable the holder falling off table, gets annoying after a while 2. No skins or customization for pucks and table etc. 3. No in-game profile system Overall this game is good and has a good premise and I am looking forward to the future of this game.",Basic but fun. A few different backgrounds that are decent and bots to play. Tried putting several picks on the table and that was fun too. Can customize them as well. Small download size too. Haven't tried hand tracking but that would make it better,"Fun to play, especially love the pass-through mode, but have tried everything to get friends in to play, can only play bots. Please fix this! I will check back after each update, but until then, this game only gets 1 star. Thank you. *UPDATE * Wow! Rapid response from developer! Thank you. Going to add back 2 more stars just for that. I will try suggestion and get back to you. Again, thank you for the rapid response.",yes,"Great game, works nice with Controllers. Hand Tracking still need some improvements. Feedback is heard fast from developer!"
