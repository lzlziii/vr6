Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye,"*** Now available for early access! Grab the first episode and secure a season pass to all four thrilling episodes releasing later this year. Dive into the adventure today and become part of the Retropolis legend! *** The story of Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye is set a year after the events depicted in The Secret of Retropolis, and continues the story of Philip Log, the hard-boiled robo-detective, and Jenny Montage, the automated femme fatale that just canâ€™t keep herself out of trouble. Nonetheless, Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye welcomes new visitors to the city of robots, and can be experienced as its own miniseries. The Retropolis series is a user-friendly VR experience built from the ground up to support effortless VR interaction. Using Philip Logâ€™s extendo-arms, the player is able to collect items from afar, use them to overcome obstacles, and move the plot forward. On top of the first gameâ€™s mechanics, Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye features enchanted logic puzzles, new rotation mechanics, and movement between different environments, offering a more challenging adventure with a substantially longer playtime. Even though set in a post-apocalyptic cityscape inhabited only by robots, all 3D assets in Retropolis 2: Never Say Goodbye were hand painted by living and breathing human beings, making each environment a stunningly detailed piece of art. With improved graphics and character animation, returning to Retropolis is more jaw dropping than ever.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Adventure, Interactive Story, Puzzle",English,0.4_ep1,Peanut Button,Peanut Button,http://peanutbutton.net/,"Jun 14, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6202929073076301/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6202929073076301&r=1, https://www.peanutbutton.net/privacy-policy-retropolis2",Terms of Service,1.68 GB,"I loved the first game, so I was really excited to hear about this one. For fans of the original, the gameplay is the same, as is the overall look and aesthetic. This is great for those who donâ€™t like it when sequels update things too drastically and stray away from what made the original game great. The puzzles are difficult at times, this game (gasp) makes you use the thinky-thinky parts of your brain! I did need to ask for help with a couple of the last puzzles, but overall I love how itâ€™s going and I look forward to playing the rest of the episodes when they come out!","I absolutely loved The Secret of Retropolis and was so excited that they came out with this 2nd one! The game feels and plays just like the first, so it is extremely well done. I think the puzzles are challenging but not over the top impossible. I did solve some by trial and error and others took me several long gazes around before I was able to complete them. The story line has kept me intrigued. It has an I Expect You to Die kind of vibe, and I love those games too! I find the light-heartedness of the game to be uniquely refreshing. I can't wait for the other episodes to release! All 4 episodes are included with the price of the game so looking forward to the updates!!","This amazing point-and-click adventure follows the first part (2 episodes) ""The Secret of Retropolis"" and keeps its unique style and atmospherics created and crafted in detail by hand in VR. It is not necessary to have played the first part but fans for sure did so and have been waiting for the continuation of the saga. Game mechanics also remain the same, playing seated or standing, turning around with the joystick and performing actions with the trigger. The story is narrated, parts of the dialogues can be chosen, and there are puzzles to be solved. For now, there is one episode playable, three more will be available in future and are included in the purchase. I am looking forward to the following episodes, thank you, dear Peanut Butter Team :-D","25 off for you: b I t , l y / R e t r o p o l i s 2 ( comma is a period, and remove all spaces. Also, itâ€™s case-sensitive - use capital R) A fun fusion of retro-futurism and a bit of secret society mystique - all in a stylish neo-noir atmosphere, complete with dive bars and gangster cars. A hard-boiled detective (thatâ€™s you) must solve the mystery of the missing femme fatale - a sultry starlet named Jenny Montage. Challenging puzzles - you might have to set it aside for a bit sometimes when you feel stuck - but donâ€™t be in too much of a hurry and youâ€™ll soon see the patterns and solutions. Great sequel with more episodes to come!",I really enjoyed playing the first episode. Can't wait for the other ones. The graphics are really nice. I loved the puzzles. Some were very tricky and others were just fun to figure out. I don't want to give away too much but who is going to come rescue me now... ðŸ˜‚
