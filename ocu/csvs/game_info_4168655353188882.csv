I tried it with my mom and she feel like she wanted to poop her pants. So bad but, Hey, I tried it. Dude, what would you put the face at the end? When he catches you, that's Camus so bad. I wouldn't be my argument today. Play a make a multiplayer from Play with my friends. A be my friend on oculus today, please. I'm so happy that you made this and if you know a dumb bus, if hes your friend, can you make him?","The game is graphically ok, however it is not scary at all to anyone who has played vr horror games for more than a week. The speed of the cat that catches up to you increases as you progress, however after you get the final object it becomes faster than you, making it a luck game. No fun after more than three attempts.","when i first played this i was scared outta my mind and i still am, the cat death screen is terrifying as hell, also a suggestion can you add multiplayer i would love to play with different players collecting.",Itâ€™s a very scary game in the beginning but also please add multiplayer with like 36 items to get,This is a great game but it would be better if there was multiplayer
