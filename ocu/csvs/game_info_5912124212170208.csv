Heads up on that, devs. It's very difficult to make combat feel great in VR. A lot of games try it and things end up feeling floaty or you feel like you're just flailing wildly. I'm happy to say that the combat in this game is a blast, which is great because combat is pretty much what you'll be doing when you play. The game also moves surprisingly well for how nice it looks on the Quest 2. Looking forward to playing it with friends. I couldn't find a smooth turning option so I hope that is also added at some point.","I played this game for 1 hour and I love it but here or somethings I would like to see in the furture (if possible) 1) classes (diffrent kind of class like assassins, knight, archer, mage, ect) (yes you have a bow and sword and shield together but it would be awesome in multiplayer for people to have diffrent specialty) 2) MAGIC (cmon you know it would be cool to trow fire balls and freeze enemies)(I know you can have ice arrows and stuff but magic on its own would be cool) 3) This is the multiplayer part not a suggestion (I wanted to play with a friend but when I got to the point where I can play co-op I didn’t know how to invite a friend in a private lobby or even if it’s a thing plz help) 4) this is the problem I have so far (I made it to the first boss but I couldn’t figure out how to beat him when the blue bar disappeared or mabye he just has a hell of a lot of heath but either way idk if it’s normal) Yes this is long but plz replie with answers to the 2 last points and take in consideration the 2 suggestion","1. Max level player : 50 bow : 40(+10)->(+additional 15/can be failed) sword : 42(+10) 2. best skill -damage 50%+ -all lv3 dash damage+dash reward+50% dmg = infinite dash attack more powerful than max lv sword. except boss&stone archer, all enemies will be instantly died. -5 arrows -3 magic swords -vampire 3. priority bow > sword > player level can clear with only bow, but later in challenge mode, sword will be more important. craft > upgrade 4. never sell crystals. hard to get them again. can gather gold through repeat playing AFTER getting final weapons, selling is ok 5. Magic ice(freeze) > shock(slow)> fire(dot dmgx5 times) but later in tough difficulties, fire can be a good option. in most games, piercing means ignoring armor, but in this game literally pierces target, so hit another monster behind the first target. 6. bend your knee in front of Mila and Vivian, watching carefully you can find Easter eggs.","Once again a ""fight waves of enemies"" game is given a trailer to make it look like an open rpg. I could forgive that, but the controller movement is broken, 3 gig update with no fix or mention of issues. And yet EVERY review is 5 stars. Very few of the reviews even mention wnything to do with the actual gameplay. META store has me sick with distrust now. Cant believe a trailer or reviews. Yet TONS of good VR games out there my good old quest dont have? Very disappointed and I have spent hundreds on games.","I found this game on a whim about a week or two ago and thought it looked interesting, and I've been playing it almost daily since I've bought it. Incase that and the star count didn't give it away, I think this game is pretty good. This is a combat focused game, and I'm pleased to say the combat is very good. You have two weapons, your sword and your bow. Both of them have their benifits. The Bow is a ranged attack that has infinite ammo that'll always be ready to fire whenever you pull the string, and the sword is typically a stronger weapon which can dish out more damage faster. Your sword will also give you a shield whenever you hold it out which you can use to block incoming damage, but enemies can break it if it absorbs too much damage at once. Your base movement speed is pretty slow, but despite that the combat manages to feel very fast paced. For one you move faster whenever you aren't holding any weapons, meaning you can more easily reposition yourself in bad situations. You also have a teleport dash, a very useful move with many purposes. You can use it to create distance between your enemies to use the bow, bait more aggressive foes into running from the other enemies for an easier takedown, hop onto an enemy and get aggressive yourself, make last minute dodges, grab all your item drops quick when you clear a floor, this move does it all. It does have a cooldown and needs to charge back up after using it, but the default dash count the game gives you should be more than enough as long as you use them wisely. All the enemies in this game have very distinct designs and easily telegraphed attacks, meaning you'll likely memorize their patterns very quick. The main challenge of the game is all about learning the attack patterns of the enemies that spawn in the arena and determining the best way to defeat them. Knowing which ones need to be taken out first, how to best evade oncoming damage from other foes, how to bait them into a favorable situation and the best weapon fit for taking each down is the key to slashing through hordes of enemies. All of this combined is what makes this game's combat so satisfying and what makes this game so fun. At the end of the day though, this game is a roguelike. Every floor has randomized enemy formations, the power ups you get are randomized, and you go all the way back to the start when you die. You always get one free revive at the start of each run, but aside from that once you're dead, you're dead. The whole goal of the game is to get stronger and stronger each run, which can be done in two ways. You can naturally level up as you play the game, but you also have your central hub. Here you can use the items enemies drop to craft new weapons and use gold to upgrade said weapons. There's also a shop where you can spend gold for items, but I rarely even use it for that, instead i just sell all my weapon drops and then spend my gold on upgrading my gear. Now here's the area where I think the game can improve. You kinda just tend to pile up in your inventory with no real use for them. Swords and bows are the only weapon types in this game, and once you get powerful ones there's no real reason to keep any other weapona in your inventory. As much as I like the current combat, it kinda a shame how there's pretty much no difference between them aside from their damage. It's be so cool if this game had a more varied roster of weapons. What if we had greatswords, or battle axes, or spears, or whips, or maybe just going in punching enemies with a pair of gloves? What about your other hand? What if we had crossbows, or throwing hatchets, or a flintlock pistol? Why not go a step further? Why not have a spell book or magic staffs that can cast spells? We already have magic to some degree in the game with elemental swords and arrows, it'd be even cooler to see actual spells. At the very least, it would further reduce the tedium of repeatedly playing the same floors over and over again. Granted the hard mode that scales up enemy levels somewhat midigates that already and going through previous floors is still a decent chunk of fun, but this game eats up battery fast. You only have about an hour or so with this game before your headset needs to recharge, meaning you'll usually only have time for one run on a full charge. I know it's a roguelike and the whole starting over when you die thing is a staple of the genre, but I just want to get to the later floors so I can actually spend my battery life grinding what i want. That's another area where the game needs some work. It either needs a level select or some serious battery optimization. Overall though, this game is very good. It shreds through your battery life and could use some weapon variety, but what's here now is extremely fun and satisfying. I would absolutely recommend giving this game a go."
