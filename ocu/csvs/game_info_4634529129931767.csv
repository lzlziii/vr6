Retro Bricks 1982,"When I bought the Oculus Quest, about a year after its release, my first goal was to create a game I would be proud of. While digging into my memories, I remembered that I used to spend hours challenging a great classic from my childhood: MicroVision's Brick Breaker. Since the original version in 1976, many variants have emerged. But I hope you'll enjoy mine, Retro Bricks 1982, both retro & modern. The beta version here contains 15 test levels, some music and hopefully a lot of fun! I wish to be able to offer the final version in the next few weeks. In the meantime, don't hesitate to send me your feedback!

This is the diamond of the gems!,This game is freaking awesome. I love that it's an old favourite of mine in a futuristic vibe .10 out of 10. Thank you.,"The balls move way too fast even in Easy mode. I couldn't get through even the first level most of the time. There should be some kind of speed slider that adjusts the ball speed automatically with a negative score multiplier so that it can accommodate anyone's skill level. It also has some kind of selection problem when selecting menu options; it seemed to restrictively need me to point at exactly a part of any letter in a menu word, which is hard with the narrow font. They should be buttons with a margin around the words that you can select and still access. I enjoyed the graphics and overall presentation otherwise but just couldn't play the game for > 5 min due to these quality-of-life problems.","I wasn't sure what to expect but this game was a lot of fun. The controls are extremely well done, the graphics and game play are awesome and although I only played for a few minutes so far, it was a great game. The developer clearly put in a lot of work. It's definitely worth a try.","I Love it, Great job. Flash back to the 80s and it works well. Thank you. Omg more coming, that's Great news. I'm getting excited my friend."
