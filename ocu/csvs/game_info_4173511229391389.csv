Add to that the idea that you have to *pay* for a hint, and it's an absolute pass for me. Also, I don't know if it's another bug or part of the actual design of the room, but when ""The Great Room"" first started, somehow I already had a pink-flaming spear, but by the time I found the first three cystals, somehow that spear either disappeared or had gone out. I don't know if I was supposed to find the pink crystal (and if so, how - I felt like I solved everything available) to regain the pink flame, or if that spear was supposed to remain available to me, to complete the ten-step light sequence. Either way, made for a very frustrating experience.",I really liked the first few levels although the controls take a bit of getting used to. I would definitely recommend someone to try it even for the first 3 or 4 levels as the puzzles are really fun and not too easy at all but definitely doable (there is also a hint system). The game has fun collectibles and leaderboards for each room too. It took me a while to figure out what did what for the controls even with the labels and sometimes placing things where you wanted them to be was a little more challenging than it should be but overall it wasn't too much of an issue and I still enjoyed the puzzles level 1: more of an opportunity to figure out the controls than a good puzzle but very necessary level 2: very fun room interactions and puzzles level 3: you may not want to finish it but definitely start it. Puzzles are easily found but fun to finish. However it involves a mini game (the dreaded barrels...) that is quite hard to complete level 4: fun but too easy? I think maybe less information needs to be given so its more about finding missing information rather than matching level 5: (disclaimer: I have not finished this one as it seems very long and haven't had the time yet) For the other rooms I don't mind that there isn't a save feature as they don't take too long but the puzzles are quite long for this one so think it might be necessary or it should be split into different levels but maybe that is part of the challenge,I stuck in the warroom. Cant finish the speer and shield. No way. I payed money for a hint but all I got is what I allready know. Shoot the barrels. Thats not okay. Sorry. I quit after trying hard.,"This game could be a lot of fun if it just wasn't so buggy! The actual rooms themselves are really fun! Sure, some of the puzzles need to be easier (I'm looking at you barrel shooting game) or harder, but overall it they were really fun! Now what wasn't so fun was the camera and movement. I don't tend to get motion sick in VR but I can't play for very long in this game. Also some of the physics and collision needs to be worked on. Luckily there's not much you need to throw anyway but when you do throw something, it will either go really far or nowhere. Rarely will it go where you wanted it to. Then if you move around too fast or if there's a lot loaded in, the game gets REALLY choppy. Let's break it up by level now. Level 1: alright but just too short. Level 2: Pretty fun and had some fairly challenging puzzles Level 3: overall fun but the shooting mini games could use some work. Level 4: fun but simple. The scroll puzzle could be a little more difficult. Level 5: Don't even bother. It's confusing as it doesn't really point you to what's you need to do. The first challenge is easy once you figure out what's happening and doing the challenge is really fun. The second challenge needs to have some kind of instructions for the controls at very least. Even once I figured those out, it still made me motion sick. The third challenge is just awful to the point that I couldn't make it further. It's not really clear as to what's happening, or what your goal is, or even what your actually doing for that matter. And before you can even figure it out, there are so many enemies spawned in that the game becomes just still shots every few seconds. I thought flipping the switch to turn it off and back on would reset it but no. After slowly crawling my way back to the lever, I turned it off and the smoothness came back. I then flipped the lever again to try the challenge again but instead of starting from the beginning of the challenge, it picked up right where it left off. All the previous enemies spawned back and the frame rate went back to awful in a split second. Last thing, it needs a save feature. I truly wish I could give this game a higher rating because the level design and most of the puzzles are actually really fun, but until this game fixes all of it's big issues (especially the Dungeon level), I just can't fairly give it a better rating.",It need a save button and it needs to be where you can add multiple players like one person plays it then when they get off like another person to play it but not have to start in the same place as the other person was at that would be fun I love the game love aspect of it but overall love it
