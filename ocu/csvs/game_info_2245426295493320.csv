Many of the apps I use are like one of the fun activities that I engage in when I go out from my Solaris home on weekends. Solaris also has a great and unique community. GoldenEagle",Solaris won’t launch. What’s the issue?!!,You can never connect. Has major issues. I never even got to play a single game. Save your money.,"It’s just a flatscreen game taped to your face, it wasn’t very fun when it was active and now you can’t even find a server, save your money and just skip this one",I got the game about a week ago and i regret it. The concept is great but i never actually get put into a game. I got into one game but it never started because there was only 2 people in the lobby. I walked around and got myself familiar with the guns and arena for a solid 40 minutes without the game ever starting. Now every time I go on my headset i try to get into a match. I sit there for 10 minutes and don't get into a match. If they fix this it is worth buying. But please don't waste your money on a game that doesn't work. Please.
