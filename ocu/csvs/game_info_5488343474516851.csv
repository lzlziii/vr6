When I first got it I had doubts that it would be fun because it was a demo. But it’s a demo that isn’t like any other. It’s not like when you complete it you have to buy the whole game. This is the full game so far and I love it. I just love running around with impact grenades and slamming them on the ground and getting multiple kills and just laughing. If I could give more then 5 stars I’d give it 10 out of 10 stars. As much as I love the game there’s some more features I wanna see. 1. More SMG’s, Shotguns, Pistols, AR’s and BR’s. 2. A Semi Automatic Sniper Rifle 3. Grenade Launchers or Rocket Launchers 4. More grenades 5. More Melees (eg; a frying pan) 6. More attachments on guns. 7. Different Ammo types (eg: explosive bullets) 8. The ability to dual wield pistols 9. No weapon progress resets when the full game comes out 10. Healing Items Even if these features don’t get added I’m still going to love playing the game the way it is.","Hax is a AMAZING game that has a lot of ￼potential, I have spent countless hours of fun playing this. Im sad that this game hasn’t been updated for about a year now, I am hoping that this game hasn’t been abandoned.",My favorite things about it are 1. art style 2. Guns 3. Maps 4. Weapon mods 5. Simple but immersive,"I love this game so much i want the full game to come out now so I can play with more melees,more grenades,and more guns and attachments.",I love you so much
