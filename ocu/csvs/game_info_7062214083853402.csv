HUNGRY ANIMALS,"This game gives you the same experience as making donuts in real life. Put donut dough in a fryer, cook it properly, and make delicious donuts with glaze and topping. If you have coffee orders, don't forget to give them coffee, too! Shall we cook so that animals can eat donuts within the time limit?
