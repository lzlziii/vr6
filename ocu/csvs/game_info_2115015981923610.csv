Death Horizon: Reloaded,"The Horizon scientific research laboratory is a deceptively quiet place. When you came round, there were hundreds of the living dead all around you. All because of that damn T12 virus. To survive and save the world from the virus, use both hands and your head: never stop shooting, pick up rounds, climb up pipes and ladders, jump onto bars and grab hold of ropes, search cupboards and throw everything you find at the zombies. You‚Äôre free to choose whatever weapons and tactics you want. Prove your agility, imagination and accuracy. The denizens of the Horizon station will punish you for one thing: hesitation. * FEATURES * ‚óè Realistic bloody graphics in the spirit of zombie apocalypse films ‚óè Use two controllers actively: fire with both hands, fire as you hang on a rope, reload your shotgun with your second hand, grab onto pipes and explore hard-to-reach areas of the station",16+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Horror, Shooting","English, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish (Spain)",0.9.41,Dream Dev Studio LLP,Dream Dev Studio LLP,http://deathhorizon.com/,"Sep 26, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2115015981923610/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2115015981923610&r=1, http://deathhorizon.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,1.70 GB,"Omg! Tons of changes and improvements in Death Horizon: Reloaded playing in team player mode with a guy friend, but I was outta practice. Literally just was that girl panicking and screaming and dying and laughing so goddam hard! THANK YOU! This zombie game makes me happy even when life is utterly crappy! I don't think I've screamed that much in a house unless it was haunted or I was having sex! Lol All of the above are a great time!!!!! Meow! üòª","This game, in my opinion, is better than Arizona sunshine. It‚Äôs also cheaper (I think). The graphics, guns, and effect are top notch, and the climbing ability definitely adds more enjoyment to the game. Every time I play it‚Äôs an adrenaline rush, especially because once you pass a section, zombies still might spawn at get you from behind. As far as socialization, I would like to see a future mode added where you can play with more than just one other person, but I understand this might take a bit. (Arizona Sunshine has better team play fun. But the one on one has its benefits, that‚Äôs why I would like to see a different mode instead of just adding more player slots). This game is truly worth the money and with the 5.1 and 5.2 levels added. I am exited to see what the next levels bring. (Arizona Sunshine is a great game too, but is a bit expensive.)","It's good and sometimes fun but the problem with this game is stress. Half of it is intentional however. Problem is that you need a big area you can wander about in because if you're climbing through the vents which you can only do with your hands, then you'll have to physically turn your body and you cant use the stick. Which is annoying. Also the guns are pretty good but they're a big fiddle about sometimes, it's not always clear what will register as a weapon holster. Big issue is the melee weapons dont work. They're a tutorial for it at the start but I died 9 times trying to do it because I hit the undead jammy doger factory worker in the head with my massive stiff bat and nothing happens. Very annoying. Plus the levels are very generic and basically the same. To the point where you are going down corridors and you know where the zombies are going to come from because they came from those vents either side of the door to the level last five times so why not again? Not reason why not, and they do. I quit playing when I glitched through the level because I peeked out of a vent and my head accidentally went through the wall and I fell through the map and died. Actually that's I lied, I quit the 6th time that happened because by then I was really too angry. My summary is that its functional and you can use it but its unfinished and could have been a good game but it's clearly been a project that someone gave up on at some point.","This game is really cool, I slept in it for a while but just got it on the showcase sale and honestly I would have paid full price. It's a lot of fun, Single player campaign that doesn't require the internet which is a plus for me. And you can smash things... Wide open haha. Great jobs guys looks like you keep an eye on it too! -Cbreezey1990 Feel free to browser my linktree for all my other favorite games too. It's only ones I keep and like, 8 years in VR overall so I think I know what to look for maybe lol üôÇ Linktr (dot) ee/cbreezey1990",Great game however the only thing I would change is that the game should have an option in team play to do a private lobby and you can invite your friends and not have random people join. It could have a code or something that you could send your friends to type in so they can join your private lobby/co-op. Just make a private thing where it can be just playing with friends. Other than that great game.
