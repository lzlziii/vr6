With Blast Corps style missions of ""blow x amount of these away"". Boom, you have Hammer 2. Yes, it's as fun as that sounds. I'll admit, this game won't win any awards for astounding art style. It is simplistic N64-esque graphics with charm sprinkled in. Graphics of this nature do have their strong suits however. Because the graphics are simple, the draw distance is insane. No backgrounds cutting out and vague fog in the distance. No, you can clip a guy with a helicopter a few hundred yards out no problem. Loading times are non-existent. And everything is destructible. The premise is simple, start with your basic gun, destroy the mission objectives, earn cash by playing, buy upgrades like a jetpack or a better starter weapon and annihilate accordingly. Here's the twist; you can pilot anything. Any car. Any turret. Any tank. It's yours. These missions can be completed just about any creative way of your choosing. Combine that with the unlockables and you have yourself some serious replay value. The music is suffice. There to pump you up but never really obnoxious. The sound fx work for the genre and art style and all help you feel submerged in your fully destructible N64 world. The controls for the most part are fast paced and works for the fast paced, destroy everything play style this game has. But there are issues. Too touchy at times. Controlling a helicopter the guns seems to get stuck firing a certain direction. You adapt but it is annoying. The cars, you have to press up to accelerate but you often lose the acceleration when turning. To be honest, the controls need some work, especially the various vehicles You adapt, it's still fun, they serve their purpose most of the time but it's certainly not consistent or smooth. My only real complaint with this title so far. To final verdict: I probably would have given a real 4/5 score for the controls but this game is insanely fun and deserves a score boosting 5/5. At the end of the day, we play games to have fun. With all of it's cute little quirks, it absolutely nails the fun factor. Like great arcade games of old, where the joy stick occasionally jams or the screen flickers, it doesn't detract from the solid gameplay and the good times had. Absolutely get this game!","Imagine Minecraft, gta3, max Payne and twisted metal all as one game‚Ä¶yeessss‚Ä¶.I do not see what people are complaining about? Sure the graphics and sound are super simplistic but that‚Äôs the whole point! It‚Äôs an arcade shooter. Your objective on all the levels is simple, destroy things. This is a hidden gem üíé in the app lab trash heap that is actually plain stupid fun! I don‚Äôt get the other reviewers, the car is simple to drive‚Ä¶.just don‚Äôt crash it‚Ä¶ Get this! Update‚Ä¶. This game is so simple addictive!","Me and my son playing this game and this game is right now my most occupied game that got me back playing the quest. I love the arcade style, fps, slot of levels to play. ü§ôüèΩü§ôüèΩ",This is possibly the worst VR game I've ever gotten. Not only is it very repetitive but it's very annoying how expensive the in-game shop items are it feels way too grinding and there's no difficulty setting.
