The narration is entertaining and the episode makes the most of the VR space to engage the viewer.,"Story is told with quite broad strokes and I found it a bit boring. Would have liked to see more examples of the art from the three ""schools"", and some personal letters or diaries from key artists. Pointilism is also problematic in VR as the headset resolution is too low, causing aliasing. In order to perceive this painting better, you would need to enlarge parts of it, or move the camera closer.","Overall though, this is very artsy and good.",I enjoyed this and would love to see more like it. The graphics could be better but it was interesting and cool. Thanks devs!,"Really lovely use of the Quest. A story of a painting, and the life story of the Painter told really beautifully through VR. Thoroughly enjoyable and interesting even for those with a passing interest in art. I hope this is the first of many, as certainly would be a great way to get the history of art to the masses in a very approachable manner. Well done üëç"
