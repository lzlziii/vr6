Despite the wonderful little games the behavior of the whiteboards, the possibility to share files, the privacy areas or creating notes makes this app a real collaboration space that is actually usable. Thanks for that! Here are some bugs we found: - Clicking a button (e.g. terms and conditions) is not always possible (I almost deleted the app, as I was not able to get beyond the privacy screen) - The aeroplane in the Remio Public Server is shown three times one in the other (clipping or model copied) - Created whiteboards can not be moved around the z-axis - In Paintball the winner's podium does not appear for all players - Picking up items like the bow, feels clumsy But these issues are al minor. The app is great and I will definitely keep it!",The game is good but it's very similar to recroom it's like they copy rec room models,"Remio is the perfect social space to supplement the education programming we provide in VR. It is perfect for hosting business meetings, team building events, classes, or just having fun doing Paintball or other fun activities. I have been using this app for over a year and it just keeps getting better.","The environments are beautifully rendered, and there is the perfect amount of interactivity. It's the perfect balance of work and play as you have tools for presenting slides or assets, and after meetings, you are free to do team building activities by connecting to native experiences or external apps.","This app has a lot of functionality for businesses and education. The portal doors can go off to other apps, the games can be played by HR and teams, the whiteboard and sticky notes are wonderful for chatting, and the conference room can have 3-D objects uploaded to examine while in a presentation. If you have not checked out this app you must do so. This needs to be in the main oculus store right now."
