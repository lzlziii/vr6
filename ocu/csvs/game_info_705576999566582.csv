Come on devs! Quit giving us bullcrap answers! We know you aren’t going to do crap to fix it. Never buying a game from Oculus again! Don’t buy it they are scamming you out of your money! Just buy MLB The Show or First Person Tennis instead.","My 12 year old son gifted this game to me, so we could play together while I was on the road. Unfortunately this function does not work, defeating the purpose of the purchase. The developers have said for months that they were working on the issue, but the game is still not fixed. Do not buy if you plan on playing with friends.",I played tennis and it was difficult at first but got easier. So I tried baseball and every time I play I get smoked in the first inning by at least 17 points because the fielders for my team can’t catch a ball to save their lives yet the ai team catch over 70% of my hits. My little brother who is 8 can’t even win one game on easy because of how hard it is.,"I like this game it’s pretty fun to be able to play the scramble mode when you feel like you want something different and normal mode when you just want to feel like you are really playing that sport (mostly except for some bad things that don’t). A few problems are that in baseball taking a pitch is impossible it just says you hit the ball and it’s a weak contact out I see a ball in the top so I don’t move or turn my bat away I look back and they are catching it. And, to add on to that anytime you swing the bat it’s a hit if the ball is in or close to the strike zone even if it’s in the top right corner and you swing down at the left I tried it also if you swing at a pitch that’s way outside the zone and whiff Its not a strike so it feels very hard to take a pitch and play the game like it’s real and it spawns you in the middle of the box so the strike zone is like a foot in front of you. And it is impossible to get an out my team always botches it. Moving on to tennis, it is fun but you can’t move side to side. I will get a ping pong paddle and they hit a ball like near the edge of the alley and it’s impossible to hit back and with a normal racket I get balls on my backhand side that I whiff on if I swing good time so I need to swing early which results in me hitting it out even if I try to curve it and bowling is simple like the real sport and fun I don’t see any problems. So overall it’s a pretty good game but my favorite sport to play on this is baseball and it’s my second favorite overall sport so it really is annoying to have these things that change it when I hit I’m in the front of the box and when the other team hits a weak ball that my team can’t get and I hit rockets that the other team catches the ratio of my errors to theirs are like 10:1 which is annoying when I overcome one of these things then error after error.","I liked the demo of the game so I decided to buy it. I like it for the cardio. I lean more towards the tennis and bowling. What I don’t like about it, it’s hard to find someone to play with. I find it rare to have someone signed on to play against. I can’t figure out how to add someone that I’m friends with to play me. So I end up playing against the computer most of the time which is the part I hate. I think playing baseball against the computer is a total waste of time. The robots catch everything no matter what. I like playing tennis although I find when I’m losing the game, my challenger all of a sudden start hitting the ball out so I can catch up. I tested it. That takes the fun out of it. Let what happens happen. Bowling seems to be the most fair to me. All in all, I still play it."
