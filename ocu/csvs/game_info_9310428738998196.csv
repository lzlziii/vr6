Can't wait to finish what's here and so looking forward to whatever comes next. Would happily pay for dlc, but will appreciate any free updates as well! :) Absolutely worth full price!

I would invest in this game's content for as long as VR exists as long as they keep producing quality like this. There was a demo previously released and we thought that it couldn't get any better than that. They even added an optional hint system that we found accidentally by pressing some buttons, which we found rather helpful at one point in the game. The graphics are actually quite beautiful and it was amazing to hear the sounds and look around at what was happening as the game developed. I really don't want to spoil anything for anyone but at one point my heart nearly jumped out of my chest in the best way possible. I don't like to play scary games so this wasn't exactly a scare but it was really awesome when ""the next puzzle"" would sort of reveal itself for problem-solving. I still don't always know 100% how we figured something out... there was 1 section when we were turning dials and we couldn't find the proper clues. So we guessed and guessed and finally got it right. No frustration at all though. The visuals keep you engaged and I honestly just couldn't get enough. We played as a group of 3 and were thrilled with the surprise reward for completion. Oh, and I should add that the accessibility of this game is fantastic. I'm always looking for seat-friendly games that are mindful of controller and body movement that feels more inclusive for those of us with some limitations in our movement. This game met my needs for that as well.","I consider myself an escape room expert. I've completed nearly 40 rooms across 4 states, Scotland, and Australia. I've also done nearly every tabletop escape room. So far, 5 out of the 6 chapters in this game have been an excellent example of top-notch room design. The only disappointing one is chapter 3 of the Asylum. It is really short and too simple compared to the other chapters. The ending is also too similar to the other scenario, so it kinda cheapens the experience. All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys puzzles or escape rooms. 5 stars alone just to be able to play alongside a friend. Can't wait for more.","Outstanding game, a true gem of a title, great puzzler alone, head and shoulders above the rest in multiplayer, puzzles are clever enough to need thinking about, but simple enough to succeed with minimal frustration, played it with two of my kids and they had a marvelous time working the rooms out. Can't wait to see the new adventures coming our way, really excited to see what the future holds for this title",This game was so much fun to play with my friends as I am not good at escape room experiences. Right now it is a little short as there are only two rooms with a total of six levels. They have another room on the way though that will give this game the 5 stars it deserves. The graphics are really nice and the puzzles challenging but not too hard. Over all a great time to be had.
