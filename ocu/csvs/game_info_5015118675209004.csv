It’s definitely going to stand out among the VR Horror titles. I couldn’t get past the doctor after the “Mosquito Bite” scene due to him running in place and then killing me when I let him get unstuck lol Ultra settings shouldn’t be available for the Quest 2 because the performance is volatile to the hardware.

Point, click, hope you're right.",This is really atmospheric. Gory brilliant graphics. And the creepy background sounds. Christ it’s eerie but in a great way. Mechanics not too bad
