Everyone must have imagined flying through the sky wearing an iron suit. This is a good game that allows you to experience it virtually. Iron Man's unique hand movements when moving through the air are also implemented very similarly through controller. Nice graphics, good gameplay and many interesting chapters with different concepts. As with most Marvel games, It's a pity that we can't see Robert Downey Jr. as it is due to royalty issues. ^^; I wish someday I could experience more suits, stories, and free mode through DLC. Was this helpful? If so, plz press the üëç button. :D",This is another one that is a absolute must have!! This is by far in the top 5 best games for oculus and that's facts folks. I wasn't even an iron man fan at first and cause of this game I now have seen all the movies so pretty cool how a game can do that especially to someone like myself. Also save urself some money and go to l i n k t r period ee slash mr 12gage330 just make sure words are together and not spaced lol check out others too.,"At first I thought it was going to be boring because in the beginning there‚Äôs a tutorial and I thought the whole game would be like that‚Ä¶ but after your done with that part, the game is AWESOME! You fly through buildings! You fly around the helicarrier, through mountains! You land on a plane! THIS GAME IS LIVE!!! You can upgrade your Ironman suit with different weapons as you progress through the game! The story is also extremely engaging!!! Dooooode this game is FUN worth every single penny! üòéüî•","This game went above and beyond with my expectations, I wasn't expecting a story that would last for a total of 6 hours, probably the most fun PvE content on the platform, and the masterfully designed flight system, at first it sounds hard, which, it is, but once you get the hang of it (it won't be long) it becomes second nature, and it'll be as natural as walking. 10 long and fun missions telling it's story about Tony, trying to change himself, but a Ghost from his past remains still to haunt him, along with a unexpected plot twist that I'll let you figure out. Over 30 different and unique upgrades total for your suit and PLENTY of different colors to choose from, so you won't be lacking in different colors, or auxillary weapons to choose from. All done and completed in a interactive upgrade, right in Tony's garage. Go upstairs, and you'll find weights, a punching bag, and an arcade basketball game. I reccomend you visit it between missions to fully explore the game. Some objects early on even have voice line Easter eggs for you to find as well! My only two complaints, is that there is only 6 different enemy types (minus bosses), and that ""Iron Man"" by Black Sabbath didn't play at the end of the game. Otherwise, it's perfect. You will NOT be disappointed by this game, I wasn't a iron man fan before playing this game, now, I am. (Iron Man)","So many VR games feel like they're only 70% of the way there. This is 100%. Iron man in VR gives me the same feeling I had as a kid swinging as spiderman on my family's desktop computer. It's a complete experience, with a fair amount of customization, full environments, a complete if somewhat predictable story, good voice acting, and solid graphics for a standalone quest 2 game. It doesn't feel like anything is missing, and flying through the sky as Iron Man has been a thrill. When you start becoming competent it is one of the better feelings I've had in VR lately.
