Mixeal Apartment,"Explore a double story apartment where you have the ability to change the design style to either contemporary, Georgian or Mediterranean with a click of a button. There are few technologies as immersive as VR, which can digitally put you in the shoes of a person walking around a building/home. While it may seem like an expensive investment, it helps your business in the long run. You don't need to stage or show properties in person as much if you have VR tech ready to go. This demo showcases the potential of VR for Archviz and Real Estate industry and an example of work we provide at Mixeal.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Art/Creativity,English,1.0,Mixeal,Mixeal,http://www.mixeal.com/,"Aug 4, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4144963725618590/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4144963725618590&r=1, https://pages.flycricket.io/mixeal-apartment/privacy.html",551.9 MB,I liked the app. Great decorating ideas. I wish there were more style options and I wish you could pick different furniture and personalize the home as you wish.,Really great quality demo of what can be achieved in ArchVis applications. I strive to get the same quality from my own work. Well done.,I couldn't really do anything in this app I couldn't move forward/ back/side to side..I get only spin around 360 and change the decorations from one theme to another!!,"There are a few typo: - at first, you have to use the right controller as the left controller cannot interact with changing the furniture. - There is a sign upstairs saying to press A with the left controller... well A is on the right controller.",please add more content like this. I can pay for this.
