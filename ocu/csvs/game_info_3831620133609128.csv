GRRRRR !! Very frustrating !! None of the forevr games connecting to internet..,DⓂ️ME FOR A DISC🅾️UNT C🅾️DE 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ THANKS! ITS AN AWESOME GAME BTW,"Why do all of ForeVR Games have to require an internet connection, especially when you play in single player It? It kills the game preservation in the long term. Also they've banned me on all social media sites because I mention this to them. Look what happened to Echo VR and Nerf Ultimate Championship. Both online games of which are shutting down, one of which, Nerf, was a paid game. Why does this one require online even when there is a single player mode? Just make an offline mode so when you eventually shut down the games, which you will eventually, we can still play this game. I posted a discussion on Steam for ForeVR Bowl and Pool and got banned from the discussions of both games for ""consistent harassment of devs"" which isn't true. I just asked why the game had to be online. Avoid this game at all costs.","I'm a fan of the ForeVR games, especially the bowling but darts and maybe it's just me just isn't my strong suit. Seems like it's harder than it should be however that's not gonna stop me from trying. I really really like bowling so I'm definitely not giving up on the team and plan on getting ForeVR pool next. Bonus coins and items for having the other games comes in handy and is a nice thank you as well. 🤘😊 Thanks ForeVR",I gave it four stars because it’s Great game but the hand tracking needs a bit of working on but everything apart from that is great I love how you can put music on in the background and getting coins and buying new darts I have had the game since it came out and I’m loving it 😊
