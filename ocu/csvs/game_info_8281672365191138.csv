Multiplayer could make it so the Ôøº aggression Ôøºlevel on the enemies where Ôøº amped way up Ôøº But such a great game 10/10 i jumped when i heard #2 had came out. But yea, multiplayer?",I searched the game up I‚Äôm already scared to download it broüíÄ but can you add a version where you can play multiplayer?ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫,"i am not even kidding this game is absolute garbage. We went from cool and shiny looking good models to f???ing moving jpegs. This game isn‚Äôt even original too, they copy rush from doors and make him without sound and can only be seen a few times on the map. This is getting out of hand and we need the old movement system back. back then it used to be a scary crawlspace with dark atmosphere, now we have jumping like in gorilla tag in a vent? I‚Äôm not even mad at this point, i‚Äôm disappointed. So please if you don‚Äôt mind just add to this d$mb f$ck called henry or whatever have sound or at least not be INVISIBLE. Excluding that paragraph, the whole game is awesome and still creepy. (Not as the old one) i still recommend buying and giving it a 5 star like i will now.","And replaced it with gorilla tag movement. The ‚Äúenemies‚Äù are cut up 2d jpegs instead of models, and the game explains nothing about the enemies until you die to them. One of the enemies is constantly crawling through the vents without a sound, and while you do a puzzle there is literally no way to know he is directly behind you. The crawling is also dam horrible, and you are not even in a dingy creepy crawl space, but instead you bounce around a shiny vent. Don‚Äôt even play, you‚Äôll just get disappointed"
