With some escape rooms the developers make it too obvious as to how to complete the tasks! The tasks in this game are very well thought out, and lots of hidden features which is amazing! It really taxes the brain and this is what these games should be about. The developer has done an amazing job. Game is now extended, so you escape one room! To find yourself in another and so on, some of the tasks take a little while to figure out! However they do become clear so don‚Äôt give up to easily. I was pleasantly surprised. Graphically it‚Äôs great, and very smooth game play! So very clever how mechanical ‚öôÔ∏è this game is also!! Well done 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è from me! I managed to escape and was a very good ending! However I think the black spots need to be addressed, as if you get too close to anything everywhere blacks out. Highly recommend this game! And it‚Äôs a bargain price üòâ Game has just had an update!! August 2023 üî• let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs added can‚Äôt wait","Let me first say that I love this concept and the graphics are good. I was asked to play this for my honest feedback and here it is. First this could be one of the best games on quest, at least it has the potential...if more content was added to bring this to at least a 4-6 hour game and the bugs fixed (along with a few other features) this would be fantastic and deserve 5 stars. I want to point out this is in development and on app lab so I understand it is not finished, I want to applaud the developer for all the hard work put into this and encourage to keep it up, you have a masterpiece waiting to be completed here. In it's present state, there are bugs that stop you from completing puzzles and tasks to advance to the next room, once these are fixed the puzzles are the perfect balance, it's not frustrating like myst but it doesn't hold your hand either. It needs a sitting mode, snap turning, and the volume on npc characters need to be louder, a hint system for people that get frustrated easily or simply so everyone can enjoy, and MORE! I wanted more with this game and I highly recommend supporting this game and the developer so that it can become what it is capable of being which is the best escape room game on the quest platform!","Very good escape the Bunker game, sometimes it is a bit glitchy, screen goes black and you can‚Äôt see anything. But apart from that very good experience, make sure that you have enough room to play, I‚Äôve hit my ceiling lights a couple of times, so changed my guardian. I haven‚Äôt completed yet But, Very well done game would recommend trying, you do loose track of time playing as you are immersed in trying to get out. Developers keep up the good work and look forward to seeing more from you. üëç",I have not made it very far into the game yet but it has been a fun game to play. Puzzle games in VR are so much better because you are pulled into the game even more then anything else. I would recommend this game to any one who loves a challenge of figuring out how to get out a locked room situation. The only thing I could say about the game I had a little issue with was sometimes the words would get blurry when looking at the straight on.,"A Puzzle Game with a lot going for it but needs some work multiple times loading the game, I found myself running into small but annoying, and irritating, for example when trying to override the AI Computer I got a code to the emergency elevator but was not able to use the keypad as the logo text was smack in the middle on the keypad I had to restart the level to fix this problem. Even the bugs were somewhat annoying at times Overall the game is very well made and very easy to just pick up and play with self-explanatory Hits If you look around its not super long around 1 Hour but this can seem a lot longer when trying to figure out what to do If you love Puzzle games then don't give this a miss ok a few bugs but in time the developer with fix this with patches and updates I would like to see a DLC add-on later Beyond the Bunker but one step at time. This game really does suck you into full immersion This escape room is not to be missed Many thanks to the Development Team So my thoughts pro's Gameplay is Very Well Made Looks and Feels Good The sound is also very nice Replayability I Think once this has been completed I don't really see a reason to replay again in less a DLC Is added in a future update is this worth buying? Absolutely It's fun and has a bit of novelty I am really enjoying it. cons The game has a few Bugs here and there and I would have liked to have seen a sound effect when falling to my death The Hand Controls can sometimes be hard to Get a grasp on items would I recommend this short answer YES Thank you for giving me the chance to play this amazing game Regards A Player Final Score 8/10"
