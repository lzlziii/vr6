Active Shooter Survival,Active Shooter Survival is an Immersive Training for users to practice how to protect themselves in the event of an active shooter situation. Active Shooter Survival delivers the closest approximation to real-life situations in which multiple highly realistic immersive learning (VR) scenarios trigger the emotions needed to create behavioral change. The human instinct to freeze or follow—exactly the wrong instinct in an active shooter situation—is replaced with response-ready reactions that are then second-nature in a time of crisis.,18+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,"Educational, Simulation",English,21.5.24,InciteVR,inciteVR,https://www.incitevr.com/solutions/safety/active-shooter,"Jun 15, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4068694166508791/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4068694166508791&r=1, https://www.incitevr.com/solutions/safety/privacy-policy",619.0 MB,"With healthcare being a 24 hour business, it's hard to find time to provide this training in a safe space away from patients so that their care is not interrupted. This capability, along with visual aid presentations and a hands-on exercise is just what we needed. Keep developing this and get rid of the small bugs I've found so far.","I can't imagine a better way to learn the steps you should take in an active shooter situation. The experience was more intense that I expected, but it felt accurate and not too graphic. It really drove home exactly what I should do if this ever happens. Everyone should take this training!"
