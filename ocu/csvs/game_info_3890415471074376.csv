LCEVC Demo,"Experience the superior VR video quality made possible by Hybrid Encoding and Decoding with MPEG-5 LCEVC. MPEG-5 ""Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding"" is the latest standard by MPEG and ISO, that extends the compression capability of the base codec (e.g., H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1) while lowering its encoding and decoding complexity. Enjoy this experimental application, watching LCEVC-enhanced ultra high resolution content and toggling between LCEVC (A button) and equivalent streams that just use native video codecs at typical 4K resolution (B button). All content must be downloaded before viewing. Thanks to the Facebook Oculus team for collaborating with V-Nova on this experimental VR application of LCEVC and the Diamond Brothers, PresenZ and Blend Media/All Around Project for providing fantastic 8k60 source content for us to use in the comparison.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Touch (as Gamepad)","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,", Media & Streaming",English,1-prod,V-Nova,V-Nova,https://www.v-nova.com/,"Jun 14, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3890415471074376/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3890415471074376&r=1, https://platform.v-nova.com/terms/oculus_privacy_statement",Terms of Service,13.9 MB,"I was not expecting much to start with, but the quality enhancement is quite obvious and makes the whole experience much more compelling. Knowing that the quality enhancement does not compromise file size or compute is the extra cherry on top of a very good looking cake. Hope this tech takes off soon!"
