Shoot A Goal,"Shoot at the goal with a basketball! There are six different challenges and multiple difficulty levels, and once you complete a certain number you can change the effects on the ball! - Clear the game by putting all the shots on goal within a certain number of shots and within a certain amount of time. - Clear the game if you can shoot the ball into the goal of different sizes by the time limit. - If you can shoot at the goal with a number that matches the formula displayed in front of you, you will clear the game. - Find the goal hidden in the panel and shoot to complete the game. - The game is cleared when the balls hit the cans and all of them drop to the ground. Or, after hitting the ball to the cans, if all the cans are put into the goal, the game is cleared. - Match the panels with the letters of the goal, and clear the game if all panels are erased.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Casual, Sports","English, Japanese",1.0,SimpleOne,SimpleOne,https://github.com/simpleone-vr/Shoot_A_Goal/wiki,"Apr 17, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4969022013177836/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4969022013177836&r=1, https://github.com/simpleone-vr/Shoot_A_Goal/wiki/Privacy-Policy",194.8 MB
