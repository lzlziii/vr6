CHARM VR App,"CHARM is a project co-funded by the COSME Initiative of the European Union, that aims to boost the competitiveness of European tourism and promote the image of Europe as a global tourist destination of excellence. CHARM VR App offers to the visitors the possibility to explore in an immersive way a cultural-architectural good from the Italian Pilot Village Cunziria: Palazzo Trao Ventimiglia in Vizzini, Italy. The palace is the headquarter of the Museum of Verga’s imaginary. The VR App has been conceived as a virtual path through the two exhibits of the museum, the first one about the traditional work tools of local tanners and farmers and the second one about Verga’s passion for photography.
