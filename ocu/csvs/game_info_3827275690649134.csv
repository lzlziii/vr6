VRtuos,"Just calibrate your real piano and press play! Notes will fall directly onto your keys, so it's really easy to learn how to play any song pretty fast. There are many songs included, but you can also import your own .mid files. You can also connect your midi piano using the Companion app from https://vrtuos.eu. If you do that, you will unlock two more modes and you will see keys press down.",3+,Single User,Sitting,"Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Art/Creativity, Educational, Music","English, Czech, French (France), German, Russian, Swedish",2.0.9b,Pavel Marceluch,Pavel Marceluch,https://vrtuos.eu/,"Mar 19, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3827275690649134/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3827275690649134&r=1, https://vrtuos.eu/PrivacyPolicy.txt",Terms of Service,248.7 MB,"1) When playing without real piano, it has no sounds. (Unlike other vr piano programs like PianoVision or MagicKeys). 2) When I have auto-switch btw controller and handtracking enabled, and started this program, it didn't recognize when I put down the controller (which otherwise works). But I also can't start in hand only mode, as calibrating the piano requires the controller (unlike other mentioned programs where you can use your fingers). So I have to calibrate with controller, then go back to main menu and enable hand then back here... 3) Can't setup my small 26key synth here. Even with the universal calibration, there will be one key length difference in two octaves. Ie if C3 is in good position, C1 will be off by one key. That's pretty bad.","So if there's a setting if you don't have a piano, then why is it not working with hand tracking or sound? I don't have a piano, but I would like to learn. Why can't you have hand tracking on the keyboard that's on the screen?","Is possible in setup to change number of keys ? Because I use iRig 37 whats usb keyboard with 37 keys, size calibration work but on wrong number of keys ... I have got bigger keyboard but for space reason I can't use :(",When I bought it I can’t even hear anything my oculus was Burning up￼ and I checked my Volume￼ and it was full but I thought it was just my oculus I thought something happened to it but when to go to a different game I can hear I will not recommend this,I'd like to enable passthrough using this so i can see my hands. It is much MUCH better than looking at a virtual piano. PLEASE take this into consideration!!
