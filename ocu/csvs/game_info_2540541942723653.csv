HouseFlipper VR,"Changes, changes, changes! We have ensured that House Flipper VR brings a unique experience, no matter if you ever tried virtual renovations. The veterans will definitely notice some items they have never seen before as well as a new graphic design. But all this is just the tip of the iceberg. The biggest revolution is in the gameplay itself. We have completely redefined all the mechanics: from now on you are not getting rid of all the dirt from the counter with a single click - swing that virtual brush yourself!",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale, Sitting","Touch (as Gamepad), Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Casual, RPG (Role Playing Games), Simulation","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), Czech, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish (Spain), Turkish",9.5,Frozen District,Frozen District,http://www.houseflippergame.com/,"Aug 27, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2540541942723653/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2540541942723653&r=1, https://frozendistrict.com/privacy-policy.html",396.4 MB,"I was enjoying the game until this chapter. Stuck and can’t move on. Job is to kill roaches, find toy, add radiators to room, spackle walls, and paint them pink. I killed roaches, found toy, and picked up tool to spackle walls, installed 2 radiators, I did all the walls ‘white’ with tool, bought the pink paint, painted all walls in room pink, and task for wall repair was at 0%. You need to be at least 75% done job to move on, but with the wall repair and paint not being registered at all, I’m stuck at around 60% of job total and can’t move forward?? Just stuck here…..I’ve uninstalled the game and played to this job with same results. I saw on an online forum that another had exact same issue. If devs could let me know if I’m doing something wrong, or update for this glitch I would appreciate it. Otherwise I’m requesting a refund as I can not progress forward with game. As far as game itself it is a bit annoying to reach to grab tool and a cabinet moves instead and it never goes back properly. I like to move like other games and not teleport as thats strange. A little more rehab of house and less cleaning, but game is good to just chill. So please fix the glitch or advise how to bypass and move forward.. TIA",This game is not like the original House flipper and is honestly such a waste of my money. It doesn’t have a lot of the features that the other game has and is not updated frequently.,"Most of what you do is clean the houses and not renovate them at all. I should have listened to the reviews and not bought this game. Maybe it gets better later, but I don’t want to go through all the boredom to find out.",Want to save 25 use this link below bio link/z7xnrbhh Remove space and put (.),"Don’t get me wrong I do love playing this game from time to time, but I wish it had the features that the original game had, building new walls, being able to do garden work. Interiors design is fun and cleaning is all right but I wish there was more to this game"
