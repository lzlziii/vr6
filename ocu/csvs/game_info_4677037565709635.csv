I imported a 360-degree 3D image of a skybox, including a music file, and the experience is terrific, totally immersive. Great work done by the developers. Congratulations!","I've finally subscribed to the payng full version of Immergalley, all the more so as, as a new comer in metaquest the credit was offered by Meta as a welcome gift. I absolutely don't regret this subscription. This application is simple and astounding. It allows me to look at my pictures and see my characters in real size. I can listen also to some musical backround. I can even look at my own appartment with the special option of passthrought camera. And then all objects appear as if they were drawn with a white line. Every time I have a question I can write to the developpers who answer me nearly the same day. I feel a great gratitude for their advice and attentions and of course for their application.","I'm using this to showcase my 360 stereoscopic renderings from Lumion to clients/users and it works wonderfully, including easily moving from one image to the next. I searched for days among outdated apps and overpriced packages before I found this gem. I can't believe there aren't more like it that actually works.","I purchased the ImmerVR app a couple of months ago to use as a viewer for 360 drone photos, 3d 360 photos, and smaller format 3d photos I've shot over the years. Its really a treat to be able to view pictures in the large VR format. Too much fun! Its breathing new life into old hobbies! The app is pretty straight forward for basic use. Photos are simply loaded into folders on the app, which recognizes different image formats and plays them back properly. ImmerVR has quite a number of really cool features for designing slide shows with voice over narration, music, maps, and really interesting added visual and audio effects which create a very immersive experience. I'm currently learning to use these tools on a project. ImmerGallery has a tool on their website which guides you through the customization steps if you're wanting the ultimate slide show, but many features can be added on the fly within the app if that more suits your needs.. Additionally, I am very impressed with the responsiveness of ImmerGallery. I had a couple of small questions which I emailed about, and both were resolved by Daniel immediately. Thanks for the great app!! Dave Snow","After playing with the demo version for some time, I knew I had to buy the full version. And it really exceeded my expectations. What a great app! Well thought out, with the eyes of developers that know what they are doing to suit photographers of all levels. An extra compliment has to be made to the developers for their quick, extensive, and very helpful responses. The app will be developed further, and I'm sure lots of great features will be added, taking requests from people that are using the app very seriously. But the app is full of wonderful features already, and the extensive free galleries are great examples of how to make the best pictures in cities and in nature. And I am really triggered to take up 180 or 360 photography because now I have the perfect app to view my photos with."
