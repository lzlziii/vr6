This experience was awesome! Hopefully more music will be added in the future!!!!,Nice demo highlighting the new hands 2.2 update!,This is a great showcase and could be a full game. Developers need to be adding hand tracking if it is this good.,Works fine with v55.,"Really cool idea here. Hand tracking sets it apart from the other games in the exercise genre. Hit register doesn't seem to be very accurate when doing the chop motions - I nail it perfectly every time on the easier difficulty but according to Move Fast I'm missing roughly one out of every three. I'm not. Also, there is a slight but detectable delay between actual hand movement and when it appears in the game. Other than that, this is a nicely designed workout game with a ton of potential. I'm excited to see more."
