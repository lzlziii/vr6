I hugely enjoyed perfecting each level and getting the unlocks. For the right price, the full game will be a definite buy. I only have two suggestions/points of criticism: 1. The pause menu in-level should have a retry/restart button: exiting out back to the tent, picking up the knife, and putting it back in the same place is too many steps when you make a mistake and want to try again. 2. Mix up the background SFX in the levels, or remove/reduce the blacksmith hammering SFX. Every single level ended with that loud tingy hammering in my ear while looking at the rewards, and by the time I was done it was driving me crazy. Other than that, really looking forward to seeing where this goes! Jousting against people online sounds super fun!","The developer clearly understands both the physics of jousting and the feeling of a medieval tournament itself, because this is a really great demo that should lead to an excellent full game! You can see a gameplay video and review I made here: https://youtu.be/nnfo71SqDgI",Great game I think this will be an amazing game when finished that I’m definitely getting,"Awesome jousting game! Man I got some Defender of the Crown nostalgia going on, and it’s Great fun."
