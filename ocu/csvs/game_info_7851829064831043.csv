Bocce Time!,"In Bocce Time! you'll head down to a peaceful park or atmospheric pier to test your bocce skills across 12 distinct courts. Jump into a quick match to 1v1 a random opponent online, create and join private rooms with up to 8 players, or play against AI across 3 difficulties to unlock additional ball customization options. With full cross-play, everyone's invited to join the fun! It's Bocce Time! Bocce ball is an ancient and simple game about getting your balls closest to the target. Players throw out a small ball called a pallino and then up to 4 teams take turns trying to get their balls closest to it, blocking, knocking, and blasting each others' balls in the process. The pallino can land anywhere in bounds and every ball can impact the others, resulting in an ever shifting playing field where the target can change with every throw. It's easy to learn, but difficult to master, and when millimeters can make the difference between defeat and victory, individual skill really shines!",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Casual, Sports",English,"1.3.1

It's about the right price, but I might suggest dropping it a bit when releasing to the main store (definitely release it as you will make grips of cash and get lots more feedback / motivation), to keep the reviews & player base high, then going the DLC route. I played one game against the bot, and here is my initial impression: First, the menu area felt low-res and pixelated, while the arena felt a bit more antialiased and smooth. Not sure what's up with that, but I would suspect some optimization would enable higher resolution (foveating?). This should also be 90 Hz no problem. Second, the bot's voice is obnoxious after awhile. It's ok, but maybe a vocoder effect to make it a bit less like a random midwest dude or having a few characters (there is an option to silence it). I noticed that whenever I threw, the ball went a bit rightward from where I felt my hand was swinging (?), and I couldn't really figure out how to spin it and tried flicking my wrist as I would with a real bocce ball in all different eccentric ways. Turns out you have to enable spin in settings; surprised that isn't the default or part of an introductory set of questions (e.g. handedness, spin preference, avatar, etc). Finally, I'm not sure why, but watching the balls land and interact, it didn't quite feel right. I think this was mostly about the bot's backspin and how it landed; it had some polygon overlap with the floor that looked weird. It's fine, but maybe you could add a bump map and texture that evolves as the balls hit the dirt, making little dents and discoloration? Other than this, the framerate was buttery smooth and I started to correct my throw to get the ball to go more in the direction I wanted (with zero spin, no matter what :). I rarely keep games but I will keep this one, and maybe get it for my friends. Has the friendly feel of walkabout (high compliment!) but will not hold my attention as long. But it's priced to keep and will be a nice change of pace! Feature request: A second ring for the next closest team (counting points) or highlighting point balls somehow?",Five star game all day long!,"Looking forward to a bright future on a new vr game. Good job. Loving the new updates, scoring, boundaries and alternate play. WTG","I use games like this to visit with my kids who live in a different state and we used to play bocce ball in person so it was a no-brainer to get this. The gameplay was excellent and we had a blast. There are several obstacle type courses to make things challenging as well as a very large standard play field and then a large open yard with even more fun obstacles. Thank you devs!! Some ideas for future... I hope you expand. How about a course on the moon with craters and low gravity or one underwater with sea creatures and water currents to navigate and use. A golf course with large rolling hills and sand traps, maybe water hazards.","Multiplayer - check Plain language instructions - check Smooth and responsive - check Lots of variety - check Price point - double check Playability - check Bots that are not annoying - check I've never played bocce IRL - this is fun! Well done, Devs."
