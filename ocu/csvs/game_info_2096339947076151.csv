You have a lot of gameplay and can spend many hours in this game without realizing. Overall, great game with good graphics and I donâ€™t have any criticisms about this game and definitely money well spent. ðŸ¤©If you are thinking to buy this game I got you. Send me a message saying the game name and 25 percent link. ðŸ¤© ðŸ¤©And Iâ€™ll message you the link to give you a nice 25 percent off the game!!! ðŸ˜Š","The game is broken, it rotates my character in circles when I didnâ€™t press the button so Iâ€™m just spinning around and canâ€™t cast any spell and they wonâ€™t except a refund, complete waste of 20$","When I first bought this game years ago, I thought it would be a hit. The idea of being able to be a Wizard in VR was absolutely outstanding to me. At first it relatively was nice but you could barely get in matches with players. That was 2 years ago and now the game is completely dead. I tried again recently to see if anyone still did the 1v1s and not a single person was online. The developers have also chose to abandon the game and it has been left for scraps. It was a great concept but poorly advertised and executed.","This game has a variety of techniques to use to beat your opponent. Although easy to learn, this game is quite difficult to master. I suggest giving it a shot!",It gets boring really quick and some things in the game are to op and if your EXTREMELY competitive then you may like it but itâ€™s only limited stuff and no friends feature and itâ€™s only 1v1s Also I wish I knew you werenâ€™t able to move around freely. You are only able to teleport to certain points. If you were able to move around with a joystick in areas with teams or friends that would be 10 times better and would be more fun.
