I’m hoping the Developers haven’t given up on this game. A couple issues I have and I’m not sure if I am overlooking something. 1). When I want to go in to just play a few rounds, I can’t go out unless I have lost the game, which can be after many levels. The only way I can see how to get out is to quit. I’d rather go back out to the main screen. 2.) I have played all 150 levels and want to replay again. There isn’t any way to clear it out and restart a new game. I tried deleting the app and re-installing it, but that didn’t work. I had to set the level to hard and lose every game, which was extremely time consuming. Please correct me if I’m not seeing how to fix those issues. If it’s my error I will definitely change the rating to 5 stars. I would pay to have some different card back (and front) selections and more levels. I haven’t figured out how to add music, mainly because I can’t figure out how to bring it into the Quest. Others make it seem easy. 🤔 The music playing is somewhat calming and the room setting is nice. I like the effects when you win or lose a game. 👏🏼 I agree with others on the table being too low. I have tried everything in the Quest to try to bring it higher. Having neck issues, it’s painful after a few minutes to have to look down so I have to stop. Other than that, Kudos! 🙂",I absolutely love this game! It’s calming after a long day! It’s almost like solitaire,"After a long day of tons of thinking and brainstorming for my job, this is my go-to game. It’s relaxing. It’s light. And it just works. I can have my music playing in the background. I just wish that the developers could let players adjust their own card height and table height. Currently, it’s a little too low for my liking. Otherwise, it’s a really great relaxing game.￼￼",It's a solitaire style game that surrounds you as you play. Slightly different than your average solitaire game.,"I love spending time on this app ,it's so chilled out but would love to add my own music to it ,that said it's still worth a solid 5 stars"
