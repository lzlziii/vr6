The music and the vibes of the environments just hit different but in the right way. The gameplay is also amazing.I hope they keep updating this game going forward. I recommend this game highly to anyone looking for a zombie shooter game. Itâ€™s better with friends as well. I hope they are working on more content because itâ€™s needed,"After the fall is a game where the world is infected with a virus for a, like frost zombie. Starting with the storyâ€¦ there really isnâ€™t a story aside from a few missions from the main lady in the hub. I find this to be nice actually, because after the falls gameplay I donâ€™t think is meant for a story so, story out of five stars 3/5 Next is the gameplay which is just the shooting from Arizona sunshine but better, if you havenâ€™t played Arizona sunshine this just means the shooting is really good and all the guns are good to use too. All of the guns you can make an argument to use (aside from the service pistol) Guns and gameplay 5/5 And the AI is pretty good as well, itâ€™s not amazing but itâ€™s not supposed to be amazing their just supposed to run at you and try to hit you. The enemy Varietyï¿¼ is pretty good, most of the time itâ€™s just hordes of normal enemyâ€™s but sometimes you get special enemyâ€™s which are chargers, big tanks of enemyâ€™s that will run at you, eaters which are big enemyâ€™s that when you shoot them enough they explode and hit other enemyâ€™s around you (including you), then thereâ€™s brutes which run at you and hit you and do a lot of damage, and finally thereâ€™s the juggernaut which just is a bullet sponge and will Walk Towardsï¿¼ you and hit you or pick you up and will Inflictï¿¼ massive damage. And the difficulty is pretty well balanced as well, first you have recruit (easy), veteran (normal), master (hard), nightmare (very hard), and then horror which I donâ€™t know what to call it because for me itâ€™s unplayable, I normally play up to nightmare and itâ€™s a balanced difficulty. Difficulty 5/5, AI 4/5, enemy variety 5/5 This is subjective but my total score is 21/25 really great game especially with friends would most definitely recommend.","At the age of 49, I finally found my self being interested in something related to a computer game ðŸ™ˆ Purchasing a quest 2 was the best thing I have done! My brother bought me this game 6 months ago because he wanted to play it with someone he knew. Iâ€™ve never fancied shooting games but something really got me hooked. Iâ€™m totally addicted and just love to play with people all over the world. Especially when they comunicate and we can talk about strategies. By now Iâ€™ve got a fair collection of games but this is my favorite - no doubt about it!!","Hey trying to help out you guys, I was having the waiting on players problem, what I found out to be the issue was limited free space in the headset I uninstalled a bunch of games that I really wasn't going to play again, and everything corrected itself, and nowadays you can uninstall from the headset as well as delete all the data as well, like for those beginner games that you'll never play again","I LOVE THIS GAME! i say this even tho im not the best or have the best gun in the game, i just enjoy playing this with friends but i feel like the game is lacking in content. I believe just adding another level/stage isnt going to cut it, i need more so if u can add more content i would be more than happy to continue to play your game"
