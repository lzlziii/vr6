Subscriptions such as Supernatural and Fit XR gets boring fast. Thanks developers for such a novel concept. The jumping jacks need better detection but other than that, as a fitness guy, I LOVE IT! Keeps you engaged without realizing you are working out. Well worth the price! Imo, this is just as fun and the physical workload even more than games such as Beatsaber or Ragnorak due to the squats. Bravo developers. Keep it up. (I'm not paid to write this review haha)","This game is great and a very enjoyable exercise. However, the problem is that it often does not detect jumping jacks operations. I hope to improve them.",This game is pretty fun given the price. But it's so close to being fun even regardless of the price that I hope they continue to improve it. The detection works and is playable but frustrating if you're trying to be competitive. It's probably just me being lazy with my squats. But hard to tell where it actually triggers a move. One thing I really like is the one minute competitive mode with leaderboard. Quick to play and really addictive.,"With COVID and all, I have been playing many VR games for fitness purposes. Audio Trip, Beat Saber, Fit XR to name a few. FITRIS VR has been a great way for me to get the blood flowing, break a sweat, and get a proper leg workout! no more skipping leg day ;) It’s a very simple, yet weirdly addictive Tetris-type game where you control the blocks with moves like punches, squats, and jumping jacks. I have been doing 50, 80, 100+ squats per game and it has been a great way to entertain myself while working out my lower body which i used to hate (I’m sure others will agree) I know this is an applab app, and well worth the $3, but if I were to make some suggestions, here are some things that I would like to see from FITRIS VR in the future. ・Leaderboards (personal and global) ・historical workout stats ・some sort of multiplayer setup ・other fitness move combinations to control the blocks Looking forward to seeing updates in the future! (my legs are so sore right now)","Good idea, but I found sometimes the block doesn't rotate when I'm doing squats or doesn't respond to jumping jacks. At one point one of my fists disappeared and I couldn't move the block right. I am either doing the moves wrong or the game needs updating to fix the problem."
