Not For Broadcast,"Get ready to run the National Nightly News in Not For Broadcast VR! A nation tunes in, and you get to decide what‚Äôs fit for broadcast. Pick the most exciting (or scandalous) camera angles, bleep the swears and determine which ads to run to keep the sponsors happy. No pressure, right? I mean, who pays attention to the news anyway? The award-winning darkly comedic game of televised chaos that critics have called a ‚ÄúBizarre masterpiece‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuite possibly the best FMV game ever""! Not For Broadcast VR takes the gameplay, story, and gripping dark comedy of the original award-winning FMV adventure and brings you closer to the news than ever. *Frame the picture (and the debate)* Keep the general public entertained with your editing skills. *Keep it PG* Smash that big red CENSOR button to keep rude words (and other sensitive information) off the air. Keep the news safe for children and oppressive political regimes alike. *Hand-pick the headlines* There‚Äôs more news to see than a single broadcast can possibly contain, so someone (that‚Äôs you) gets to choose what goes on air. *Cue the ads* Powerful as you are, they‚Äôre really not paying you enough here. Some hand-picked (if slightly sketchy) sponsors might help pad that bank balance, and provide some laughs along the way. *The show must go on!* Nothing will stop the National Nightly News, not even existential threats! Keep broadcasting no matter how bizarre things get. News stops for no-one, not even a category 5 storm!",18+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Interactive Story, Simulation","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Spain)",1.8.1275,"NotGames, Babaroga",tinyBuild,https://www.tinybuild.com/,"Mar 23, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4913951145319249/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4913951145319249&r=1, https://www.tinybuild.com/privacy-policy",15.27 GB,"Never heard of this game before, and watching the trailers I thought this game was a bit weird. Thank god I bought it though. Surprisingly very fast game to learn when there‚Äôs so much buttons and controls. And it‚Äôs a great hilarious and dark story. I actually bought the PC version too to experience the game better because my eyes usually hurting when I look at something for too long. I only played halfway through the VR version so far, but I can definitely say it‚Äôs more immersive than the PC Version.",This game is great! The interference controls are a little wonky but other than that it‚Äôs great!

If loaded on a secondary account it crashes at the loading screen after selecting difficulty. This may be the cause of the crashes many people are experiencing. I bought this game from my partner to play on the secondary account and she can't play it. If developers fix this I will change my review to five stars. UPDATE: The developers have fixed the crash on loading problem. This game should run smoothly for everyone now. Well done developers for responding. FIVE STARS!!!
