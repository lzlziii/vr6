The quest even more so, just for the standalone aspects. I have been using this game on a daily basis during lunch breaks to work out and I can’t imagine going without it anymore. During the pandemic, I committed to weightloss goals and health improvement plans. I confidently account this game, the variety of music and dev support, as major contributors to my losing 135 over two years. Dietary changes also helped, but the energy and willingness to express myself because of this game have had the largest impact on my self worth and confidence. Can’t stop, won’t stop playing.",Basically magic. This became my primary means of physical therapy after my insurance company decided I had more than my share of coverage for a major spinal injury. My brain is once again able to register where my limbs are in 3D space thanks in large part to this app. I keep playing it because it is maybe the most fun I've ever had playing a video game and also exercising. Works brilliantly as a turn-based game for in person socializing as well; this is a go-to when I try to sell the concept of VR to the uninitiated,"I got my Quest 2 solely for fitness, and while I have dedicated fitness apps, I also like playing fun games that are active and have fitness benefits. Synth Riders is one of those. This is always the very first game I play when getting on my headset every day. It’s my warmup, and it gets me sweating! There are several levels of play to master, and a lot of options to make play easier or more challenging. The game is updated more than any other game I play, and the Experiences are amazing visual treats. Plus, they make it possible to download hundreds of maps onto your headset for limitless variety. Love this game. Five stars all the way!",I'm going to start by saying I was extremely in love with beat saber and thought it was so good... Until I got the chance to try this game and wow the music is way better customizing songs is way easier and I'm way better at this game.. visuals are great and gameplay smooth. Gets harder as you progress obviously. But I have most fun playing master with at least 4 Modifiers on . Makes it way more difficult. But custom songs are where it's at. Love this game,"This is a super fun and addictive game! I am a big fan of synthwave music because it evokes the nostalgia of 1980s pop culture, such as 80s movies or video games. I love the great selection of synthwave music in this game and the environments are very immersive. Thank you developers for developing this awesome game!"
