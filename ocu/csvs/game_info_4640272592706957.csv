The game is simple to understand, has lots of fun features, and is perfect for playing with friends. My only problem is that the online play can be a little dodgy occasionally, but other than that, great game.","Amazing game gorilla tag mixed with a shooter which I’ve been waiting for a long time for that I from this game, so great game five stars love it","This game has to be one of the best games I have ever played. It’s a mix of gorilla tag, echo vr, and a shooter game! 50/10"
