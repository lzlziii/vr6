I don’t have space where my computer is anymore, so I haven’t been able to play in over a year. I just discovered this today and couldn’t be happier! This is amazing that it’s free. It’s nearly all the same stuff as sense arena, but free! This is perfect for training, and no more computer. Just what I needed, thank you so much.",My absolute favorite game! It is a great workout and you will break a sweat. The challenges are super fun and there is enough variety to keep you coming back. I would love if they added a gameplay where you’re actually in a game! The breakaways are really fun but get a little old so an actual game would be so amazing!!,"My game wont load. Its stuck on the title screen and all it says is ""loading, please wait, [STATUS!] ACCOUNT VALIDATION FOR MC-FLEIRY"" Anyone know how to fix it?",I think the other star that it’s missing is because of one game mode they need to add and that’s where you get to be a goalie in a game and not just challenges. A career mode would be awesome to and that would get u guys that 5 star everything else is great
