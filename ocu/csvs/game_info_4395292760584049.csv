Moss: Book II,"Winner of The Game Awards' ""Best VR/AR Game,"" the VR Awards' ""VR Game of the Year,"" and so many more! Quill is back‚Äîand she‚Äôs being hunted. Those who seek to unmake this world are desperate for the Glass she holds, and they‚Äôll stop at nothing to claw it from her grasp. But the young hero has a plan of her own, one that could finally end the merciless rule of the Arcane and restore peace to Moss once more. To stand a chance, Quill will need a true partner by her side‚Äîand we hope that partner is you. With her, you‚Äôll venture deep inside the hexed castle of the Arcane where dangerous terrain, challenging puzzles, and enemies twisted in fire and steel await. The journey will be trying‚Äîfilled with triumph and heartbreak alike‚Äîbut new allies, old friends, and the very nature of the castle itself can offer help along the way. Yet in the end, it is you alone who can lift Quill up to save this world, and together, rise to legend.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Puzzle","English, Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Taiwan), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Mexico), Swedish",1.0.3.91028,Polyarc,Polyarc,https://www.polyarcgames.com/,"Jul 21, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4395292760584049/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4395292760584049&r=1, https://www.polyarcgames.com/privacy",Terms of Service,5.02 GB,"I bought and played through Moss 1 and thought it was brilliant. It's nice to have a game where you aren't in 1st person. I much prefer 3rd person, esp in VR with zero motion sickness. The environments are incredible in these games and the sequel ramps it up a level. The Quest needs more platform games like these I cant understand why there aren't more! Rich in story and character the sequel does not disappoint, plus you get to play as a different character which was a great surprise. All new features and enemies keep the player engaged. Some really cool weapons too! The boss battles are epic and I just love the Moss world. The only thing I'm not too keen on, and this is minor is the narrators voice. I do like sitting at the table between levels and looking at the story but an option to read instead of listen would be better. But like I said just minor. You certainly get your monies worth as there's alot of levels and secrets to find, second time around. I really hope there will be a Moss 3 and if you are on the fence with Moss, trust me...just go buy both. Esp the sequel. We need more Quest platform games as it's being overrun with cheap FPS.","I currently own well over 150 Quest games. If you are considering purchasing this game (or others on Quest) click on my pic and then ‚Äúchat‚Äù to DM me as I can help reduce the price you pay. (See the end of my review for more help). OMG this is such a delightful game and is the sequel to the original Moss. The graphics are superb. The story is lovely and engaging. The controls are a joy and easy to learn. And the whole game will keep you entertained for weeks. The game features a little mouse called Quill ‚Äì don‚Äôt be put off that it is a mouse (those of you who think this is just for kids) ‚Äì it‚Äôs a great little mouse! Quill basically has to puzzle, fight, jump, climb, evade and generally do everything possible to get through all the sections. The game starts you off gently and introduces the different skills you will need to ensure that Quill says safe and does not die. Believe me, you will die a number of times. And some of the puzzles are nicely complicated ‚Äì not too complicated that you get frustrated but not too easy to be boring. This game is so enchanting in the right sort of way. You actually want to help Quill stay safe and, even though Quill does not speak, she makes it clear when needing your help or if you are stumbling with which direction to go. I have played the whole game through twice and enjoyed it just as much the second time. I even played this in single player mode whilst in a party with a friend who was also playing single mode ‚Äì we created a kind of co-op playing the same game at the same time but not seeing each other‚Äôs screens. It‚Äôs one of those games you can keep coming back to! I also recommend the original Moss game, which started Quill‚Äôs journey with equally beautiful scenes and graphics. I hope you enjoyed my review ‚Äì considering clicking the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù button! üëç All my links can also be found on l i n k t r . e e / b l i s s 2 1 2 1 (just remove all the spaces).","Wow, I immensely loved the 1st game so starting this one was bitter/sweet. Excited to play but knew there wasn't Moss 3 yet. I really enjoyed the switching of characters so I got to make a new friend. (Spoiler) I was so upset about Uncle! I am literally horrible at fighting games but these 2 games were so beautiful and fun that it was worth the million times I kept dying an re-trying to get past the bad creatures. I really really can't wait for Moss 3 if it's coming. From all the different games I've played so far, these Moss games are the best by far! Great job to the makers of the qorld and characters. And of course, the story!","While I still absolutely recommend the original Moss, it‚Äôs true that this sequel is just better in every way: 1. Campaign length is around 6 hours while the predecessor goes to 3-4 hours. 2. The graphics are better and more textualized but honestly‚Ä¶not by much, at least for me. 3. The story explodes from the rudimentary first half to the second half. 4. You play an additional character with amazing acrobatic skills and a new flying disc weapon. 5. It does seem you have to backtrack a lot in this one for different (now opened) areas and for the collectibles. These are just some examples to point out. But it‚Äôs really the same as the first one but with the exceptions I‚Äôve listed. I hope this is not spamming you as it‚Äôs on the bottom of the review, but should you find this helpful, please consider using my lnk below. Thank you! üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚úåÔ∏è it‚Äôs %25 off.

Protecting that tiny mouse at all costs and saving the world, only to be rewarded with stained glass windows and the smallest high-fives was certainly an adventure. What I will say against it, major spoiler warning, is that the five Glasses never come into play as anything other than a MacGuffin. They're supposed to bestow abilities to the Reader, but we never find out what they're supposed to be. Quill holds and uses several different Glasses over the course of the game, but that never changes your interaction with the world. I thought that's how they work?"
