There is nothing in the world more fun then yelling “BLUE 42”, chucking a 50 yard wheel route and then dancing on the dude you just made your son. Best football game on quest by far.","This game is amazing blend of simple strategic gameplay and skill based gameplay. Being able to draw up plays and see them work gives a whole new level of satisfaction. That being said, I do wish the si was a little better. Sometimes they act like real people and adapt to your play calling, make good plays, and make mistakes. More often than not though, I will have a wide open td and a linebacker gets pushed 80 mph at me. I don’t know if it can happen, but I just want to be able to score a td without having to worry about the AI being mega boosted to stop me.","This game is great for any football fan to play and enjoy the mechanics and crowd cheering you on while you run to get the game winning touchdown! 2MD beats NFL pro era in my opinion because it has the option to play as the wide receiver, which is very fun. You can also throw field goals in this game. If you’re worried it might be too easy, think again. There is 7+ difficulties, and anything past hard, I can barely even get a touchdown on (I play football in real life so I know what to do). There is a lot of settings to choose from to optimize your experience playing this game. You can also practice throwing, field goals, catching, and more!","So I got this thinking it was going to be bad, knowing that the plays that I just got a 94 yard touchdown on was my play! I love that you make your own plays and Stiff arming Is good as advertised￼. My sister had no idea what I was doing on Christmas in her living room. Awesome game I definitely recommend it if you’re into football￼￼ have a good day/night! Ps. It would be hard but can we get a Multiplayer?￼","I love this game, I would consider it one of, if not my favorite vr game. Fluid motions, fun physics, and you can even become a WR after throwing the ball. One thing I did hope is that 1. As a reciever is with you could catch the football in the air with both hands at the same time, instead of only catching it with one. 2. I wish there was a jump button for wide recievers too. It would allow for some epic moments and being able to catch slightly overthrown balls. 3. Also it would be nice if it was slightly harder to catch the ball. I just find it way too easy to catch the ball and it would just be nice if the hardest difficulties were a bit harder"
