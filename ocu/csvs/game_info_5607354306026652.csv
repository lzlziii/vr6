Wallball,"Wallball is a new, fast-paced VR racket sports game where your goal is to hit the ball with your racket past your opponent into the goal while preventing them from hitting the ball past you for a goal. Not quite tennis. Not quite ping pong. Not quite racketball. Wallball will have your heart pumping as your opponent smashes the ball off all four walls trying to put it past you to score points. Are you up to the task to defend your goal and hit the ball back past your opponent into their goal? Get ready for a workout! Matches are best-of-3 sets. Each set is played to 11 points and you must win each set by at least two points. Sweat your way through all 40 opponents starting with Joker’s Wild and ending with the diabolical Murder Hornet. See how long of a streak you can reach on the Rally Streak game. Getting to 10 isn’t too tough. But 100? Now that’s a challenge! Customize opponents to slow down the speed or to play at blazing-fast speeds. Four levels of opponent difficulty offer an experience for everyone, from a racket sports beginner to a seasoned tennis or ping pong pro.",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Sports",English,"1.0.0

Makes it easy just to jump straight in and play. The game itself has a lot of promise and at its best is a fast paced exciting experience where you need sharp reflexes. Physics are good and there ar lots of opportunities for the dev to play around with things to finetune even more and perhaps offer even more games including multiplayer.,"Talk about your 80s nostalgia game right here. Pong meets Tron in a fast paced game that will get you sweating in no time. Really enjoyed the competition as you move to better opponents and learn new strategies. My 8 year old son even enjoyed competing in this fun game! Definitely worth the buy, especially for anyone wanting to enjoy an old school retro game.","Simple game (in a good way) and a lot of fun. More importantly, I am an avid pickleball player (4.0 level) and this is great training for my kitchen volley game and improving reaction time.",This is one of those gems you find in AppLab. It is a racket ball type game that really is a workout. It will be great to see this game develop further. Love it.,Very fun game that gives you a good workout if you keep at it. Feels kinda like ping pong meets soccer. I'm looking forward to seeing the updates as the game evolves.
