Death By Tomato,"In this VR only game you try to avoid getting hit by Tomatoes and other food. Cats might also be thrown at you. You can slice food being thrown at you or you can catch it, but if you slice a cat you loose a lot of health points. If you catch a Cat you get all your health back. There are 5 difficulties with 5 unlockable weapons and 10 levels with music.",7+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Casual, Food",English,3.0,Benjamin J Wise DBA -Frisky Fox Studio,Benjamin J Wise,https://www.privacypolicies.com/live/737a9c99-e000-43dc-b8bb-4fbd0e9e25c5,"Mar 4, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4571703246283310/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4571703246283310&r=1, https://www.privacypolicies.com/live/737a9c99-e000-43dc-b8bb-4fbd0e9e25c5",728.7 MB,The thought that was put into Death By Tomato is very innovative. Simple but still such a fantastic game! The fun never ends and I can play continuously! Catching the cats are something really fun and NEW to insure you gain your health back up! Love each design of the levels. That as well is very different and the catchy beats stimulates adrenaline. Love love love!
