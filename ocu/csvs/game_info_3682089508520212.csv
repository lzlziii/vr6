The story is compelling and had me hooked since the first 5 minutes. I was awed by the textures, physics, and lighting; how did they get this to run so smoothly on quest? Beats me. This is by far one of, if not, the best story games on the oculus store. It took me about 4 or 5 hours to complete. The puzzles are not too complex and not too simple. The combat was surprisingly well polished, I enjoyed ending the lives of those annoying drones. Great job devs! Scratch that, spectacular job. I would highly recommend this game. -TeaSiri","Visually awesome a little better than the original for me, I have played and completed all 3 games, Dark, Red and now Red Matter 2 and found RM2 to be the most fun while solving situation puzzles, some easy and some tricky. Explore, read everything and enjoy the adventure. If you‚Äôve played RM1 then RM2 is a must you will be impressed, some people don‚Äôt like the idea of guns in the game but I thought it adds to the immersion adrenaline rush and gives some action to the play instead of just exploring, anyway good stuff well done Devs and can‚Äôt wait for 3‚Ä¶.. Buy it!!!","After playing the first Red Matter game I was left with so many questions and you pick up right where you left off in Red Matter 2! Visually the game is stunning! And the story line is awesome! The new combat features add SO much to the game! Also, I‚Äôve had no issues between standing Vs sitting‚Ä¶ both feel very natural and immersive!","It was an incredible journey. There's puzzles, stealth, action, platforming and adventure. The game length was pretty decent too. The last fight took me quite a few times to get through, but not much grind besides that. Enough challenge for me. I do wish there would have been more easter eggs. :)","I just recently finished Red Matter and thought it was fantastic, then I started Red Matter 2. In every way they made this sequel better. Graphically astonishing. Physics are awesome. You grab a document to examine it, and it bends and folds. Jet pack and movement are vastly improved. There are items that are throw backs to the original game. Your interaction with this new world has same mechanics as the first game , with a couple new things and better. This game imo, has set the bar for any type of sequel. If you thought Red Matter was fantastic, wait until you step into Red Matter 2."
