The game has a rouge like element to it. Ever time you fail a challenge, you start over on day one. The game mixes up the challenges every time, so you never know what event you are stepping into. The mini games will really test your skills. You will do things from rhythm drum playing, skiing, ax tossing, outrun a giant and much more. You will be tested in all areas of Viking skills. The game has a nice Viking world with great music to immerse you into the game. I felt like I was in a Viking time. If you love mini games, that cover a variety of skills, this game is it. Viking Days is a fun challenging game, that keeps you coming back for more. Check out my preview here: https://youtu.be/5nHBbgVJ8OM","Now….. the gameplay is great and I really enjoyed the mini games on this they were really fun and addictive. Why I gave four stars?……. I want more, I wanted the levels to be longer and to have more variation because IT IS addictive. Now having said that, when you play more days the levels get harder and longer, that is the plus. But i just want it to have more. Put some puzzles in their to figure out, viking beer pong maybe, ship rowing 🚣‍♀️, dragon spearing, dragon flying, sword fighting 🤺, even a fort/tower defence mode. There is a lot this game could have and should have for its full release which will keep people playing. This is one of those games you get out whilst your having people round to get everyone involved and compete against each other. This definitely falls into this category. VR Monkey have a great dev team and I know they will commit and make this better again for sure! Great job so far and I will re-visit this game on the next patch/update that is for sure!! 💯💯💯💯💯💯 Check out the video I did to know more over on YouTube: REALITY ON VR","This game was an absolute blast, tho i wasnt very good at it 😂😂, but witb that i also dont want my skill to reflect a bad review, bc this game has alot of potential and is a great party game!!!",A fun collection of mini games that is great for parties or to introduce people to VR.,"Decent variety of mini games, something you could easily play for 5-10 minutes a day and not get bored of too easily. Very solid experience for the price point, 5/5 must buy"
