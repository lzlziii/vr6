Also, I would like some of the bugs to be fixed. For example is I call a time out at the same time the opposing teams calls a time out the game won’t let me hand off or choose a play and sometimes it won’t let me snap the ball. Thanks also please update the game lol",1. Add different positions 2. Make it so we can catch the kickoff 3. Maybe we can get kicking added and the choice for 2-point conversions for the players to also do. 4.make it so we can play defense as the middle linebacker or even db. 5. Add multiplayer so you can play against your friends.,"I got this game on the 2nd day it was out, so I wasn’t expecting that much because of all the criticism it was getting in the reviews, and while I kinda get the receiver problem, I know it will eventually be fixed because the devs are gonna update this game, we are in 1.0.0 version right now. But I just have to say, this is the greatest game to ever come to quest. For 1, the graphics are AMAZING! I’ve never seen a quest game with better graphics, and 2, the stadiums are one of the best parts of this game! Their so realistic to the point where you actually feel like your in them. The attention to detail for the stadiums is just mind blowing. 3, tackling and catching animations are the best ai animations I’ve ever seen on a Vr game. The realistic animations really make you feel like your there, something that I would’ve thought made a big difference, and 4, the trophy room is AMAZING! It’s so cool how you get trophies as you play and you can even grab them and stuff, and how you get a football of every team every time you beat them, I just find it so cool! The locker room is also so cool! For the last part of this review, I have some suggestions for the devs, 1, please add manual receiver, it’s my number 1 most needed update to this game, because the ai receivers aren’t always very good at catching the ball, and also it would make the game 10x more fun. 2, please add the ability to draw your own plays, there is already a white board and markers, so it would be cool if you could flip the board around or something and draw your own plays. 3, please add the option to go for it on 4th, I hate 3rd down basically being my 4th, If I’m like 1 yard away for touchdown or 1st down, I should be able to go for it and get. 4, add the option for you to make your own teammate’s or rename your teammates so then you can add players who have left the league on your team. My last recommendation is to make it so when you pass the ball to your running back, you become the running back and can run with the ball, or add this as an option. To close off this very long review, I think you should 100% get NFL Pro Era, Highly recommend","Checklist Gameplay ❌i could play forever ❌as good as last nights tomahawk steak ✅super good ❌good ❌meh ❌i could get more entertainment watching paint dry Graphics ❌madden 24 graphics ✅pretty good ❌this was made on microsoft paint ❌madden 1998 Difficulty ❌my 80 yr old grandma could beat it ❌soooo easy ❌i could do this in my sleep ✅kinda hard ❌hard ❌i need to be a current nfl qb the only bad thing is the players are all the same difficulty like let’s say I pass to the worst player in the nfl, they will still catch it as easily as justin jefferson so can the devs please fix that, still a rlly good game so I recommend buying! also thanks for reading this review! ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️","The game is fun, it’s basically a qb sim but some of the decisions the play calling makes is obnoxious. Would like to see options of going for it on a fourth down and inches. The reason I score it low is I’ve been stuck on the game progression before the bye week on season play. I almost got through the entire game when I could review the stats for the game and it crashes. I have to start over and I am tired of playing the same team with no progress. Fix the crashes and the score will improve."
