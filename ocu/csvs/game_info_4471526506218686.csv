Private Agent,"Fire as many bullets as you can! Private Agent"" is a VR gun shooting game . You can switch between various weapons and aim to conquer stage bosses. The player is asked to destroy the criminal organization Echidna and confront the organization. When you run out of ammunition, you can discard the entire weapon and take out a new one with the AR armory system, so there is no need to reload or perform other difficult operations. Some weapons can be held in both hands, so you can use two pistols for a barrage or a handgun and knife for a CQC style fight.
