Get the code on my telephone but its not working. Pitty, payed also for credits.","This is a great fitness app! You can build your own workouts with your own music and it gets you sweating for sure! Two things that could make it better. 1. It is a bit glitchy. Once you set your height it won't let you set it again. This is very frustrating because now I can't reach the high markers. 2. The 2 player option is fantastic but I spent some time making a workout for me and a friend and then when I went to play it, it doesn't use the workout I created. It would be way more fun to be able to create workouts for friends.","This has to be one of the better fitness apps to get your blood flowing, it has great music, great effects, and a lot of potentials. I like that you can add your own songs and then different routines to that song. But there are some things that need attention. Like after completing a song there is a page that breaks down calories burned and accuracy but no matter what, it always says 200 for each one. Another thing, can't play the tutorial, but it's pretty easy to figure out. Then when you create a song there is an option to send it to the store where other users can try it, but it never downloads to the store even know it said it has. Even with these issues, it's still a good fitness app. Fix these things and it would be a great app...","30 minutes initial review: - Tutorial bug: doesn't launch from the profile - Did all the workouts on slow instead of medium or fast and I was sweating like crazy - Would be awesome to add kicking if it was possible For a game in development, I still like it and plan on using it regularly when I get a chance.","I finally was able to create an account after several tries - unresponsive fields - it would not let me clear the password and re-enter it, and the password requirements were not fully visible in the error message, but finally inâ€¦now, the tutorial will not start, consequently I have no idea what the different types of objects mean. Nothing on the website or online that I can find. It was disappointing because I was enjoying the game, hitting the different colors and types of balls, but when I hit some I was gaining points and when I hit others I was losing points and I had no idea why, or what I should have been doing. Awesome music though!"
