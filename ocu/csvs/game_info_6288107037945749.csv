Fine I’ll give you games Here’s the games Gibbon monkeys Gibbon madness It’s all the games I know Please stop scrolling down Welcome to Ohio It’s 3 AM already I suspect you should lock your doors 💀💀😭😭","Please stop rating the game 1 star only because you cant get into a server or the game is on lockdown. It puts a bad impression on us and makes people think this game is bad when in reality Shrek spent so much time on this game, and it's one of the best Gorilla Tag horror fan games on the market. I'm not saying to rate it 5 stars, you can still rate it 1 star, but only if you actually have a good reason like the level design is bad, or the game isn't enjoyable. Thank you!","So the game is very very fun and good and then I checked out all the maps and the horror I got to level 9 and then I had to sleep so I got off and then the next day I met shrek! Please make me mod if you can or join code A for me to beg XD so shrek, can I have mod pleaseI'll be good and I'll ban or kick toxic players or hackers and never let you down.

(This message is long) The game is so fun I like the game so much but there is a few problems we should talk about. (ISSUE 1)- Whenever you join the game or a server you can’t hear people, but a few people actually can! I played this game yesterday with my friends I could hear ALL players and things. But after tomorrow I hop on the game I couldn’t hear anyone. (ISSUE 2)- Sometimes I play the monsters freeze for a few seconds or even minutes. Also make the jumpscares look scarrier and add more blood textures so it would be more funnier and scarrier. (NOTES)- Make it harder to escape levels like add more monsters to the game and add mute buttons to the player’s name so if someone would scream you could mute people. Also make more maps and make some monsters blind and they only can hear the steps of the person. Make some prizes to the game to appreciate the people going through all of this scare. If you see this message please make all the things I said it would make this game more popular and fun. (TO MODDERS)- We need more monsters like this on level 5 looking a friendly gorilla and make it transform into a monster! Make banning system more smarter, I saw some people getting banned for no reason I am serious there was no reason to describe the ban. That makes players leave the game forever and call it trash without recommending it to the new players 🗣️ Also when you are making a name please add an “enter” button because I saw players getting banned (NOT MINE)-“someone wanted to write ducky but they added 2 more k’s to the name” and they got banned for that. (EXTRA)- Please understand the reviews of the game and actually fix the bugs! Thank you. -Kiri_plays","This is an amazing game even though I’ve finished all the levels many times I still get scared from the monsters,This game has great quality and great graphics I can tell the game developer really wanted this to be good and not rushed and I have never had this much fun since I got Vr over a year ago! 😁"
