"Please, Don't Touch Anything","Please, Don’t Touch Anything is a cryptic, brain-racking button-pushing puzzle game. Covering for a colleague taking a bathroom break, you find yourself in front of a mysterious console with a green screen monitor showing a pixelated live image of an unknown city. Also present is an ominous red button with the simple instruction to not touch anything! Push the red button once or press it many times. Your choices and actions will lead to outrageous and frightening consequences and over 30 unique puzzle endings. Scavenge the room for clues, tools, and buttons to solve riddles and trigger explosive events. This deceptively simple console has many mind-blowing surprises for you. This updated version of the classic game features all new high-quality visuals, new mechanics, updated classic endings with new solutions, and a slew of new endings. Go ahead, press the button.

This has nice puzzles, ones where your left wondering “What’s Next?”. This game is for people who are new with VR or need a cheap good game! Even if it was 60$ I would still buy it so 10/10 Maybe add a built in guide/hint system where you have hints while loading or in the pause menu. You could have it as a setting in settings, like Hints On/Off (if you add this plz credit me)",Crash Course: Friend goes to the bathroom and tells you not to touch anything obviously you do multiple puzzles leading to different endings around 30 total. Puzzles are unique and have memory based things so write stuff down! This has both a standing and sitting mode and height adjustment in the SETTINGS. (This is in full 3D not the 2D Console/PC version similar but different.) ____________________________________________________________ What I recommend: Writing Paper/Utensil for remembering codes and hints Go in blind personally I watched a lot of videos about the game but going in blind is more exciting. Motion sickness may occur so be prepared for a lack of floor and moving backgrounds. Motion sickness in some endings due to moving floor and lack of floor/legs. ___________________________________________________________ Some minor cons: Controls can be finicky but aren't that bad. Stars of David/2 Satanic and 666 endings but very little gameplay of those things. Horror is very minor but is still there to be prepared for flashing lights and unexpected jump scares. If you have a bad memory you may need to write some things down which takes away from gameplay.,This is one of my favorite games on my VR headset. The puzzles are good and and the game is funny too. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the puzzles can sometimes be too hard. If you don't know something in this game that is required to beat a puzzle then you have to research or look it up online. Other than that this game is really good.,𝙸𝚝 𝚒𝚜 𝚜𝚘 𝚏𝚞𝚗 𝚍𝚎𝚜𝚝𝚛𝚘𝚢𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚙𝚕𝚊𝚗𝚎𝚝 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚊𝚘 𝚖𝚞𝚌𝚑 𝚖𝚘𝚛𝚎 𝙸 𝚠𝚒𝚜𝚑 𝙸 𝚌𝚘𝚞𝚕𝚍 𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝟷𝚖 𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝚘𝚏 𝟻 𝚙𝚕𝚎𝚊𝚜𝚎 𝚖𝚊𝚔𝚎 𝚖𝚘𝚛𝚎 𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎𝚜 𝚠𝚑𝚎𝚗 𝙸 𝚊𝚕𝚖𝚘𝚜𝚝 𝚏𝚒𝚗𝚒𝚜𝚑𝚎𝚍 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎 𝙸 𝚏𝚘𝚞𝚗𝚍 𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚌𝚘𝚞𝚕𝚍 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝚎 𝙸 𝚠𝚊𝚜 𝚒𝚗 𝚂𝙷𝙾𝙲𝙺 𝙱𝚞𝚝 𝙸 𝚠𝚒𝚜𝚑 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚛𝚎 𝚠𝚊𝚜 𝚖𝚘𝚛𝚎 𝚎𝚗𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚐𝚜 𝚜𝚘 𝙸 𝚛𝚎𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚍 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚐𝚎𝚝 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎 𝚒𝚏 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚢𝚘𝚞 𝚍𝚘𝚗'𝚝 𝚠𝚊𝚗𝚝 𝚊𝚗𝚢 𝚏𝚞𝚗 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚛𝚎𝚜𝚝 𝚘𝚏 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚕𝚒𝚏𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚡 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚊𝚗 𝚊𝚖𝚊𝚣𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎 𝙸 𝚠𝚒𝚕𝚕 𝚗𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚛 𝚏𝚘𝚛𝚐𝚎𝚝 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚊𝚖𝚊𝚣𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚟𝚛 𝚐𝚊𝚖𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚡 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚕𝚒𝚜𝚝𝚎𝚗𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚑𝚊𝚟𝚎 𝚊 𝚐𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚝 𝚍𝚊𝚢 𝚋𝚢𝚎
