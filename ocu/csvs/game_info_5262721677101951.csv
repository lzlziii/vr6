Fun to play when I can’t get to the real course. Frustrated by the ball being placed outside my guardian boundary all the time. No way to move it back inside. Otherwise it’s fun.,"I purchased this game as was given a Quest 1, unable to play 18 hole courses on any other golf game. This is fun. I love the way you can change length of club so you don't have to move. Great for playing in tight places. Multiplayer is great, a friend mine purchased game so we can play online. Having a little trouble putting as I don't seem to be able to bring up information on slop etc. Please don't stop full game from working on Q1.","This game seems worth the price , its fun and relaxing , having played golf in reality in enjoy this game alot , how ever id like to see some new courses maybe open field type golf courses, Lobby with npcs hanging around , I'm sure dev is playing to make this game even better and add more content to it , good job dev","I find this game closer physics wise better than it’s competitors. 1. I wish the bankers were better. They kind blend in with the grass, but with a sand texture. I wish they felt and looked like bunkers 2. I wish changing clubs was easier / better … I always worried I am using the wrong clubs 3. There is no way to see putting angles, not like I can bend over and look at the grass. Some minor hints, would be nice.","i believe the positive reviews are from people who arent low handicapers. i can tell you the distance is way off. its over 100 yards short. you dont move the ball forward of back in your stance for trajectory, you simply press a button. the graphics arent the best and the clubs are far from realistic. if you could adjust your distance to your normal game it wouldnt be as bad but when you go from 330 to 200 off the tee, that alone is enough to want to break your oculus. putting and chipping is realistic. outside of that, its far from being considered an accurate golf simulator. it will ruin your golf swing if youre a competition player and you get used to this. id steer clear. for kids and nongolfers who want to see how it feels to play golf, i recommend it. for any players who would use the app for a swing analysis breakdown or different angles of attack, this is not the app for you."
