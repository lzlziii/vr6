Space Portal,"Built by planetary scientists, Space Portal shows you highly accurate real-time views from spacecraft orbiting the Earth, Mars, and the Moon. Each month a new spacecraft orbiting the Earth is featured, while the International Space Station is always available. New missions to the Moon and Mars are added when possible. As you fly above the Moon and Mars you can access information about their geologic features and vehicles that have landed there. On Earth, you can access information about cities and other natural features. A variety of music choices are available. You can also customize your experience by flying without any geographic overlays. You can choose to enlarge the appearance of planets to see their positions in the sky. The lighting you see is perceptually accurate, such that city light, sunlight, and moonlight effects are all generated realistically - just as you would see them if you were really there. In fact, if you fly at night over the Moon or Mars, you will see nothing but darkness. A nightlight is included to help you see what's below. Since Space Portal shows real time views: what you see is exactly what everybody else using the system is seeing. Finally, you can also choose to fly with Carl the Toucan. After all, it can get a bit lonely in space! You gain points every time you feed your animal friend, unlocking new animal friends to join you. *Please note that satellite image resolution over Europe is limited until 2024.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Exploration, Simulation, Space/Universe",English,0.43,Flight Augmented Realities,Flight Augmented Realities,http://www.spaceportalvr.com/,"Dec 2, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4257333741041191/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4257333741041191&r=1, https://www.spaceportalvr.com/privacy-policy",109.4 MB,Beautiful experience that transcends the contours of space and time.,"I found it hard to quit from this game and I spent a couple of relaxing and educational hours within it the first time I tried it. While I was sitting in a chair at home, it felt like I was floating/flying in space and looking down at the Earth or the Moon or Mars from various real orbiting vehicles and what i kept having to remind myself of is that Iâ€™m looking at REAL TIME images that are uploaded to the game every hour or so. And Carl the Toucan is a hoot! i love how he flyies along with me. oh, and while the earth is passing below you, you can see country outines and you can select cities which will then pop up an interesting fact or two about them. i love it!",My friends and I have been really enjoying this! Keep up the great work! Looking forward to seeing where else you go with it.,"kinda what I've been hoping would exist for a while. Takes a minute to load, and the interface is a work in progress, but it's well worth it for this unique experience. You can actually orbit around Mars in what I think is REAL TIME. Really makes you investigate the planet from a whole different perspective. You see pictures like this, but feeling the hover and orbit in space over freaking Mars changes your relationship to planets and outer space, it's a holy experience. Reminds me of the first time I looked through a telescope and saw the moon as a kid - it no longer was a picture, an abstraction, it became real. It's there. Wish it was even higher res. What a trip.",I like it but the planets are a bit too large. I would like to also be able to see stars and galaxies name. And I also like the ability to click on planets/stars/galaxies to see pictures of them and information related to them.
