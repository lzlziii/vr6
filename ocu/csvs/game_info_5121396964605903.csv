Curious, I purchased the game, and found utter disappointment and dissatisfaction throughout my experience, undoubtedly because of the games lack of morals. It continuously harassed my pure strength, critiquing my posture and form, until I gave up and left the game to rot. My experience was terrible, with no smashing to be done. I’m in tears, disappointed at the time wasted here, crying.",The game is still getting updated but it is still good to play it helps for stress and social anxiety I would recommend this game for all ages
