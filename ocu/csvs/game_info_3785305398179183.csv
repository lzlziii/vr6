Quality of picutres could (should?) be better, but it's OK. Out of Google Street, pictures are ok but to limited in moves. Finally, comfort is n't the best: as a regular vr player, i feeled a little bit sick....","Great effort as an alternative to Wander to bring Google Earth VR to the Quest 2. Even though there is still bugs in the program (eg: not able to add fav, and voice dictation is disabled in the search). It's a wonderful app with a GREAT price tag (FREE). ðŸ‘Œ","Great app (while being free), it provides full spherical Google street view and walking wherever you pick. I have few suggestions though: - I wanted to save some locations into favorites to get quick access later. I see there is a 'star' symbol in top right corner of the selection screen and 'Favorites' menu option but they seem to do nothing when activated (tried various combinations without success). Perhaps some help/guide would make sense too. - Movement: glad you provided the option to disable the 'eye-pointing' control but it is still unnecessarily heavy-handed, when one has to point on the arrow to make one step. It would be faster to use a thumb stick to move one step in possible directions and also the option to mark a spot further away and teleport - like in the original Google street view. It gets annoying when one wants to move to a spot 30m away and it is required to travel the distance through step by step. Thanks!",Bad quality,Is this same as wander? If so i dont want to buy wander..
