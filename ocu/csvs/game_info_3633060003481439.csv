Home Plate Baseball,"Home Plate Baseball is a baseball simulator and mini-game collection for VR HMD with motion controllers. Baseball Game: Normal 3 inning baseball game 3 strikes to an out, 3 outs to an inning. If you get four balls you get a walk. Make sure to choose your swings carefully. Score as many runs as you can in three innings. If the ball lands in the infield it's an out, farther from home you'll get more bases. If tied at the end of three innings you'll continue to repeat the last inning. Home Run Derby: You will use the motion controller to swing at pitches to send them to the fences. The pitch will always come to the same location. Catching Game: Catch as many pitches as you can as they come at you. Umpire Simulator: Call balls and strikes, using the trigger and touchpad. Hard mode: Pitches come in much faster, the fastest pitches are over 100 mph.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Shooter, Simulation, Sports",English,5.9,Beep2Bleep,Beep2Bleep,http://beep2bleep.com/,"Apr 8, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3633060003481439/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3633060003481439&r=1, http://beep2bleep.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/privacy-policy",226.1 MB,nice game fun to play has a lot of stuff in it now,Title. Not much more I can say about it since the game is quite literally a main menu and then goes black when you choose anything. Literal trash.,"This game is actually solid. Graphics-2/10 That’s okay tho, keep in mind it is $2.99. Gameplay is what matters. Defense-There is no defense. I wanted to make this clear to potential buyers, but the game doesn’t have to have defense. Instead the other team gets a random number of runs for the inning then you hit again. I have only seen 0 or 1 runs for the easy mode so far. Hitting-5/10 It feels too hard that hits are hard to come by. I’ve played the easy 3 inning mode game twice. It’s extremely satisfying to hit one over the fence, so if contact could be easier this would be rated higher. Contact hits are very very hard to come by. My batting average on this is probably a .040. Yes, hits are hard but I’ve found that half of my hits are home runs. Edit-with practice it’s probably .150 now but contact still needs improvement Modes-10/10 There’s actually a lot of modes. 4 in total (3 inning game easy and hard mode, home run derby easy and hard, umpire simulator easy and hard, and a catcher simulator easy and hard). This has a lot of options for a $3 game. An example showing that this is very good, 2md football has 3 modes with no different difficulties while this has 4 and difficulties. Special Effects-3/10. This is okay, but I would like to see it improve Im a very casual MLB fan, so if you at least have an interest in baseball this deserves at least a try. After reading this review, it seems too critical so just buy and try the game. This could be the groundwork to something great. I’ve always wanted a baseball game so thank you! Must Have Additions Contact needs to be easier","Game just needs outfielders and base running, they should add a season mode with a championship, game and maybe allow you to run to first or the other bases and then it’ll be a 5 star rating and worth every dollar.","Don’t buy, horrible mechanics wont hit ball unless in box, not very fun. And over all not even worth $2.99..."
