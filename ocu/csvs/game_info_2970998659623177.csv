The puzzles don't feel too hard for the most part and some can really annoy the player but I haven't solved a puzzle and felt like ""this is just unfair how the hell was I meant to figure that out."". The only real complaint is that it's only six levels which would take around six hours to beat in total, which isn't good for the price. However every level has six bonus objectives and a Speedrun, all of which are fun to figure out and complete. Those objectives make the levels much more fun to replay and make the 100% of the game around 12 hours long. also completing objectives gives you extra souvenirs and watches which are very cool incentives. If you bought the game i advise you to play the game blind and don't look up walkthroughs on YouTube unless you're completely stuck, it's really fun to figure this stuff out on your own. Overall this is one of my favorite VR experiences of all time and the music in here absolutely slaps.","I came back to this after playing Cog in the Machine, and I forgot how amazing this game is. First off the opening credit sequence will forever be the best no matter how many more are released, the new antagonist John Juniper was an absolutely amazing new character although I wish we got a bit more lore and he didn‚Äôt get killed off, but he definitely brought the entire game together. The levels were incredible as well, after finishing a game there is always that one level that I don‚Äôt like, but in this game none of the levels hit me that way, each one is clever, and challenging, but also fun and entertaining. I will constantly come back to this game not just to play the levels, but to watch that opening credit sequence 1000 times over again",This game is a spy game I needed! It is one of the most perfect and polished game ever. The puzzle are challenging but once you get it you feel so smart. And the little challenges makes it replayable and even more enjoyable. 10/10 game.,"This is a great game for those who like escape rooms, this game needs listening skills and quick problem solving, I would recommend to anyone especially as a first game to show to other people ( 2 5 % o f f) üíéüíØ l i n k t r , ee / c o l e t h e l e g e n d 1 0 2 3 Remove spaces and change , to .","This followed the impressive design/puzzles of the original, and then successfully expanded it even further. Two particular improvements that I appreciated: 1) The villain was actively, visually involved during many of the missions. This made it much more immersive, feeling less like a pure puzzle game and more like a genuine James Bond scenario. The ominous, invisible Zor in the background seems necessary, but Juniper‚Äôs actual presence made it so much more fun. 2) It was so cool that the character actually moves in the game, in spite of the player (and their character) are still stationary. Being lowered into the Fabricator‚Äôs lab, sitting on a moving elevator: things like this are a huge addition without adding any new gameplay mechanics. 3) That intro song and show was classic. It screamed of ‚ÄúCasino Royale‚Äù with both the visual and musical styles. I‚Äôve watched it numerous times simply because it‚Äôs great music. PS - I appreciated some of the funny Easter eggs that appeared. The best was how, during ‚ÄúSafe & Sound‚Äù, you could use the clapperboard üé¨ during the villain‚Äôs monologue, which made the villain frustrated and promptly stomp off üòÜ."
