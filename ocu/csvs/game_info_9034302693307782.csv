So i shoot pistol at 25 meters usally, and think this can help with some practice i real life some what, like mind set, breathing, trigger pull, not like a mushy quest trigger ever gone feel like a real gun trigger but non the less. Pros: Nice gun models. Hit placement on the target is easy to see. Graphics looks good. Fireing sounds Dont take me wrong here but, as of now this feels like pre alfa almost. Cons: Cant turn of music or change volyme. Why can you move around with teleport at all, better to be bound to like a box where you shoot. If you can move, you will try and go places even were you cant, tried the air rifle course and ""walked"" to the door, then the rifle got stuck in the doorway XD... And now to the more important things. Must be able to adjust the guns position in your hand. Choosing between holding grip button or just one press to hold the weapon, or fatigue will set in sooner. Why the need to use both grip and trigger to grip a pellet, i think its a bit fiddley and and takes away concentration from the real goal, aiming and shooting the gun (just my thought). I would even like to see different types of sights, or be able to adjust it to my needs. Different sight posts thickness, the gap for the sightblades (now its to much distance for my likings). Be able to choose to do a 5 shoot series rather then 10. A different colour on the last hit on the score board. I have high hopes for this, because this can be a good shooting tranier not just for air pistol/rifle shooters, but for shooters in general that whant to practice with out the price for real ammo. It is quite a nisch ""game"" trainer thingy but you are on the right track, it just needs more love to be better. Ok so i have ranted enough, sorry for the bad spelling, but english is not my native language.","Early days yet as they say, but quite impressed. I shoot 10m pistol for fun and found this very realistic. Picking up a pellet is a bit sensitive but assume that will improve. I canâ€™t find a way to adjust the sights which would add to the realism. Nice to see the shots on the card to the left of the firing position. If the devs can keep up the good work and progress to field target I would be very happy. Often thought FT would be perfect for vr. Looking forward to what comes next."
