The graphic is simple, but nicely done, so I like it because I came from the old school. The game is very fluid. Just an improvement should change the height of the player, so a person can play in first person sitting on a swing chair. I think that can give a better immersion.",It doesn’t let me play multiplayer but I’m seeing all the good reviews so I’m missing something,"Ok this game was my first purchase that kept me coming back day after day. Granted I also wish the game had more levels, but other than that I have no complaints it was money well spent and I've played many busts I had high hopes for i.e Medal of Honor, any Mech game, any football game👎, Vader Immortal 👎, Iron Man 👎 etc. My only hope is that there is a sequel coming. This WW1 Airplanes, and In Death Unchained and my top 3 of the 90+ games I own.","b i o , l i n k / n o m o r e s a l e Remove all spaces and replace comma with ‘.’ Rate this review helpful If you use it","25 🪙💰🪙💰🪙💰 % off ⬇️ ricardoaos.bio.link The best game, the number one 💪 This game is one of the best virtual reality experiences.
