Well I've just taken a break after almost 4 hours of playing ü§£ü§£ü§£, not that I recommend buying a battery pack so you can play this game that long, but hell yea this is the game I've been waiting for.... This game is absolutely awesome, I'm 47 and I felt like John Spartan from halo, shouting at my kids to get out of the room and kicking the dog while on a killing spree. The developers have created a game which is already amazing, and you can see there's still things being developed which is so exciting. THIS GAME WILL GIVE YOU MORE EXCITEMENT THAN YOUR WIFE DOES The new game slogan right there ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üëçüèª After a few months of playing I can absolutely say this is now the only game I play, it is massively addictive and I'm now at master level üòÇ. The only downside is and would be awesome if they could add a feature where you can friend anyone you've played with online, nothing worse than finding a team you gel with and can't meet up for another mission at a later date, unfortunately it doesn't come up on the recently seen on the quest so you just have to hope you bump into them again. This is just an idea as be awesome if you could create your own dream team of players to a platoon to future sessions. Otherwise I'd give it 10 stars out of 5 haha",I was trying to find something that I really liked since my kids want me to give gaming a try. I‚Äôm 31 and they tried to get me to like call of duty but it never sparked an interest. I bought the game and finally got the hang of it and now they can‚Äôt get me off of it! Lol now I‚Äôm telling them to get off because they‚Äôre making me lag üòÇüòÇ,"A really fun strategic game. Multiplayer makes it even better. Positive: - Graphics are pretty good - Challanging - Good leveling system Negative: - No Crossbuy - Weapon handling could be better (hopefully it will be improved over time by the developer) - Still many bugs included (Some of them, I experienced: falling through the map, weapon does not shoot immediately, not being able to push the button to finish the game) Conclusion: It is a fun and immersive Game. I would recommend to buy it.

I have played some amazing games, but this game‚Ä¶.is the perfect game!! One of my favorite things about this game, you can leave a setting on where people can join your game, and they actually help you. Ôøº YES they actually help you!! I am fairly new at this game, so I am learning the ins and outs. I have had two or three people enter my game and save my azz! Lol. And they‚Äôve given me tips on how to get better at the game. The challenges are endless, The graphics are incredible, and in this game, I actually have legs! If you look at the games, I have already purchased, you‚Äôll see my flavor of play. This game is 100% my favorite game, and I look forward to playing it every night. ÔøºOh, I should mention, I am a 61 yo woman!!!",When I was little my folks got me to watch all of Starship Troopers and I love all the movies and when my friend showed me this game I fell in love with it on first glance cuz it reminded me of Starship Troopers plus it has a tower defence mechanic to it that I love. Thank you that made this and hopefully maybe make another enemy that looks like the bugs from the movie.
