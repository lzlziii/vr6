Also i wish you could see the hands and fingers bend when you grasp something. Great set of games!! Can't wait for some updates!","It's pretty good. The fingers really need to bend to show grabbing, though. The fact that the hands are just locked in a single position feels cheap and lacks immersion.",You won't be sorry for buying it.,"12 minigames in one $5 game is a great deal! Air hockey alone is worth the buy! I think that's my favorite one from the entire pack. The physics work really well, heck I pay $5 just to play it for 5 minutes in the arcade. Archery was a lot of fun too, as well as mini gold, checkers, chess, billiards, and bowling. What really surprised me is playing solitaire in VR! A few games, like basketball and table tennis, need some physics adjustment. Overall, if the developer adds multiplayer to the game it will be a great game collection on Quest 2. Well done!","I thought for five bucks I'd give this a go...overall I thought it was a pretty darn good effort, however there were a couple of weak points...but we also have to remember that App Lab stuff is not necessarily final stage, and I'd consider this a very well done Beta. The static games (solitaire, chess, checkers) were excellent...and I agree with your comment about having the AI pause for a moment or two before taking its turn, maybe slowing down the animation a little or adding a floating hand would be a nice tweak. I found the rubiks cube controls a little clunky but usable. The air hockey was a lot of fun, top points there, as was the archery. It was wanting a bit I thought in the other games...table tennis wasn't quite there, and the mini golf physics need a tweak to make the ball travel more realistically as opposed to feeling like it is in sand. I couldn't get the basketball to throw properly, and the bowling wasn't quite there either...close though, maybe a bit more haptic work might help that. Billiards was pretty good too, and showcased how bad I am at it. Overall, I think that there are enough good games in here to warrant the spend. If the devs make a couple of physics tweaks to the action games and one or two minor playability enhancements, that will elevate it into a must-have, especially for the younglings and those starting out in VR."
