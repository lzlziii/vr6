Just a few minor suggestions.. The first is that I became pretty motion sick really fast.. Especially because you get pushed away when getting close to tables and objects. A solution could be those vignettes that are sometimes used, or a helmet or something that blocks your view partially. The second one is not being able to turn using the thumbstick. It could help prevent hitting furniture in our case xD","Its brilliant with a friend, so much fun and also many custom features when it comes to customize you funny charcter. Hope the the devs will keep the good work and bring ad fast as they can also other levels.","This game has an amazing concept, entertaining gameplay and fun to use multi-player. I do have 2 things I'd like to say 1. I know it is still in demo, but it would be nice to have more cosmetics 2. It would be nice to have some sort of name tag system to know who is who. Can't wait for more updates!"
