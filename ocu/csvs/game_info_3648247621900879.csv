Daedalus,"Daedalus is a platformer and an exploration game set in a spectacular oneiric and surrealist world. Daedalus, architect and creator of fantastic mechanical artifacts, was imprisoned by the king Minos to prevent him from sharing his knowledge of Cretaâ€™s Labyrinth with others Every night, in his dreams, Daedalus explores the intricate labyrinths aboard his own winged creations, trying to relive every step, each leap, each flight to freedom, attempting to escape his own tragedy. Help him find the 3 platforms that open the gate of each level and explore the mysterious environments derived from a dream. As the levels progress, the difficulty rises and the architecture grows more and more perplexing. Boost yourself, glide, take advantage of the wind columns, make use of trampolines and activate mechanisms that pour new platforms at your feet to reach your objective.

This is in my top 5 games for sure, along with Eye of the Temple, Tea for God, and RacketNX. The game is a puzzle game, but has combat elements that are nice. The light reflections, puzzles and surfaces are metallic and are some of the nicest visuals I've seen in a Quest game, and I own Red Matter, The Climb 1+2, etc. And, it's so cheap - definitely a steal of a game worth every dime, and 3x more!","This was one of the very first games I bought for my Oculus Go and I was just about to dig it out just to play this game. But, now, the devs have ported it over to the Oculus 2 and I'm loving it. The game is exactly the same, I just get to play it on a better headset. I just finished it and will be going back through it soon. The environments are amazing and a little eerie at the same time. The only note I have for the devs is I'd love to see more levels. Or release a level editor (on Steam?) so we can create our own. Bottom line: this is a VR must and STILL one of a handful of my favorite games of all time.","This is an f'in awesome, fabulous game. The glide feeling is just superb. Looking up at some of the high jumps, feeling intimidated but yet I still float up. Just amazing. The environment is a pleasure. Did I say I love this game? Well I do. I want, no need more! Please please give me more. More levels? A version 2? Anything, but please please work on this as it's one of the best experiences I had on vr.",.... and would like to buy it for any coming headset. Simply all the fun you appreciate of virtual reality.,"Very immersive, beautiful textures and sense of light. Becomes a meditation of sorts. Hope to see more from Vertical Robot. Thx for the experience. 5 stars."
