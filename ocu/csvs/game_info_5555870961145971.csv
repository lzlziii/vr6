Space Dragon,"Have you ever wanted to destroy a world? How about a dozen? Take control of a pair of hatchling space dragons and blast your way through the cosmos with our innovative move-and-warp system. Fight the robotic armadas that have enslaved the massive beasts of the galaxy! Destroy suns, battle monsters hidden within, and leap to new systems through mind-bending wormholes! Dragon Bytes Update 01 You asked and we listened! The two most common points of feedback we received from the VR community were the short length and the lack of variety. We’re proud to announce the first of the free Dragon Bytes updates for Space Dragon, one of many we have planned to expand and improve the game in multiple ways. Here are just a few of the things we’ve introduced: - A major overall performance boost and visual updates - New weapons for the AI enemies, including guided missiles, tracking lasers, and more! - New level events and points of interest - More bullet hell. MORE. - Updated boss fights - Additional level content leading up to the bosses This is just the first of a series of updates coming to Space Dragon in 2023 and beyond.

This game is beautiful! Your hands become Dragon’s that fly through space to fight suns and bosses! The gameplay is fun and the tutorial was well done. I played on the Quest Pro and played both the AR and VR modes. Both were great but I preferred the VR mode as I do in most games! Kudos to the devs for making this uniquely fun and beautiful game!,Was a wonderful experience. Very immersive and you are engaged from the get go. Controls are quite easy to master and really good that you can play both standing and seated. And what more fun than just a dragon than 2 dragons shooting stuff up in space. Would really recommend this game,"Space Dragons is an exhilarating and visually stunning gaming experience that immerses players in the captivating role of controlling a pair of hatchling space dragons. The game’s innovative move-and-warp system adds a refreshing twist to traditional gameplay mechanics, making it a standout among space-themed games. This game is a definite must play especially if you enjoy a unique experience. Great work from the team.","I blew up a Planet with Dragons in my Kitchen and enjoyed every moment, definitely a game I'll spend a lot of time in, flying through space, shooting enemies and disabling force fields at super speeds will never get old. 100% recommended.","Space Dragon Unchained is an Arcade style shooter where your hands are dragon hatchlings! I really enjoyed this concept! You have to destroy planets and worlds to free the other space dragons, all of which are unique. This game was a fun experience and visually stunning. I did have trouble with the movement system at first, but started getting the hang of it after playing for a while, which makes me appreciate the unique controls.
