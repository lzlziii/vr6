Cluster,"Cluster is a social platform based around bringing together players in a virtual space, allowing them to transcend physical constraints — you can access the different “worlds” in Cluster at any time, from anywhere in the world. These “worlds” are spaces created in the virtual world by Cluster and by fellow players, which are free and open to be explored by the curious wandering spirit. From beautiful, aesthetic worlds to activity-filled gaming worlds, there are plenty of options to choose from.",12+,Multiplayer,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,", Creativity & Design, Events, Social","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Japanese",2.89.2308211231,"Cluster, Inc.","Cluster, Inc.",https://cluster.mu/,"Dec 8, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4178943235565629/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4178943235565629&r=1, https://help.cluster.mu/hc/ja/articles/20264222848153",Terms of Service,349.2 MB,"nice app looks a lot like altspacevr.com Only miss the upload of my own Avatar. and building the kits with world, I can't enlarge the kits that will be a plus if this feature also comes. Furthermore I give the app a 5 and advertise a lot in Europe so that more old altspacevr people come here. i miss the altspacevr community a lot with me",I just joined and then when I went down the stairs nobody was there,"Cluster is truly my absolutely favorite amongst VR worlds. Recently I'm using Oculus just for Cluster. The worlds' variety is huge and growing. You can create your own world. And people - people are so friendly!.. Since probably around a month playing with Cluster, I haven't met any toxic people (in VR chat it happens immediately after joining a world). Short, Cluster is a VR gem with mindblowing worlds. I wrote an essay about my experiences here: https://medium.com/merzazine/life-and-art-in-cluster-a636e72dfaee","I don't remember if it didn't work, or I was too lazy to sign up, but I can't be arsed anymore to do that 'take this pin to your desktop browser and sign up so you can experience the empty hub environment of your VR work from home clone."" I'm just too tired.","I've been waiting for this thing to get released on Quest 2 after having some issues with this app, but now it's here and I'm enjoying it. A good alternative to VRChat for those who can't handle VRChat's limitations or performance issues on Quest 2. =PROS= -Performance is better on Quest 2. (Likely because they are using URP instead of the built-in RP) -No avatar limitations (But don't go crazy with performance-heavy features on your avatar) -Big names in Japan hosts good events there. (Ex: MyDearest, Sword Art Online, vSingers like YuNi, etc) -Virtual camera included (With the ability to download it on the website for later) -Cross-platform with PC VR, Quest 2, and smartphones & tablets. =CONS= -Performance issues are still present. (Likely because of unoptimized avatars or worlds, but still, the performance is better than VRChat) -Some big events & V-Items cost some Cluster Coins. (In-game currency that you need to purchase with real money) +On the plus side of Cluster Coins & V-Items, it's a good monetization method for big name event organizers who likes hosting the big event possible, like a concert for example. -Some of the features aren't as advanced as VRChat. (For example, Cluster's built-in camera does not have some features like camera VFX, green-screen, etc) -Photos taken inside Cluster won't be saved on your headset for those who prefer to have it this way. (Unless you take a photo in first-person via your Quest 2 headset's built-in screenshot capture) -Some parts of the app's website aren't fully translated to English. -The most obvious part. Bugs and glitches. (The app crashed at the calibration part if you press the triggers too early before your avatar appears) =VERDICT= While not perfect, Cluster is, in my opinion, a good alternative to VRChat for those who don't want to deal with their immense performance issues, bugs, or for people who like hosting events like music concerts, press conferences, and things that suit their interest."
