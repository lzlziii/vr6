The story and the graphics were perfect. ￼I can’t wait for more to come from this development team. If you liked the Room VR you’re going to love the Atlas Mystery.,"For lovers of The Room, A Rouge Escape, and I Expect You to Die series! Definitely needs some work with lagging, hands getting caught in tables, counters, etc. (However, I'm giving 5 stars because I knew that going into this game as Oculus warned me before hand.) But overall, great game. Great puzzles! I would LOVE to see more from this series!","This murder mystery type of escape room VR game kept me entertained and curious. There were many cool puzzles and they aren't too challenging but there were a couple that took my wife and I combined efforts to solve. Over all I would definitely recommend this game as it provide enough difficulty and intrigue to warrant the price and offer a satisfying and rewarding experience. Recommendation: while I had a smooth game playing experience on my Quest2, my wife had some jitters/lag playing it on her old original Quest. While completely playable, I recommend playing it on a Quest2. Also think it would be cool to offer a couple clues or help when folks get stuck. Perhaps there could be a end score that is impacted negatively if one uses too many clues. Or perhaps cool achievements for those that use none or few. But I still think in game clues would be nice for beginner puzzle gamers.",Not perfect and the puzzles range from hard to way too easy. Sometimes the puzzles are hard just because it's not always apparent what you can interact with. Something that has frustrated me with other puzzle games of this style. I think things should either all be interactive or look distinct from the non interactive items.,"I love this kind of the games, I really love them but I didn't really enjoy this: it was quite frustrating a lot of times! Developers forgot to really mark the things to interact with, so I found myself touching almost everything but not the exact spot, so I was stuck! I would like to give five starts but it doesn't deserve it, for real!"
