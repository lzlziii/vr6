Looked right when I set it up but once in game it was too low. Made rope crossing weird. Ropes in my chest,I only wanted some functions in The Climb 2. This game satisfied what I wanted.,"The overall game idea seems interesting but the actual game itself is somewhat crap, the game looks like a mobile game I would get on a iPhone 5 the detection for when you grab is horrid and the game gets boring extremely fast, there is barely anything to do and in my opinion was a waste of money, a game like this shouldnâ€™t even cost money.","I quite enjoy the game especially climbing, it feels realistic and exiting when you can see how perspectively small you are.","You will put this game away after 15 minutes and never play it again. Very basic, not recommended"
