The puzzles are always enjoyable and exciting, challenges are mostly fun (read below), spooky jump scares combined with the eerie soundtrack and captivating story make this game so much more enjoyable. Additionally, exploring the mansion is awesome + you get collectables for doing so! No matter if you are playing alone or with someone, you will enjoy this unique experience. This being said the game could use some improvements. As others have noted in the reviews, the platforming sections can be very frustrating to say the least. The jumping mechanism is far from perfect which makes the jumping challenges aggravating. For example: The section with the emblematic was extremely challenging for two reasons. One, just jumping on to the platforms is hard but then moving around as the platforms move is almost impossible. The only way I and other have been able to jump on her head to start the challenge was by using the fireplace and one platform to reach the head, but not as intended. Second, after you reach the head with the apples, no matter how physically hard I would throw the apple, the throw would not reach the target or react as it should. I thought I would be stuck here forever but luckily I made the shot after 60 tries. Another almost impossible section is the secret lab with lasers which I am now completely stuck in. I have tried over and over for the last couple of weeks but this section got the best of me. I read the develpers tips and watched walk-through videos but CANNOT pass without hitting a laser. My brother and I have stopped playing ever since. I respect all that the developers do and the great game they created but the platform sections are more frustrating than fun and takes away from the outstanding game experience. This is just my opinion but having seen multiple people complaining over the same issue and hearing it from people that have played, I consider this an issue that can be improved in the future (hopefully soon). Or at least have a skip button that can be paid with sc currency.","I just bought this game , I 'm Brazilian and the game is only in English , I can not play , I would like a refund please","This is absolutely crazy that this game is: fun, creepy, exploratory, has a good story and is FREE. I have been obsessed with this game playing it daily for a week. Love the story and the exploration. But, I think the physics of the game could be improved. There are challenges that you must jump and/or throw things, which have been very irritating to me. I had a very difficult time with the emblematic level, the gymnasium, and now am stuck in the secret lab. It's pretty hard to tell whether or not you actually hit the Lazer, and I wish the jumping and running mechanism would be improved to help on these levels. Giving 5 stars because I love the game and story,and hoping that the devs will improve the physics, or maybe offer an option to skip the jumping and throwing.",Levels are basically unplayable and everything is an add on. Not recommend.,Great game. I've really enjoyed playing it and following all the clues and working things out. Some levels have been harder than others but so far I've managed to work them out. I'm frustrated because I'm stuck at the secret lab. I've tried everything I can think of and I either get transported by a monster or i hit a laser beam. Sometimes I'm not even near it and I get transported. I've been at it for 5 days now and may have to admit defeat which is a shame as I was enjoying the game so much.
