Lol This was probably one of the only games that made me feel like i was on an adventure, and i also get a cute companion with me heheh (Haru). She is very sweet and helpful, I like that she also asks questions that involve you having to actually nod or shake your head. The puzzles were actually challenging and rewarding to solve. I really liked the story as well. The art style and divine weapon design is also very well done. The environment is also very pretty!! I hope to see more from Amata team and Hiromichi Takahashi because they did an amazing job and nailed everything ❤️","Just started playing and it is still a good game but I was expecting more visually, areas seem static and penned in. Definitely could improve the dubbing. Puzzles could be more diverse using more hand mechanics then your point and click guns. Biggest grip would be the scoring at end of each area loses immersion and gives a cellphone game vibe I could do without. Still charming and fun. Worth a play but more $20 than $30 seems about right. Update: puzzles got more complex but still overuse of celestial weapons mechanic. Lightning kami boss is hard because moving her around is too slow to keep her and you from getting hit. Trying to healing Her during this time takes too long when she even holds her hands out.the red area warning on haru is pointless as picking her up takes more time then the attack hits. This fight needs better balancing.",For some reason i can't play it because it has not gone up from 2.85gb since last week I need help,"Incredible combination of first person shooter and puzzle game. I love the cel-shaded art style, and the gameplay I'd absolutely addicting. The game is decently long by VR standards, took me 5 hours and 16 minutes to complete my first playthrough. There are 32 levels in total, with 20 of them being puzzle levels, 5 boss levels, and then the game ends off with a Megaman inspired boss marathon for the last 7 levels. I got this game while on sale and it is more than worth the price. The story is pretty good too but the main reason I love it is for the gameplay.","Its not a bad game, its essentially another puzzle game but with a slight twist that manages to write itself into the story. The reason for 3 stars is because there's no reason for it to be in vr. Its not particularly amazing with empty areas and all. If it were a regular game it would have been the same except maybe boss battles would be easier. As others have said the boss battles are the highlight of the game. As for the puzzles they aren't mind numbingly difficult but they can be hard enough to keep you stuck for a while. The game can be played comfortably sitting and at no point did i experience bugs or have awkward moments where I had to reach but couldn't quite reach and such. Enjoyable but underwhelming."
