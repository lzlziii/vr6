It surpassed all my expetation by the quality of the videos and sound. For the first time in a long time I had the feeling of experiencing something from the future. I hope this app become a success because all involved in this project realy deserve this. Before I go I have to say that putting one free song for each artist was very nice and a proof that you believe in the quality of what is offered.,"This was an amazing experience. The UI is fun and interesting and the Zara Larsson concert was really good. I am really looking forward to Aespa coming up! One thing I notice is that the video during the actual concert does not look as sharp as the video on the artist selection screen. Aespa and Zara looked very clear in the UI but more blurry when watching the actual Zara concert. Also, I was a bit disappointed to see that after paying, the concert is only available for 1 year. Would love for there to be an option to download and view in an external player where you could pause and fast forward/rewind. Overall it was a wonderful experience and can't wait to see more!","TL;DR: This experience truly deserves a place on the Main Store, not just App Lab. It showcases the best of volumetric capture technology in 2023. I'm eagerly anticipating the addition of more artists from around the world, like ReoNA, LiSA, ONE OK ROCK, and many others. Furthermore, I'd gladly pay double the regular price for the option to own it permanently rather than just having a 12-month subscription.",Tried the Megan Thee Stallion VR Concert before and it was insaneee and I'm so happy that AmazeVR is starting to create more content! it feels like Zara Larsson is right in front of you! crazyyyyy! HIGHLYY recommend checking out this experience!! MORE CONCERTS PLSSS!! and can't wait for the aespa one!!,"This is beyond my expectation. I'm truly ""amazed."" Having Zara Larson sing and dance in front of you is something else entirely. It's an experience you would never imagine having in real life. The VR background and the special effects are beautiful too. However, VR concerts do take up a lot of storage space. I worry I won't be able to store too many concerts on my Quest 2 at the same time."
