Hang Gliding - VR Experience,"- Explore a snowy mountain valley on a hang glider. - A relaxing flight through this stunning landscape with frozen lakes and forests. - Use your body to control the flight like in a real hang glider. - Use boost rings for a longer flight. - Try to find a mysterious crash site. Suggestions: - Real parked hang glider. - Structure simulating a hang glider. - Sensory swing. - Hammock chair / Swing. (Simulates a supine hang glider.) (less comfortable) - Working at height equipment. - Nest swing. - Hammock. (Uncomfortable) - Mechanic creeper / Platform trolley. - Horizontal tire swing. (Do not use) - Chair with wheels. - Swings with little body contact area. Tips: - Suction Cup Grab Bars are a safe and practical alternative to fixed bars. - Use a fan to increase the feeling of immersion. Safety: - Do not use open hooks, lateral movements can cause the rig to come loose from the hook, use carabiners instead. - Do not use chairs with wheels, a wheel could lock sideways and overturn the chair. - Do not use improvised or poorly fixed bars. - Wrap the bar with foam and use a mattress below your body. - Never use handrails in high places as a bar. - It is recommended that you always have someone close to help in any situation. This is a challenging and laborious Quest port of the classic Unreal Landscape Mountains Showcase. All credits to the talented team at Epic Games related to the original project.
