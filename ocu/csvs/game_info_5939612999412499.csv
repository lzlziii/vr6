As usual simple planes did not dissapoint in the VR version. Most Definitely my favorite vr flying game on the quest store. Simple planes is a bit cartoony in style but dont let that fool you from the immersive and vast creations they offer. Since I have the acual game I build my planes and test them out in the vr version wich I think is pretty amazing.,I love this game day in and day out although the only thing I wish is that if you could search for something but besides that it’s a great game and was worth buying,"This game is so fun I have spent dozens of hours playing it, though I wish there was a bit more in the Sandbox game mode as there are not a whole lot of things on the ground to shoot at other than boats. Though being able to spawn enemy planes and such to shoot down does sort of make up for it. Still over all a well made and awesome game 10/10 Love all the little details you might not notice too, all the planes are super fun and simple to understand their functions, there is also a little clipboard that tells you how to start the plane if you’re new to the plane. For sure must have game.","If you are into aviation (especially military aviation), you have to get this game. By far the best flight simulator for the oculus quest. Infinite planes to choose from, a big map, extreme dogfights, and straightforward controls. I can spend countless hours playing this game because there is always something new to do, unlike other VR games. Best investment of $10 in my life.",It’s just great being able to fly use weapons and interact with stuff in game
