I am always looking for relaxing games on Quest and they're so hard to find. From the moment I opened up SkyBinder, I was taken to a zen place. The puzzles are challenging and fun, and the audio is *chef's kiss*. Can't wait to recommend this to my friends.","This experience is something that is built for (literally but also figuratively) for the VR medium. After a quick and intuitive training, the player can easily stretch and rotate the world around them with a remarkable natural ease. This allows the immersion to really set in so that the music and the challenging puzzles come into focus. I really love this and could spend a lot of time in the experience, pushing myself cognitively while really vibing out!",After few levels it is start to be bit boring.,"This game is beyond description, utterly amazing, it's like someone took the concept of connect the dot style art AND tangrams, which I love, and made them 3D. Crazy fun and relaxing while also challenging your skill in spatial realtions. I saw it on a Oculus Facebook group and asked to be told when it was released as it looked amazing. Well whoever it was I asked promptly told me when it released and I bought it day one. I love supporting developers whenever possible, IF I like or believe in what they are doing and this game is beyond amazing and worth every penny.",I absolutely love this puzzle game. The concept of connecting the dots to make an origami-like creature is simple but the sound design and the way you can scale and rotate your model make for a richly immersive and pleasant experience. The sound and animation make you feel particularly euphoric when you complete a puzzle figure and you just want to keep connecting more dots!
