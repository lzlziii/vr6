It's great for learning drinks. I just recently finished bartending school, and this was great for practicing. However, where I live, everything is measured in Oz and Cups. I'm hoping that in the near future, they will let you change to this option (Oz) and also add more common drinks! Maybe as an add-on, additional drinks, and a fancy restaurant setting. Also, in Rooftop Bar, the first woman glitches, and in V.I.P Challenge, the ""Money Maker"" challenge, all the drinks are mostly in the same sequence and not really random. All in all, Great game simulator! Great replay value!",I have been enjoying this game but have found a bug. The metal shaker that you put down tends to disappear and I have to start making the drink all over again. The only way to have the shelter stay is to keep it in your hand. If this bug can be fixed so I can enjoy a otherwise fun game.,I've played this game for 2 hours and I think it's okay if you want to learn how to make drinks definitely get this game it gets a little repetitive at times and you definitely need to be able to memorize things but I think if you think you're going to like this game you probably will so I suggest it,"I was really looking forward to playing this game, but unfortunately I am unable to. You start with a trial to show you the ropes on the first few drinks to make, and i was getting into it until it came time to add the soft drink components of the cocktail. They are stored in a two level fridge, which required me to bend down with my hand inches from the floor for the top shelf, and required me to go below the floor for the second shelf whilst seated. I recentred multiple times, but unfortunately this game is not designed with accessibility in mind, and as such is unable to be played sitting down. The settings have no accessible features, so I cannot play this game. It's a fun concept and I'm sure I would enjoy it if the game devs make adjustments. Perhaps put the mixers on the bar behind, instead of below, or enable the user to 'crouch' in game. Please consider disabled gamers when making a game.","I think the game worked really nicely and it was super fun to pour two ingredients at the same time as you see in movies. It gave a good challenge in trying to remember all recipes for drinks. I do wish there were more voice lines for when you fail at making the drink. The only bug I noticed that kept happening was when I was in the nightclub the fridge was very hard to open and sometimes when I opened it, it would close immediately. Overall, I think this game is great and priced perfectly and I would recommend to all my friends."
