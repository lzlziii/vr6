Piano VR,"You want to play piano but do not have one? Play piano in virtual reality anywhere you want, without using any cables or controllers, only using your hands, like in real world. With the upgraded hand tracking system, now it is more than possible to do it.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Music",English,0.7,Oleg Eni,Hybrid XR,https://hybridxr.dk/,"Oct 14, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3907485762605933/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3907485762605933&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d67fyQdUYa-TUdABOGyEe1FnDVGJGXfbAGX3ct6rQSw/edit",218.3 MB,"First off, the graphics are great, the piano sound is also very good (I’m not a pianist -but would like to be) and the ability to position the keyboard is well done.. On the down side, this App needs more of a tutorial. The few instructions that are given (pick a song) are marginal so you are left in a world of ‘trial and error’. Not a good way to start. Perhaps my biggest complaint is the hand tracking. Of course, it lacks any tactile features (I can’t wait for that) so your hands kind of ‘float over the keys’ - bummer. On top of that, my hands do not seem to fit or move on the keyboard as I direct them. Perhaps, some sort of training program would help – something that starts you off with something a bit more elementary than Lukin Park or My Heart Will Go On. I also notice that if I waited to set aside my controllers and move into hand control after I entered the App, hand control was very intermittent -- quite often my hands would disappear, and I would have to wait for them to reappear – they usually did; eventually. BUT, if I had already evoked hand control BEFORE entering the App it worked MUCH better. I’m using the latest Quest 2 update V43 and I tried various lighting scenarios but the above arrangement is what resulted in better results. One more thing that does not seem to work is trying to play ‘on your own.’. It starts off ok but you soon lose the sound --- wait a minute or two and the sound returns. This might be the result of having one of the optional works selected but if so, I have not found a way around it. Don’t mean to sound too negative because I really like this App. The keyboard is fantastic, I just need to be able to play it. At this point I’ve rated this App 3.5 stars – but, I think it has the potential to go way above that.","When I first tried to play Piano vr like a physical piano, I realized that the physics is different, really different from a regular piano. So I just started playing around. Then Played around some more. The keyboard is like nothing I've tried before. The latest Quest 2 update V39 has much better hand tracking, which makes Piano VR much more fun, though I suspect Quest pro or Quest 2+ or whatever, will improve hand tracking more. So, if you are looking for a keyboard that handles like a physical piano, you may be disappointed. But I must say I really like this keyboard in Piano VR. Thanks so very much to the developer for this unique app. 4.5 Stars. The controls for the menu could use some improvement especially the start/stop record audio control and the quit app control. Again Thanks so much.","Could have letters and number on the keys. Because of the lighting the piano looks like all one key. Hand tracking isn’t good enough for this, even when in the description it says its been modified. Needs more pianos, this game should be completely free for what’s given, completely wasted my money and time, and if you even want to make it better make controller support, controller barely works. ON THE GOOD SIDE, this is the only piano game on oculus app lab and oculus store and this is pretty good for what it says “0.7” version, I could definitely see this going somewhere with development","this game is good but, it needs some hands instead of just dots, its a nice piano game anyways and one of the only ones so ill rate it a 3 for now, but i can see this game becoming alot more better","Hand tracking is horrible, have to type each key with your pointer every minute, not accurate at all and lighting is horrible, might as well be trashed."
