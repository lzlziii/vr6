Innkeeper VR,"EARLY ACCESS It's time to take on the role of the Innkeeper of a fantasy tavern. Stock up on booze! Pour and serve drinks to your guests. And remember... All the rowdy ones must be thrown out of the tavern! PLEASE NOTE: Early access means we're still working hard on the game and it's not perfect yet. But we highly appreciate any feedback, so feel free to share it in our Discord.

One thing I have a problem with is I can’t get the waitress to serve anything at all and I wasted 400 gold to try and make her serve a beer. I think when the full version comes out that a multiplayer version should come out as well, making it a lot easier to do stuff. Still though, is a great game if you want to relax.",After I saw the video of this game on TikTok I bought it immediately. Great game. There are bugs here and there. But the game isn't fully out yet. So there is plenty of time for them to improve the game,"I never get sick on most games but the way the game is and the movement make me sick to the stomach. I know ist a Applab game and I've played them before but this one is different. Also the games really isn't that fun, I would rather go to actual work IRL the play this game. I thought it would be a fun game to do stupid stuff but the only ""fun"" this you can do is grap people and throw them around. Just isn't a game for me.",It’s so fun I’m not even kidding you can play the game like a normal innkeeper and do everything correct or you can just mess around and have fun,"It could use a cook, a money collector, security guard, and a option to have multiple of the same staff and a option to buy them permanently or a way to upgrade them. Options to have only a certain amount of customers in at a time so it's less stressful. Also you can clip into the 5K tavern by going into the the menu walking to the edge of your boundry and walking to the other side. An option to serve only beverages. Please make it harder to get five stars I'd recommend having to get 1K points as it adds a more fulfilling goal. And a new more expensive tavern would be nice. Aside from that this game is great would recommend"
