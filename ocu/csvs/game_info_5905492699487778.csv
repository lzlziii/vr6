Maybe make the customers eat faster, and allow more to come in at the same time, like 2 customers order together for example. Another thing would be customers walking up to the front instead to get their order then leaving immediately instead of dining in. There's also a save glitch to where it'll load my previous save but I cant save after playing for some time unless I reload the save, deleting the progress I had made. Thank you for reading this!",Items you order fall out of the basket. So can't carry them all in. Brush is hard to pick up if you drop it Cupboards hard to open . I have to play this sitting down or I get terrible motion sickness... Be great if you could point and teleport. Love the idea though . looking forward to the updates,"Like real life! I used to work as barista some years ago and this game just remembered me that times. You make the lists with what you need, order ingredients, brew a lot of coffee(there are a lot of coffee recipes in this game), serve the customers, wipe the floors, throw the garbage, extend the shop for more customers to come, and you have all the time something to do in this game. I really enjoy it. üëçüèª","This game is fun to do, but it is extremely glitchy. When I bought food items, it took my money, but nothing appeared in the back where the other items are dropped off. Also, I think the machines should be stable and not easily knocked over. Sometimes the hands are way above Ôøºmy head and I have to restart the game. Other than that it's a new and fresh concept and I really enjoy it.",The Graphics are just astonishing! Quest need more games like this
