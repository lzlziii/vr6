Voices of Inspiration,"Voices of Inspiration is an experience that immerses you in the audio stories, aspirations, and artwork of children at St. Jude as you journey to the stars in a futuristic space elevator. Built in collaboration with the astronauts of the Inspiration4 SpaceX mission, explore beautiful virtual worlds as you awaken small creatures to reveal voice messages left by St. Judes patients... and reflect on their stories as you ascend into the stars.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Documentary & History, Social, Space/Universe",English,1.51,Lucas Rizzotto,Thought Co.,http://lucasrizzotto.com/,"Oct 1, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4384324444988465/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4384324444988465&r=1, https://www.lucasrizzotto.com/voices-of-inspiration-privacy-policy",Terms of Service,504.4 MB,"Very graphically lush and capable. More so than St Jude Hall of Heroes'. Contains many 'floors' one for each question that the respondents answer, and you listen too.
