But I could not for the life of me figure out the controls. Please add directions or tutorial. Nice graphics. Nice gameplay from what I can play. Great game idea! Will revisit rating after this is addressed. Thank you for the game!! Good job!,I can't figure out the controls. I can only grab the reflectors but can't move it and my character can't move. I've tried all the combination of controls. Very frustrating.,"I don’t understand how this game has such a low rating, this is some of my favorite types of games. Yes it may not be for everyone but if you’ve ever played a laser like game on your phone this is exactly the same thing just in VR. The only negative thing I see if the controls, it would be so much better if we could have smooth locomotion instead of teleport. And possibly even a couple tutorials."
