This game allows you to experience table tennis most similarly to reality, and we can play table tennis with your friends or people from all over the world. The sensation of hitting the ball and the movement of the ball according to the spin provide a perfect immersive feeling that is sometimes indistinguishable from reality. If you want to have an experience that suits you, you can also adjust the detailed options in almost every part. Several types of racquets are also currently on sale that can be attached to the controller just for this game. There is no doubt that this game is one of the top 3 games recommended for the best VR experience, along with Beat Saber and Real VR Fishing. If you bought Quest 2, I'm pretty sure this is a game you should definitely add to your library. The best thing about this game is... That's right, you don't have to run around to pick up a dropped ball! ;-) 💎💎💎💎","The best computer game I have ever seen! I am very grateful to the developers for the opportunity to fully play sports at my age after fifty years. And not just any sport, but a sport that I love. It's even better than real table tennis because you don't need a table and other equipment, you don't need a partner, and you don't even need enough space for a table. In my room, there is only 2.10 by 2.30 meters of free space and that's enough. It's not just a game, it's a real miracle. This is the future that has already arrived. Humanity just hasn't realized it yet :)","I play defensive style so my chops n blocks are usually the most effective for me. Playing with bots the only right strategy is combination of force and topspin. My play style bases on tricky shots with unconvenient spin and unexpected combinations. But playing with bots dont even try these, I may attempt the craziest rally of chops from under the table but the only result is that responses will be mostly no spin easy return. In order to actually score you need to go with topspin and there is no way round. Bots seem to be quite unbalanced afterall. Multplayer is an option as long as your connection is stable. Playing online with a lag is a pure pain. Also notice worthy is that performing some higher level serves is hard due to poor feedback from ball touch (just sound and visuals limited by fov). To sum up, game is eorth buying and complaints comes from hours devoted on playing so 4/5 stars are well deserved.","I have a real table tennis on my garage, but keep playing this game because I can always find someone to play against (my wife and kid are not good enough 😂) and its the closest experience to play irl Play almost 30 minutes every day, and then a shower. I take it seriously 😅 I want to mention to the DEVS that my microphone is not working in the game: tried everything, checked oculus settings, app settings and nothing seems to make it work. Any suggestions??? Anyway, as I don’t really need to use the mic, 5 stars for you boys","Use ""elevenvr.bio.link"" for your purchase! This rocks! It's like the real deal in virtual reality. The way you can control the paddle feels so natural, and the ball physics are on point. Whether you're a ping pong pro or just want some VR fun, this game won't disappoint."
