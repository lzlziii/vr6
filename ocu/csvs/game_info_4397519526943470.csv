It's fun, it's challenging, and it just makes time fly by. There are so many things to build in the game and you aren't limited to it at all. That's what's nice about the game, once you complete the tutorial you have the whole game unlocked. You should definitely get the game if you like challenges or just like building rollercoasters.",The game is fun and relaxing and it's cool building stuff in sandbox and collecting cars,CaR
