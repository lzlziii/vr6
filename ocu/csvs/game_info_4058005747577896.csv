It´s like a Cut the Rope wanna be, but with a dog and VR sticks. Cool to play for a while, but annoying after a time because it repetitive. Specially the sounds and music that repeat all over. The dog´s crying is boring.","I liked the atmosphere, music, and gameplay. Really nice stress-release game. Liked the puzzle as easy to challenging."
