MultiMeasure,"Need to quickly find the length between one end of the room to the other? Does the kitchen need a new floor and you want to quickly find the area? MultiMeasure is the perfect, easy to use tool for all your measuring needs. Use the length tool by defining your start and stop points and the app does the rest. The area tool gives you the ability to create and shape you need by creating points and calculating the surface area. The angle tool helps show an angle for example a slanted ceiling or non-90 degrees corner of a room.

I wish I grew up learning the metric system but sadly, I have not. I would really like an option to change this.","I received the code from the developer, and gave it an honest go. Overall, it’s a useful utility, but has some limitations- the app helpfully advises against using this as an accurate tool, so it’s probably good to just get quick general measurements. First, cons: The tutorial is useful, but could do with some more hand-holding; the controls are simple, but things such as switching between area and length required a trip to the menu, which the tutorial didn’t cover. It also didn’t cover angles, which this app can also measure, nor did it cover multi-measurements. Some of the features are locked behind a paywall, but that’s par for the course these days, so nothing to hold against the dev. Perhaps the biggest issue I’ve had with it is there’s not an easily apparent way to clear the canvas, short of restarting the app. If this is something locked behind the paywall, it’s an annoying requirement. Also, the there is no way to measure anything other than metric- my plan was to use this for some home improvements and renovations- in the US, imperial is king for nearly all home builders (despite the obvious benefits of metric). Also, the smallest unit of measurement is meter, to two decimal places- quick math can make it cm, but measuring my 12in ruler came up as 0.3m, when it should be something like 0.305m. Lastly, the UI could use some work- it’s sometimes hard to gauge where I’ve clicked a starting or ending point, and some menus require the toggle be “moved” off and on, like a switch, instead of a two-state button. Pros: Multi-measurement is amazing, and seeing a rough sketch of a proposed plan in 3D and being able to walk around in AR really brings the concepts of “sizes” to life- it’s easy to say a couch is 8ft long, but to actually see the measurement in your eyes does make it pop. The utility supports default lengths up to 1m, snap measurements to align to a 3D (hidden) grid, and area measurements can be in the same AR space as line measurements. In addition, while it does require that the headset stays within a room scale boundary, the measurements can be outside of that boundary. I’d like to see the ability to clear the canvas without restarting the app, and if there was a good way to export measurements or a 3D export utility to see this in AR on another device, that would be king. As it is, it’s a useful utility to demonstrate a potential project and the sizes it would take. I can see myself using this to show my wife a 3D view of a proposed home renovation project and letting her walk through it.","App warns to double check measurements, but it is very reliable. Used it to quickly measure a patio and was a able to measure areas and show my wife how much space the furniture she liked would take in a way that made sense. great app!","With refinement and more resources put into it, this would be a great tool for interior design and planning. I’m excited to see where it goes."
