It can help make exercise more entertaining ,motivating and interesting. Vrit offers a solid variety of different workouts and gradually becomes more challenging to test your limits. The workouts are hands free and can help you burn calories and build muscle. I highly recommend it. The price is worth it. The game is well made. No subscription either. Imagine that and to top it all off you could achieve a better workout in Vrit in the comfort of your home than going to a gym. This game is so underrated.",Love this! Range of exercises. No subscription - what’s not to like?,The game is very simple but delivers a lot of exercises that I could not find in other apps without a subscription...,"I use this app RELIGIOUSLY now every morning and love how this app allows you to put down the controllers and use your hands for a change. I always HATED doing burpees, squats, running in place, etc. (basically cardio) and this app you don’t even realize you’re doing it because your arms are freakin’ laser beams! Join the discord as the Dev is active and he DOES listen to suggestions! This app is a STEAL for the price it’s at and with more updates I can see this being a household app in the app store when it gets past the development stage. This app is well worth the purchase and I recommend it to everyone who is looking to get fit and having a blast! Looking forward to seeing what's in store for the next update :D","I love Eleven Table Tennis, Supernatural and Les Mills BodyCombat but Vrit is my favorite.. It's so hard for me to find the motovation for doing burpees, push-ups, and other classic exercises. Vrit gives you the motivation to do them and want to do more. With all other fitness apps, I usually sweat a lot from my head due to the headset. With Vrit, I also soaked my shirt and sweatpants. Note to the amazing creator: You could use the bird voice to guide us for the stretching and better show the stretching movements with a character wearing a headset. It looks like some obstacles are missing when running. It might be also good to better explain how to shoot with open hands instead of pointing the index finger. In any case, even if details here and there could be improved, this is an amazing app. It should be upgraded to the oculus store."
