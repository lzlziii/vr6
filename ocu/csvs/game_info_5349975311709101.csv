I know its just a game, but it can really help aswell, would definitely recommend.",Just a great cricket sim. Really good tracking of the bat and some of the best physics I've seen/felt in VR.,Update has bugs. It just freezes in the middle of the game and one has to start over. It's a paid game and a big disappointment that has started after the updates. It was amazing and worked flawlessly before that. Developers needs to focus on fixing the crashes.,"Hi, I have been playing this game for a while now and was really enjoying it. I too a few weeks break and came back to a new update and it has literally broke the game. The bounce for the spinners in unrealistic and middling the ball is almost impossible. The difficulty level is through the roof compared to last patch and the game just isn't fun anymore. Thai should have been a 1 start review, but I am giving 3 starts because I originally did love the game and issue is only with the current patch",The app is frequently getting banged in the middle. Too many glitches
