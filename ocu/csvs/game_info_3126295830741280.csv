Please fix the control back to the way it 2as b4 or give the options I used to play every day but now I can shoot because the guns are magnets to my left hand lik side arms and grenades and in my way like when you look around even they are in the way not cool anymore asit makes the game unplayable for me .. I have tons of games this is my favorite It needs more maps tho .. ....Was my favorite game ...,I've deleted all my original and updated posts. I'll just keep it short. I've played since day one. I quit about two months ago. I get on once in awhile to check things out. Do not buy. You will most likely play with bots and there will never be an update.,"The entire notoriety system is completely broken and needs to be scrapped and disposed of. Whoever thinks the way it works is a fantastic element of the game, either doesn't actually play the game, or they're clueless about what notoriety is and how it should be reflected in a game. No one should EVER lose 20 points when they're standing on top of the podium in first place. The developers are lacking common sense and have ZERO logic! The way the game is built caused me to stop playing it for 2-months. I expect the devs will continue to ignore the endless game breaking complaints and there will soon be nothing more than bot-filled lobbies. Sad, because it has the most potential of any VR game on the market, but dev pride is getting in the way of greatness! Update: After waiting until the game is completely dead, the devs FINALLY listened and changed the notoriety system. Increasing my rating by 1-star, but too little, WAY TOO LATE!! Might be able to salvage what's left if the game was made free-to-play. And don't expect any support from the ""official"" Discord. I had several support tickets I filed and NONE were ever acknowledged or addressed...in fact all of the issues I brought up still afflict the game. Also, the community moderator doesn't play, nor understand the game and has no concept of how comp scenes operate, so she effectively helped kill-off the game. Self-proclaiming you're an expert in VR and community engagement doesn't make it so!","I like all type games. I own 100+ quest games and really like this one. I am not a FPS fanatic. I like all types of games. FPS games are my least played but I really enjoy Larsenauts. It is really fun. Fast paced yet lots of strategy. I have played all the top FPS games and will say without naming them that I believe this is the top 5 game. It has it all. Fast pace yet tons of strategy. Good graphics and sound. Awesome community, even though small. Let’s make this game pop. It is so fun. It had a rough start but the devs have really turned this into a gem. My personal favorite multiplayer FPS out. If you like Overwatch on flat screen this is a must.",I love this game but it needs faster matchmaking- also maybe a DPS or Ammo capacity for manual reload to add an advantage to it other than being realistic but other then that’s is pretty good But breachers is better
