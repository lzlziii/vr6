There are two modes to choose from and a nice tutorial to start with as well as a collection of ships to be steered with the head moving through the different courses. There are obstacles to avoid or to shoot away with the trigger of the right controller and cubes to collect on the way. However, in the menu you can select with the head but you need to use the trigger of the left controller to confirm any action. It took me a while to find out how to proceed. I really hope the developers will continue to work on this racing game, since I see its high potential. Please include a ranking system for each course. I will be happy to give it more stars and to update my feedback.",Cartoons Grafik is good way for Quest Games,"Thank you for checking out AirRacer!
