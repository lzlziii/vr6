I found sitting down helps to keep things a little more stable, but after a few of those joystick turns and flying through the rings, I could feel my eyes spinning out of my head. Highly recommend this game on other flat screen consoles, but skip this if you’d be bothered by getting dizzy!","This game is excellent,I bought it 1st on Xbox (need to play with headphones) then I saw this on quest no question I had to double dip ,this was meant for VR the tunes the gameplay this is a gem of a game ,the only neg I can say is the a and b inputs need to be completely different colours because as is they are too similar,but don't let that put you off you will have a euphoric time ,one of my top 5 in my library","I have this game on Xbox one and absolutely love it. Unfortunately the control configuration for vr has made it very frustrating. Going from console with all abxy on the right side to this, where those buttons are split between left and right is difficult but doable. What bothers me more is that no motion controls were used. For any movement other than abxy, motion sensors should have been used, making the game not only more immersive but more user friendly and fun. Having to use a thumb stick means you're constantly needing to either move your thumb from joystick to a button on the same controller lightning fast or means you have to keep switching up between using left and right joystick which adds even more confusion to the button configuration. A quick upwards, left, or right movement with the controllers should have been implemented to achieve jumps and left/right rotation. Still recommended but I'm just very disappointed with the controls and will never achieve the scores and level progression I did on console. The game could have and deserved to be planned out better.","I really enjoy the flatscreen version of the game on my PC. Unfortunately, the VR version does not support playing with a Bluetooth controller, it is very awkward to play with the oculus touch controllers. Is proper controller support planed for the future? With the default controller inputs, the game is barely 3*","I Hadn't spent much time with Tim's music before this game since I had a young child at his popularity peak, but it's a great way to get exposed to it if you aren't already a fan. Most consistent soundtrack of any music game, pretty much every track is a banger. It's basically a rhythm game with some fzero elements thrown in, with beautiful environments and effects, and a killer soundtrack. Knowing his story, it almost feels like he still lives on through this game, his little starship forever searching for happiness. The difficulty ramps up as you go down the list of each difficulty mode, so playing the songs in the order listed rewards you with a slow increase in difficulty. The only negative thing about this game is there will never be more songs or a sequel. RIP Tim. Thanks for sharing your music with the world."
