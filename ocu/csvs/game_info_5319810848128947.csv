Holy Fire Pilot Version,"""Nothing in life is to be feared; it is only to be understood.” Maria Skłodowska–Curie Holy Fire is an interactive documentary experience that explores humankind’s difficult relationship with nuclear energy. It looks at the technology's tragic upscaling into risky nuclear power plants all across the world and examines the early days, when scientists were full of hope after discovering this genuine philosopher's stone. The players can travel into the core of a nuclear reactor, become part of the liquidator squad that cleaned up after the Chernobyl disaster and travel back in the past to Maria Skłodowska–Curie’s highly radioactive laboratory with dosimeter at hand. This is a free pilot version of the upcoming extended Holy Fire experience. It is a cooperation between Causa Creations & Theaterkollektiv Hybrid, and was generously supported by Vienna's MA7 and the Austrian Ministry for Art, Culture, Public Service and Sports via their ""Kunst und Kultur im digitalen Raum"" program.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Entertainment,"Documentary, Experimental, History",English,0.9,Causa Creations,Causa Creations,https://causacreations.net/,"Jan 24, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5319810848128947/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5319810848128947&r=1, https://causacreations.net/holyfire/privacyPolicy.html",365.8 MB,"Wow.
