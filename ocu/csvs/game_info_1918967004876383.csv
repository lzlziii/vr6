The deep bas sounds effects during combat (when ships explode) is something I really appreciate, and the music really sets a great tone in the game. Never got tired of it. The possibility to pause/freeze the time is also available, which is an essential function that allows for coordinating attacks and managing the different ships and weapon systems. It’s also pretty cool to watch attacks unfold in this mode as it doesn’t fully freezes time but keeps it running at super slow speed, allowing to see weapons fire and explosions expand in ultrarapid. Feels little like bullet time. Pretty neet! This is a great game for anyone that enjoys games like FTL and Homeworld. It’s a mix of both and is really exellent use of VR. A tip to new players it to check the options menu to set your preferred navigation settings as the ones that were set as default wasn’t all that intuitive.","I loved the game, I felt like locutus of Borg, commanding a fleet, vocally ordering them to attack. Great story, great graphics for what it is, and it was a great game, but my Q2 got too full on storage, and was pretty much broken. so I factory reseted it, problem solved! I redownloaded all my games. Every game I had worked, aside from this one, I don’t know why, but as soon as I get past the intro, and try to actually play the game it starts going crazy, and freezes. I give it 5 stars because I don’t think it’s a problem with the game, more likely something to do with resetting my headset. I only wish I could play it, because it is a great game","This game is really cool! The concept is neat, the gameplay is interesting, different and it sort of scratches my star trek itch to command space vessels. I think it's simple and intuitive to control, the graphics are good and the music is great. Also the updates added many needed features and helpful adjustments. Easy and Medium are lots of fun to play but I cannot say the same about hard. I played 4 times today and died in the second mission every time. I never saw death on easy and VERY rarely on Medium 1 of 5 play throughs. The resources seem extremely scarce to the point where you can't improve your ship, buy anything, or repair in between missions where no stores are available. And at stores you're caught between upgrading your ship/buying weapons or repairing not both but both are needed to withstand the 3-4 next missions until another store. Today I had 26 armor left after a mission with not enough parts to repair and at the start of the very next mission, I warped into the battle zone only to land next to two armed asteroids who immediately took out my shields without my being able to move or react in time..Seriously?! I get that Hard needs to be difficult, but that situation was cheap fulfillment of that objective. Are environments randomized? Probably but developers shouldn't allow that to happen. I like to think humans flying in space ought to know how to avoid threats like that. They literally got free shots at me while I couldn't even react. I'm honestly writing this because of that experience and combined with the permadeath it makes Hard not worth playing because it's a waste of time (yet medium and easy are no challenge at all awaste of time after beating it once). Additionally, it's super frustrating to be flying parallel and within range of Targeted enemies for long distances and my cannons don't fire whatsoever or does a small burst with a 60% hit rate only to wait a very long time before firing again. Having no control over the firing of cannons is the other main reason I'm writing the review because there was really no reason the cannons shouldn't fire-- there was no need for cool down, the enemy was in range, it was lined up with the side of my ship where the guns are, and the enemy was clicked on and targeted, all the while they had 0 problem lighting me up the entire time. I got so pissed and started yelling at my ship to fire and after I died, I quit the game to write this. On Hard, I can't afford to not be firing when in range of the target since enemies do so much damage and repairing is very difficult. I loved the game before and sought out a challenge with Hard but with the issues experienced above make the game impossible to play and honestly left me soured on the game overall. I can't say I've beaten a game unless it's on the hardest difficulty but these conditions feel unreasonable and I'm starting to feel fine never picking it up again.","I absolutely love this game. The experience of controlling a multi-ship space battle in three dimensions is what VR is for, and Eternal Starlight doesn’t disappoint. The layers of strategy and tactics are deeper than they first appear. You have to assemble a fleet, and customize your ships, in ways that complement each other and work together as a team. If you just add weapons and ships without a plan, you’ll lose the final battle… but when you carefully assemble the perfect fleet and win, it’s hugely rewarding. When in battle, you have to think pretty fast, though you are allowed to slow down time to a crawl and consider your next set of moves and attacks. Here again, it’s a blast to give a bunch of orders, unpause, and watch your tactics succeed (or fail) to destroy the enemy. One thing I didn’t love was the graphics and design of the aliens you talk with on the communication screen - it seemed kind of cheap and rushed. But that’s a brief and unimportant part of the game, you’ll find yourself skipping though the dialogue. Until someone finally releases “Homeworld” for VR, this is the closest thing.","I was on the fence about my keeping my Oculus. Eternal Starlight made the decision to keep it easy. This game is special, you get that “wow” moment the first time you zoom in from a field of ships to an engine subsystem of one for annihilation. I keep coming back to this game again and again to explore different fleet compositions & special weapons. Definitely buy!"
