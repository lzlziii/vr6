I hear you ask.Well it's amazing because i won't spoil anything but ones you find the secret that's when the game begins, and the game has a lot of replayability and a lot of post game . One of the best VR experience's I have ever had . Must have game. And I am excited for The Unity Sphere, but the game also does what it's actually supposed to which many triple a titles can't do these days so it's good to see that game devs can still make good game's that do what they promised. 10/10",🍆🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🍼🍼🍼🥛🥛🥛🍼🍼🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🍼🍼🥛🥛🍼🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🥛🍼🍼🥛🍼🍼🥛🍼🍼🍼,Cube.
