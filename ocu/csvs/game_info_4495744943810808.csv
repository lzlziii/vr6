It is very difficult to develop the game in China, because you will encounter denials from this country, from society, and from family. But as always, we came to Facebook and came to oculus, and through layers of technical assessments, we completed the initial demo of this game. The game is now 5% complete.

To get answers to improve the game, I will seriously answer every comment from players from other parts of the world!","Dont get what I suppose yo do with Chica man, he keep pointing at the stars and I drop them and they explode but nothing elae"
