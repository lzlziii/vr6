Don't waste your money... UNBELIEVABLE SMH,"Wow, what a waste of money, I bought this thinking it was going to be something good , Boy was I wrong, the hole game is poor the graphics are bad if you get close up they pixelate, The controls are hard ,and the aliens are pretty ðŸ’©. I have played it a few times and I keep finding myself stuck behind stupid things like boxes , and I can't get out ,so I have to start again, or you get stuck in the walls ,even been stuck in the door frame, and had to reset, Also you can stand in the door ways to shoot the aliens it won't let you ,you have to enter the room before damage can be done. Poor","The game states it's not finished so I will hold on to this game for time being. Not much to do apart from search ship for aliens. And they're not very hard to kill. The big alien/monster I came across early in the game does nothing to you. Walked right up to it and it done nothing. Felt kinda bad killing it. On the plus side, the guns are lovely to fire and would be a joy to use in a more finished game with more threat. Need vibration when firing the guns. Sound could be more atmospheric, with eerie music or something. The footstep sounds become extremely annoying. There's potential there, but at moment it's not much of a game. I'll look forward to updates.","it's fun, the visuals are good, guns are amazing, and by god, it is so horrifying"
