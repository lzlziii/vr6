InRun is fun too, but Neodori has better controls. When it comes to racing, perfect controls are WAY more important than flashier graphics. Donâ€™t get me wrong, this game is no slouch in the graphics department. Finally, Neodoriâ€™s frame rate beats InRun by a mile imo. Again, high frame rates are essential for racing games, and Neodori nails it. For $10, everyone should purchase Neodori and support these smaller developers so we continue getting hidden gems such as this. Hey developers, Iâ€™d happily pay for some more DLC tracks and carsâ€¦ wink wink, nod nod ;) keep up the great work","Its been awhile since I've drained my quest 2's battery in one sitting. After my first play sessions with Neodori Infinity Ive nearly gone through 3 charges, its that good! First off I will say, this doesnt feel like an early release/applab game. This is a complete game that should absolutely be on the official quest store. Graphics are excellent. The 10 different worlds are incredibly scenic and were a pleasure to unlock. Racing through each world is buttery smooth. Drifting mechanics feel incredible and are easy to pick up. All 15 or so soundtracks are a pleasure to drive to. Tons of unlockable cars (40+). There are 5 different modes all together. The standout of the bunch is ""Endless mode"" where you drive through all 10 worlds on a loop trying to score as many points before running out of gas. There is also a ""Zen mode"" which is basically a chill endless mode (no obstacles). With all of the positives out of the way, heres where I think the developer can improve: +Focus on improving endless mode +Add global leaderboards +Improve scoring system in endless mode (winning/losing races adds/deducts points, bumping into obstacles deducts pts, etc.) +Improve fuel drops (feel inconsistent) At just under $10 this a no brainer purchase for any racing or retro fans. 5/5 stars!","finally a fun driving game to play endlessly, full of cars, a wonderful retro arcade style that winks at the legendary outrun and with a practically perfect driving system and a compelling audio sector, in short, a little gem to buy absolutely.",A great racing title for Quest. It brings you the throwback racing game feel while offering a different take to the flat title porting to VR. Plenty of progression and unlockables to go through to keep you busy for hours and even days. Mechanics feels good and accessible to different types of player. Very solid title overall! Highly recommended to get your racing and drift on while on your VR headset!,"The neat visuals, varied roads, diverse cam viewpoints, straightforward yet clean physics, catchy tunes that excited me, and a coherent concept, not a mess, finally allowed me to genuinely ENJOY a standalone racing game for the very first time! Although I believe there are some areas that could be improvedâ€”notably the absence of vibration effectsâ€”this game undeniably processes immense potential as the most engrossing standalone racing game Iâ€™ve encountered, providing a delightful throwback experiences. Iâ€™m leaving this review in the hopes that the developers realize how much fun Iâ€™m having with this game since discovering it, and I eagerly look forward to future updates."
