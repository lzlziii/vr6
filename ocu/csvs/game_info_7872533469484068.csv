Smash Runner,"ðŸ”¹ Smash & Run in Open Space for the Win! ðŸ”¹ Jump and shoot the asteroids, but watch out for the rocks! * Do you like Subway Surfers? * What about Smash Hit? If yes, then you will love this game! * Smash Runner new idea is just here! * The new VR gameplay is definitely here to shake things up! This game requires focus, concentration and timing, not only to travel through space as much as you can, but also to earn rewards for every asteroid hit.

And I have done so. But, like another reviewer, I am totally mystified about how to jump. Iâ€™ve tried to do it with my body and tried every button. I canâ€™t get past the hurdle at the beginning of the game. Very frustrating. Forgive me if I am overlooking something here. But please someone help.","UPDATE: Yes, it works and I burned some calories ;) Jump and move in real life / walk in roomscale left and right. It's fun for a short time. I played to level 30 but give up and get out, because it's way too easy and the same again and again - no more variety. It needs work.","Finally devs are starting to make great Quest games and this one has my full support! it is a fun, aerobic survival game where you are running in open space, surrounded by asteroids going to hit you! The gameplay is smooth and glitch free. Great, immersive mechanics throughout to keep you engaged. My wife and I played this until the battery died. Cant wait for the devs to finish this one. just needs a bit more levels and scenes or maybe leaderboard and it will be perfect. If you enjoy playing smash hit or subway surfers, this is the closest to that experience on the Quest. I am glad I bought this!",Jumping is fun! You don't need buttons in this game just move in real life and move in the game. Only difference is when you jump irl you JUMP (high) in the game :)
