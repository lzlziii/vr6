Art of Balancing,"Atop the sea of clouds, there exists a garden where the past and present intersect. A space designed to preserve our collective story. But decades of neglect have left the garden barren and forgotten. Now it is up to you to restore our connection to the past by creating rock sculptures that anchor our absent-minded world. In Art of Balancing, you are a rock balancer making your way up a mountain in search of the garden. Along the way, you create rock sculptures. Picking up stones, you feel their weight, hear their voice, and find their balance. A collection of carefully thought out prompts will then guide you to reflect on your past and embed your personal story into the stone.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Narrative, Puzzle, Relaxation/Meditation",English,"7

It's a shame it's so short.,"Rock balancing is an intriguing skill to bring to VR, however in itâ€™s current iteration under little scrutiny, this rock tower falls apart. In an app like this actual physics should be first and foremost, but I was able to build towers that defied gravity and logic. Also, the vocal prompts often speak over one another leaving you with an indecipherable word jumble and very little idea of what goal you are trying to attain. The concept has a lot of meditative potential, I just hope the developer is able to realize it.","I have never tried rock balancing in real life before and am glad that it's offered in VR where I don't have to physically go somewhere and find rocks. The concept of VR rock balancing combining with self reflection sessions using voice recording feels very novel and interesting. There is a sense of tranquility/serene in the gameplay itself and in the virtual environment surrounding the player. I can definitely see myself playing such game to heal/self reflect/meditate/recalibrate. It's supposed to be a slow game with no pressure. On this, for me personally, I still felt that I was somewhat pressured to figure out that preset configuration in order to get that last rock aligned with the white outline. Maybe because I personally have a short temper, I found myself getting slightly frustrated easily when stacking the rocks. I think part of this was due to the existence of the preset objectives that the game was asking me to complete. The objectives were somewhat too *specific* that it made it too much of a puzzle than a meditative experience for me. This being said, having no prior experience with rock balancing, I bet people feel frustration too when doing it in real life. However I wonder if the rock balancers also carry a specific rock configuration/goal in mind when doing it in real life. I wish the objective was more vague(maybe reaching a certain height instead) so that I can just just stack rocks with little to no mental pressure. On the mechanics itself, I really like how rock stacking/balancing feels like in the game. It requires some but not an demanding amount of attention and effort from player to put the rocks on top of each other. I think there is a lot of potential in the self reflection part and the game itself. The introspective moments/questions I raised to myself while playing this game were very valuable and meaningful. Looking forward to seeing more. -Wei from 510","But it runs a bit slow, and the balancing part is hard, although it gives you hints. The payoff is to talk to the machine and tell it your secrets, ala, umm, Where the Thoughts Go (or whatever that app was called)."
