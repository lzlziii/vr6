Very accurate once you get familiar with it. I rest my right hand in my left forearm. Different clay shooting options. I like the Plate invaders. Storm is fast paced. I‚Äôve learned to shot without the sights to keep up,"Lovely, relaxing game! Some beautiful courses! I especially like the sweetopia style one, reminds me of being in walkabout mini golf! Love that this is not an easy game, and they have leader boards to push you on Especially like the wave option! Great for practicing your aim!! Great little app and at a very reasonable price! Really addictive game Not sure who rated this a 1 star ‚≠êÔ∏è they obviously have issues aiming a gun üòÇ 5 STARS ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è","Gteat and fun game, but not that easy as the graphics could suggest... Quite demending and be assured your hands will get sour of holding the gunstock up. Also pigeon physics are spot on. Love the modes in the game, so it does not getting boring after short time. Sound of the gun could be improved IMHO.","I wasn‚Äôt expecting much from this game at all but I‚Äôm hooked! The graphics are what at first had me thinking this was going to be a try it once and let new vr users try when they come to visit game‚Ä¶.WRONG! The shooting mechanics and accuracy are done quite well. It‚Äôs easy to play yet difficult enough to be very competitive and addicting! There are a variety of fun courses and modes so it doesn‚Äôt get monotonous. Leaderboards for all difficulty settings is a nice touch üëç. All in all this game is everything I‚Äôm looking for in something relaxing or competitive as strange as that sounds. It does have a hot seat option which is very nice to see as there aren‚Äôt all that many games that allow multiple users with one headset. I would love to see a normal multiplayer option in the future, I think it‚Äôs begging for that! I know there are a lot of gamers out there who don‚Äôt like the violence associated with the majority of gun games so if that‚Äôs you, definitely give this a try! A few other suggestions- The sound of the gun could be better. It‚Äôs not terrible, it‚Äôs just not a shotgun. It sounds more like a 22 rifle with earplugs in. Give it some bark and some kick! This would greatly improve the immersion factor! Also the hits should be a little easier to see. Add a bigger cloud of dust or haptics or something, it would make a big difference! So all that being said this as a great affordable game that anyone should enjoy! Give it a try especially if you want a game with endless replay ability for the same price as an overpriced cup of coffeeüòÇ‚Ä¶.no brainer. WELL DONE DEVSüëç","This is good fun, pretty tricky to master but rewarding once you get the hang of it. Would be amazing if you could play with friends and chat at the same time. A gun calibration would make it much better too as the placement of the gun is a little uncomfortable for me. Other than that this is a nice chilled game and will be playing lots more!"
