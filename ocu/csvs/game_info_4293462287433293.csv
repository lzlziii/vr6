VR Club Live,"Tropical island during sunset with event decorations and two music scenes, one just above water and second in caves under erupting Volcano. Dive into world of wonders and enjoy your stay. Complete daily quests to earn rewards, customize your avatar and uniquely identify yourself at the next generation concert. Innovative solutions like hand tracking, 120Hz, haptic feedback, various effects and interactable items are already implemented in beta. Multiplayer works with up to 20 people in one club instance and is created based on location... so you can meet someone from your area! Full body avatar and fingers, music, voice chat, effects from a VJ spot - special area where you create a visual spectacle for others, all these elements are synchronized with everyone in the club. To have more fun there are dance games and activities, one is about repeating movements of person who started the event, other is dance battle 1vs1. After all that fun you can ease your mind in beautiful rest area.",3+,"Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Hand Tracking, Gamepad, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Music, Simulation, Social",English,1.396,Xrcoo,XRCOO,https://vrclub.live/,"Feb 28, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4293462287433293/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4293462287433293&r=1, https://vrclub.live/privacy-policy/",976.3 MB,Is online streaming still working,"Is this app perfect no! However, I really love the vision behind what the devs are striving for. You instantly feel you are at a beach club. The only reason I have not given five stars is they need more events for different time zones other than that - well done team","I love this app, great playlists. Brilliant interactions and very immersive. I would love to be able to add in my own playlists. This application has alot of potential! Well impressed! In the future I would definitely like to see us be able to log into an account to personalise and save our avatars, add our own playlists and hold private rooms. Keep up the good work VRCLUB!",From the moment I came across this App on Sidequest (almost 2 years ago) I knew it was going to change how I hang out with friends during the Pandemic. From exceptional graphics to Bhaptics Tactsuit support the developers have taken their time to listen to the community and polish the experience. The music is always bumping and the party is always swinging ! I am super excited for the future of VRClub!,"This is an awesome idea, too bad abou timezones so it's difficult to attend the parties , but loved the concept ."
