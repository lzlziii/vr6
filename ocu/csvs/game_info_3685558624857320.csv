Tavern Tales: Tabletop Adventures - Demo,"Tavern Tales: Tabletop Adventures is every tabletop enthusiast's pipedream made manifest. It gives you all the things that you know and love about traditional tabletop games, as well as giving both players and DMs tools that couldn't possibly exist in the real world - creating an immersive online TRPG experience like no other. Jump into your own personal tavern that’s stocked to the rafters with all the miniatures, dungeon tiles, scenery, and set pieces you could ever want. Take a break from the story over a round of ale, or have mug stacking competition. Use a range of tools that make building and maintaining your world take minutes, not hours, and most importantly - get lost in your very own fantasy world. Come together, role dice, slay goblins, and tell stories that live and breath like you do.",3+,Multiplayer,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Adventure, Narrative, RPG",English,0.5.3,Studio Shinto,Studio Shinto,https://TavernTalesGame.com/,"Apr 4, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3685558624857320/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3685558624857320&r=1, https://taverntalesgame.com/privacy/",445.6 MB,"I recently tried out the demo for Tavern Tales, a table top RPG VR game, and while the concept seemed interesting, I was disappointed to find that there was no demonstration or tutorial. As someone who is new to VR gaming, I found myself lost and confused with the controls and gameplay. It was frustrating to not have any guidance on how to play the game or what to expect. I think the developers missed a huge opportunity to create a more welcoming and engaging experience for new players. Without any sort of tutorial or demonstration, I can't imagine many people buying Tavern Tales or playing for very long. Overall, while the concept of Tavern Tales may be intriguing, the lack of a tutorial or demonstration makes it difficult for new players to get into. Unless the developers add some sort of guidance, I don't see Tavern Tales gaining much traction.","I think that this would be incredible, it’s just needs some work and expansion, maybe even modding tools, after all imagine putting dungeon alchemist maps or hero forged tokens into a vr space",I have horrible stick drift on my left controller so the only way that I can play games is if I'm able to switch locomotion to my right controller but I don't see a setting for that anywhere.
