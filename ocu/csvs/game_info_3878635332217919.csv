Key Features: - Player vs AI. - Two player MP competitive mode. - Arcade mode with 10 SP mini levels. - Detailed and immersive environments. Experience the solitude of the moon or the adrenaline - rush of a game or two on top of a skyscraper! - Accurate physics based gameplay mechanics. - 8-Ball Pool (Blackball) rules currently implemented. - Additional bonus game modes. - Binaural 3d sound system. *(feel free to join the Community Discord channel to find other players and schedule MP match with them https://discord.gg/ZGAHEuA )",7+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Casual, Simulation, Sports",English,2,Frozen Dreams,Frozen Dreams,http://frozen-dreams.com/,"Jun 28, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3878635332217919/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3878635332217919&r=1, http://frozen-dreams.com/privacy/",869.9 MB,"I’ve enjoyed this game over the past couple of nights. + A fun mix of two sports + Nice environments + Satisfying potting + Arcade mode a nice extra and fun - Aiming physics over sensitive (especially on long shots - sometimes tough to even line up on the desired ball). - Balls look like they roll (rather than slide). - Some table colours clash with the balls. I’m still glad I spent the £4.49 on it though and I really hope the developer continues to update as I think this game could become a popular game. I’d love to see: * more environments * the ability to put spin on a shot (like, perhaps you could push the thumb stick in the desired spin direction once the shot is locked on). * The ability to move the white ball after a foul. * Single Player mode with different difficulties. Well done to team Golf Pool VR.","You are playing pool (Billards) on the moon but are using a golf club. The sights and locations are very cool! Takes a little getting used to the physics and the mechanics, but once you do it is a fun game.","This would be awesome without A) the aiming mechanism that destroys the challenge of both pool and golf and B) the fact that if you are shooting in or around a cluster of balls, the game allows you to just like up and swing through balls. They made this game waaaay to easy.","Great concept and super environments. So far have only played against the A.I at 8 ball. It is a great experience and the chatter from the robots is fun. However I'm puzzled by the control method. Why have aiming lines which are incredibly over sensitive. In fact why are they even there in the first place, or at least have the opportunity to turn them off. I find on longer shots after locking the aim (which is so cumbersonme to achieve), the angle of the club head bears little resemblence to the direction the cue ball takes which is so unrealistic. Can we not just have a normal putting action relying on intuition only with accurate physics. Also no instructions on the other game modes. Sorry to have to highlight negative points, but I so much want to enjoy this game. As it is, its fun but very frustrating.",Great idea but when trying to aim the stow just Jim’s around. Not even ready for the lab yet.
