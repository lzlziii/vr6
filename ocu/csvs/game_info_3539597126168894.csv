Dungeon of Nekros,"This is a one level demo for the upcoming full game to be released in late 2023. You're alive again...but only for an hour! Temporarily resurrected from the dead, you find yourself in a musty old crypt, buried deep in the bowels of a dark & mysterious dungeon. Your only chance at becoming permanently alive again is to embark on a quest to retrieve the Necronomicon - a terrible & forbidden book desired by the one who resurrected you - Nekros the Necromancer. Discover treasure, fight monsters, & solve the mysteries of the Dungeon of Nekros in this amazing RPG by Hidden Realms.",7+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Horror, RPG (Role Playing Games)",English,3.22,Hidden Realms Studio,Hidden Realms,http://hiddenrealmsvr.com/,"Jul 14, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3539597126168894/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3539597126168894&r=1, https://hiddenrealmsvr.com/privacy",757.2 MB,I was playing this game for a while and it was fun up until my weapons dissapeared i dropped my sword to interact with something and it vanished then my wand disappeared while i was climbing it was nowhere in the room i was in and i ended up having to surrender to the enemies because i wasnt able to kill them. This happened multiple different times. Please fix this. Other than than i had an overall enjoyable experience and would love to see more content.,"I do not know if it is me that is just stupid, but have been all over the map at-lest 2 times but canâ€™t find the blue book. I have tried to open every door I was able to find but there was nothing there?","It's a bit boring not being able to skip dialogue, but other than that it's a great proof of concept. It'd be cool to see where this game goes, you don't see RPG games on vr that often and I think this was pretty fun. I hope to see a story in future iterations.",This game is a lot of fun. It's easy to get a hang of and there are lots of different weapons to find. The world is very immersive and always keeps my attention.,"First, it's amazing that a lone dev could create this. I cannot WAIT to see what it's like completed, because it's a blast so far. Frustrating at times since the holsters aren't working for me, so it's a lot of scramble to drop weapons, try things out, then look for them on the ground again, but it's fun! Easily my favorite game so far!"
