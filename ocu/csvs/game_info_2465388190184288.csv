To the cost of the game. I got about 2 hours of game play before I had done everything. More than 2 boats should be in standard version More non competitive challenges should be there. This would be easy to do","If you want to learn and try sailing ‚õµÔ∏è this is just a great game simulator! I wanted to try this game for quite a while and yesterday I finally did and liked it so hard.üëç This is an absolute must-have title for anyone who loves the wind, is already sailing in real life, or has never been but always wanted to tryüí®. The game offers excellent physics, various locations and boats as well as great training and explanations of everything you need. It‚Äôs just a really great product and authors care about it!","Sailing with this game is a good way to relax, but the over focus on racing and competition does detract somewhat from the experience. One star because all games that lock features behind a monthly fee suck and get 1 star.","The sailing physics are great, but the whole concept is totally ruined by the money grabbing add ons and passes. Almost cost more than a RL boat.","What happened to Daily Race Practice? I need to pay $100 now, no more free racing?"
