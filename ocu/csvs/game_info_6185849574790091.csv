There will be much much more added to the game but here are a few of the features currently in the game - Explore a stunning stylized world created by award winning VR developer and artist, Justin ""Tab"" Rosete. - Physics based combat that allows you to block/counter enemy attacks. Enemies will also attempt to predict and block player attacks - A large range of weapons, including a katana with a working sheath and throwing weapons. - Interact with and recruit NPCs to help you fight. - Collect friendly yokai monsters to help you in battle - Search randomly spawned chests for money, weapons, equipment, and other items - Use your money and ingredients to purchase items from shops - Unlock and decorate player homes. - Meet interesting NPCs and complete quests for them to advance the story and unlock new areas and quests. - Fishing (probably different than what you're expecting but a lot of fun) - Intense volumetric blood effects (can be turned off in settings) - Two original soundtracks, drum 'n' bass and Lo-fi (player may chose if they wish to hear tracks from one or both albums)",18+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Action, Fighting, RPG (Role Playing Games)",English,0.6.4462,Tab Games,Tab Games,http://www.tabgamesvr.com/,"Mar 18, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6185849574790091/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6185849574790091&r=1, http://www.tabgamesvr.com/privacypolicy/",2.33 GB,"Devs, you’ve definitely got a great idea here, but it’s not there yet. The physics don’t work at all and it’s buggy as hell. Found the game to be extremely frustrating for those reasons. It’s certainly not ready for the huge price tag. Perhaps a free version while it’s still in its early stages? Regardless, For some reason, I’m not able to get my money refunded. Please fix.￼","- The combat feels alright; but all the other physics interactions do not. Especially sheathing your sword, ESPECIALLY. - I like the artstyle but the current execution looks like a mish mash of pure glitchiness in the town mainly. This is probably just a product of foveated rendering/reduced draw distance on the Quest, but you really can't help but notice it. - The music is GREAT but it needs dynamics; walking through a barren empty field while listening to some crazy battle music, just kinda kills it. - $30 is crazy for this title. I know there's a demo, but I would deeply suggest lowering the price a little, and putting it back up to the full 30 once the game seems complete and polished enough. I'm glad you at least provide a demo; but in it's current state, I still don't think this is worth the price. I'll put my faith in and not refund this; let it marinate for a while and hope it grows into something truly great.","First, the art style is amazing it feels like youre actually in a manga, physics need a little polish but overall fairly good, when unsheathing the katana it actually slides, its not just a pop and its out, locations look pretty good, although the outside areas sometimes feels a bit empty, enemies are good but i think the animations are a bit fast, you can slice them in any axis, which is sick, not many games have it, weapons feel great most of the time, blood effects are also really good Slicing does need to be improved a bit tho, it sometimes feels like a blunt weapon, stabbing feels great Overall a 9/10 game, needs more attencion","This game is very fun. It has very fluid combat with a metroidvania gameplay loop. Teaming up with ally characters is really rewarding. The music is really original and catchy. The art style is unique and beautiful. This is also the best use of teleportation based movement I have ever seen. Using teleport to jump and dash is a unique solution to a standard vr gameplay mechanic that normally bothers me. This game is early access so it has crashed on me twice, but thankfully I did not lose much progress.","This game is very fun there are some bugs, like the game crashing, but however the game has a few missions, very fun weapons and followers (and a dev that actually listens to the community) this game also perfectly fits the theme of the game too."
