VRflow A320,"- This is the individual/student version of VRflow - VRflow A320 is the interactive cockpit procedure trainer for pilots. Train procedures in training scenarios that incorporate detailed aircraft behavior including sounds, instruments and cockpit layout. VRflow incorporates numerous features for efficient learning and aircraft familiarization, ideal for type ratings. Train with or without visual help, track your errors, see your training time, train with an automatic crewmember and much more. 17 normal procedures and 10 memory items are included. VRflow also contains Explore Mode, where you can explore the cockpit and learn about systems. Explore Mode can be used as a VR cockpit poster with Poster Mode. The individual/student version does not include multi-crew functionality.",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,", Business, Productivity",English,1.09,VRpilot,VRpilot,https://vrpilot.aero/,"Aug 30, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4312061448815665/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4312061448815665&r=1, https://vrpilot.aero/privacy/",Terms of Service,307.2 MB,"I would highly suggest besides the ability to modify or create your own flows, or at least to be updated regularly to match the manufacturer updates","This is great for familiarization with the aircraft, but s others have said, not with your company flows. Developers, please give us the ability to customize the flows ourselves.","Procedures: Generic only… without the ability to cater individual operator differences this will remain as a “hobbyist” tools. For training purpose every single step need to be very precise. Don’t get me wrong, I am not trying to ask you manage all operator’s procedure. Instead you can: 1. Add an in-app pdf reader so user can have their own FCOMs on hand 2. Make the checklists open for editing so users can edit their own version. If better, make a Library function for everyone to upload their airline specific procedures.","This is great. Switches all have labels in explore mode to help you figure out where and what everything does. Downside they have flows, emergency procedures, that are generic. That means you can’t use your own company recommended checklist. If that’s your intent save your $$ and get the demo as a virtual “paper tiger”. Wish you could somehow import or setup a flow or even have a user library of flows you might use that apply to your airline.","First of all fun to be able to sit in a well designed cockpit and go through a ton of procedures. I personally bought it because I thought it was possible to train with a teacher or friends as the video shows. But that is not possible! And you can’t upgrade or purchase a version where this is possible so the promo video is misleading in that sense. Hopefully in a near future developers will release that option as it’s obvious it’s developed already. From that point this would take on a whole new level as one get tired after a while of pushing the same buttons in the same sequence, although there’s an exploring mode that lets you push (not all but) many buttons and gives you information (not super detailed, but if you haven’t flown as pilot you can always google this information for more details). You can’t land but you can take off. So a bit pricey for the stage it’s at but much potential for awesome flight training in a hopefully not to far away future. Would be awesome to have multiplayer, be able to watch eg. YouTube or purchase add on’s training videos inside the cockpit (like real-fishing VR) and it would be nice to be able to talk to traffic control, just a few question options that you would get wrong or right to pass exams or be valuated verbally. The explore mode could also be connected to teaching videos and in general there’s great opportunities for up-sale in game purchases. Perhaps this could also lower the app cost."
