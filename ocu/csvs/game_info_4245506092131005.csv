Install it if you haven’t. Devs please add axes or knives orrr you could make it to where you could hit the enemy with your gun, that would be extra COOOL!! I normally play single player to avoid encountering a wild toddler when he isn’t even old enough to play the game just saying oooh I have a gun cool. Again to the melee ADD IT!!!!!!!! -Thunder","I can’t believe I forgot to review this amazing game. I’ve been playing it almost daily for about 18 months. This is a great arcade shooter. It’s fast paced and a lot of fun. The guns and the kills are satisfying and if you get on with other good players you’ll come out of it with your heart racing. It’s not overly complicated and everybody has exactly the same weapon choices. Great for us older guys who don’t want endless loadout and upgrade choices. You get in and just play. Each game lasts about 6 minutes with 2 teams. After that a new map loads and we all start again! I love it! Great community on their discord too. Come join us! If you see “I Am Legend” in game, feel free to say Hi! Or just shoot the hell out of me! It’s all good!",Idk Why people keep writing these stupid reiveiws saying “well I can’t pick up the mag for the AK-47” Well how bout you fix your controllers INSTEAD HUH PS: there’s bug where gerade explodes right in between there BALLZ and they to no die 2.PS plz add more guns,I just got this and i wish a have a few suggestions 1 ￼ attachments please IM SICK of only haveing a scope on wried guns 2 breakable glass 3 melee 4 full-auto pistols 5 add throwing knives 6 add stims! But over i LOVE IT devs please listen to these suggestions Edit: its been like 4 months and yea i still think they need the things ⬆️ up there BUT more than anything PRIVATE SERVERS im sick of me and my friend having to play in a full lobby PLEASE ADD THOSE,"I own and have played almost every first player shooting games that there are…and a plethora of other good gaming and creative content for my Quest 2. Over the last year, 99% of the time when I put on the headset, I go to this game… and I aim and shoot my heart out. I’ve met and been mentored by some of the greatest players of the game community (that now have bots named after them) and love every minute of it. Whether I’m on opposing teams or on the same team, I always try to rack up the most kills… unless of course I decide my own personal development path in which I’m trying to increase my use of certain weapons or strategic use of new or existing maps..etc…Great game!! I suggest it to every one that I know has a headset!"
