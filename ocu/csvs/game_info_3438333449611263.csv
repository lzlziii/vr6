Slick interface, lots of fun stuff to do, and you can chill out with friends working on a scene! Don't bother getting Tilt Brush, because (at least last I checked) this is more advanced and has multiplayer.","It’s a really great program, easy to create in. The problem lies in not being able to retrieve images in clarity, via casting. Also, the inability to smoothly move around during captures, is kind of off putting. If you like to doodle around and not share, it’s a perfect app.",This would be recommendation for any art style game I've played.i revisit frequently. Well worth the price.,"I love this app, all the choices for brushes make painting more enjoyable. I'm wondering though, how can I record video? I don't see any options in the app nor online yet I've seen uTube video's showing it's possible."
