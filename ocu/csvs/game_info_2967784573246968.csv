And this game really brought it. You can't be fooled by the price or videos of it. It is pretty freaking scary. The jump scares are fabulous. The suspense is awesome. Watching others play it is hilarious! Great game over all!,"There was this game, Affected the Manor, and the walkthrough from 2019 looked really good, scary, nice atmosphere etc. So when I saw they made a ""complete edition"" I decided to get it... Bad mistake.. the first 5 minutes of the 2019 walkthrough were much scarier than the whole ""new, complete"" version experience... Sure it was nice to do all the different choices ending up in different locations... but that was it.... same non scary girl all the time, even laughable most of the time.. Not scary at all, nothing like the first version, way less on the graphic design, the first walkthrough I saw looked really good and really scary.. sad to see they took all that out for the ""complete version""....misleading and a huge letdown... waiting for 7th Guest, which seems way better... And no response at all for any of the bad reviews by the developers whatsoever...","What if there was a story line, and who is the little girl and others in the photos? I want to know what happened and how did it get that way. It has potential like it would be cool if you can go more places like haunted towns or family graveyard or haunted garden or something, travel by boat on a haunted lake and the boat gets bumped or tipped over maybe a ghost sitting on the boat or as a jump scare. IMAGINE GOING THROUGH THE MANOR WITH OTHER PLAYERS. A CO-OP MODE WOULD BE SO MUCH FUN AND FUNNY. Other than that it's fun but everything doesn't need to be demonic. I indeed had butt quacks tho.",This is great but no add ons new routes rooms etc can only be even better...
