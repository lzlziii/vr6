Going into the game I had no idea what to expect or even the names of the characters, but I thought the setting, premise, and screenshots looked intriguing. The intro did a great job of drawing me in, and before long I was having my first virtual drink and cigarette with a Shelby. As the game progressed, I caught myself marvelling at the environments and taking some screenshots to share with others. I also spent long hours Achievement Hunting! Overall, I really enjoyed the mechanics, characters, and story, but that wasn't even the most impressive part... After completing the main story, I began watching the show with my wife. From the VERY FIRST EPISODE, I found myself in AWE as all of the places visited in the show were locations I had walked around in VR!!! It was my first experience like this and it blew my mind. Even the little window in the pub was there, the cigarette packs, the alleyways, the homes and place of business. I thought I may be a little overjoyed, so I had my wife try it after a few episodes and she was also amazed at how detailed and recognizable they were! I keep revisiting this game as consistent updates add even more replayability, but this one was definitely worth playing through!",Ignore all the hate Yes it has its bugs and flaws but what game doesn’t ? As of this moment 1st June 2023 the story may be a little shorter then expected BUT the devs have already posted a year long roadmap which includes FREE story extensions which should lengthen it out If you like the show then you’ll like this Don’t listen to the others who say it’s bad like it’s a complete game … it will evolve and grow but as of now it’s a pretty solid game - I recommend,"This game is amazing, thiers just 1 downfall. If you have stick drift in your controller, you can’t really play because of the teleport moving thing. Is thier any chance y’all could add a option in the setting to turn it off. I’d like to play the new mission and I can’t cuz my guy just keeps teleporting. Plssss",I am about 3hrs into the game and find the mechanics almost unplayable. Very annoying combat mechanics that require ammo cache next to you for all battles. You cannot loot ammo from enemies. You cannot site the weapons. The playable character is mute so dialogue only goes one way. Hand gestures such as using keys and doors is sloppy and needs some work. There is also a weird tips function we’re text appears on screen advising the player about what they need to do to advance. This function seems to work intermittently and without it there are dead ends in the game so when it’s not working you have to YouTube the work around to get past the dead end. The graphics and story line are good and I will likely finish the game because I am a fan of the show and am curious about the story. I am hopeful some of the mechanics will be Fixed making this a very good game.,This was an amazing game soo immersive must have. Just seeing Tomas Shelby was amazing must have. Just adding on do you guys actually spend time writing these responses because If so that’s so cool please tell me in the response. Another thing are you guys going to extend the game or just add people in the open world who you can fight because that would be so fun so basically add people to the open world.
