With the help of his father and his brother, you will guide Dot to his beloved Princess Rune. ● Discover crazy worlds Throughout the escape Dot will encounter various environments, from forests, snow mountains to sci-fi and even maybe a little trip to other worlds. Who knows. Maybe he's an astronaut pig. Maybe he's a super pig that can fly. ● Conquer your skills Unlock a variety of power ups to help Dot throughout his escape, as well as discover new outfits for him to wear that give him extra special bonuses when he wears them. Roll, Jump, shoot and dodge. That’s the way the pig goes. ● Go shopping You can upgrade your power ups in the game using the tomato currency. The more tomatoes you collect while you play, the more you can upgrade your power ups and unlock new outfits for Dot! ● Show off your dance moves You have trotters instead of your hands!
