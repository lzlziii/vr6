Contour,"Contour helps you bring digital art to life. It uses the Quest 2 cameras - aka passthrough - to overlay digital artwork on top of a real life surface to easily create outlines for your art before starting the actual paint job. Whether you're an artist or not, you can create superb drawings like a pro: simply upload PNG files to your Quest using a MAC or PC, resize and place your artwork atop your real world canvas, and start drawing. Important note : as Quest 2 cameras are black and white fairly blurry, Contour really not meant for precise drawing or finishes, and is better suited for sketching and outlining relatively large artwork (e.g. wall painting, signage...) before starting the actual paint job. To import your own artwork, plug your headset to your computer and place PNG files into the `Android/data/com.DDXR.Contour/files` folder. You'll need to restart the app to see the new pictures. It is recommended for the images to be 1024 * 1024 (or above) transparent with white outlines. Please also note that Mac OS users may need a free 3rd party software to upload images on their Quest headset, such as Android File Transfer or SideQuest.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity",English,0.5.4,Dehats Studio,Visible Space,https://visible-space.com/contour,"Dec 23, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6342667652416194/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6342667652416194&r=1, https://visible-space.com/contour",84.9 MB
