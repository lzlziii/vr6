There's nothing like this in the whole Meta Quest Store! The graphics are great, idea even better, but now we will come to the problem. I had only one problem in the whole playthrough of this game and it was that there wasn't any task bars or possible ways to rewind the radio. I was once stuck on the MIR, because I didn't know what to do, so I played the whole 2 part just to hear what they said. So I would love if there was a way to rewind the radio or just open a simple task bar! Thank you for the game and I will be waiting for updates!!","This game has amazing potential. From what I am able to play, there is an incredible amount of gameplay and technical fun to be had. But unfortunately, this game is plagued with crashes. I start it up, crash. I get into the main menu, crash. I start smacking something with my wrench, yep you guessed it, crash. If all goes well, the game is a ton of fun, but it is starting to feel like I’m spending more time trying to get back into the game than I am actually playing it. I don’t know how much work needs to be done to fix the issues, but I do hope it comes soon. Heck even being able to play the first mission will boost my rating from 2 up to a 5. Good luck to the developers because I really hope to see where this thing goes.",Probably a great game but I can’t even play it as soon as I got on it crashed followed by seven more crashes then I got in the first steps level and before I could start the computer it crashed I started browsing the comments and others had this same problem please fix this bug soon Edit the next day I played it it was fixed so it was actually a great game!,"Update: Restarted my quest 2 a few times and managed to complete the tutorial and the 3 mission parts. Yes, there are some severe bugs but I'm so amazed that I can't not give it 5 stars - I mean, there's dynamic lighting, full physics simulation, voicework, and a space ship system! As a wannabe developer, I'm incredibly envious of this experience! My take is similar to what others have shared - amazing graphics, physics is accurate, and gameplay is just downright unique. However, I get serious frame drops whenever I stare at the back of the ship. This became crippling when trying to dock the ship in the docking corridor and adjusting the angle. Because the performance hit was so bad, I could not finish the tutorial without wanting to throw up. Will try again another day but I really want to love this game.",Been trying to play for over a week but still on the totorial. Game crashes so much takes 5 minutes to get the game up then crashes. Looks like it would be fun but I don't know. Going to wait for an update so maybe this issue will get fixed. You might want to wait until it's fixed before purchasing. Will update my review after the crashes are fixed.
