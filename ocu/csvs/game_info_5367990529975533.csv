They intended to find some supplies on the island to repair the boat.But something seems to be wrong, the island is full of bones and rotting flesh.

I was experiencing a (possible) glitch during voting time, that i couldn't hear anyone talk. Is that supposed to happen? I'm not sure. But good job, and keep up the good work :D","Offers 2 modes of play and an excellent lobby/waiting experience. The first game mode is an escape the island game mode where you'll do repairs and try to vote out the killer/s before time runs out called ""Classic"" and the other mode is called ""Hide and seek"" where you are simply a survivor or the killer/s. The lobby keeps you entertained with kayaking, trampolines, ring toss, jet packs and more while you squad up with up to seven people or AI to defeat your killer/s. Not Me is a fun VR experience either for PCVR or Oculus Quest 2",This game is awesome and I recommend u try this game put with your friends and I guaranteed u will love this game i played with a girl name clover and she showed me how to play and get the hang of the game 10/10,"Not Me is a wonderful vr rendition of werewolf. It expertly combines the need for hiding your motives with your words and actions, and the need to move through the virtual environment to complete the objective. The community has been great fun and the devs have been excellent in providing for the players. Overall, Not Me is definitely worth the buy and time"
