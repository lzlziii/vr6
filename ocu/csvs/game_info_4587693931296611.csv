The devs have overhauled most of the game, making the levels more fun to play, the interactions easier to use plus some new additions. The glider in particular is fun to use :) Would love to see more levels that are slightly less linear/have more than one path to take. They don't have to be completely branching paths but having an option of an upper/lower/side path you can switch to is great. Some of the newer levels kinda hinted at this direction and those were always the most fun to play.","Nice simple runner game, as you go through controls aren't hard, good mechanics. For the ""randomly created levels"" just do the final tutorial repeatedly I guess... The jump is a little wonky, but other than that I have little to no issues! I enjoyed!","Great game, loved learning the mechanics! Had a couple issues with jumping on occaision where it would throw me off way to the side when um trying to go straight, but for a free game this is amazing. Please add levels, would happily pay for this type of content :)","Love the game play and mechanics of the game, only problem is after I finish tutorial I can’t find a panel to play randomly generated levels only level editor. Also possible idea is once you get to a certain point a boss fight but still endless. As well as a score so we can try to beat our last point. Otherwise great game can’t wait to play more!","Full Video Review - https://youtu.be/xKbJs8USEzs Void Ninja is a procedural free runner in the sense you are always moving forward, moving or tilting your head left and right, ducking and weaving around blocks, using Katanas to Slice enemies, a gripping and sliding motion to turn, two fists thrust downwards to jump, hitting buttons, walls to climb or slide along, hook shots to swing on, bullets to dodge, and my personal favorite a Bow and Arrow to get those pesky far away baddies. While I had a little bit of a struggle to get used to the jumping and turning motions, once I got a better hang of it I was able to get through the levels with ease. Visually the title looks rather basic with some nice retro appeal, the enemies are untextured and there is well, a lot of yellow. If your willing to make your own levels this has serious excite bike level editor vibes too and I can easily see someone spending hours making the perfect levels to play. In conclusion I found the title to be entertaining engaging and offering a fair level of challenge with checkpoints. I enjoyed using all the different elements of the game especially the bow and the hook shot. It has great music, a cool level editor and because the levels are randomly generated it offers good replayability. The aspects of the game I wasn't so hot about really came down to frustrations getting used to the turning and jumping parts. I also found the graphical style to be lacking enough variety and detail to keep my attention for long play sessions. Its a fun game and I think its worth playing."
