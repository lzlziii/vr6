First not all missions in WW2 happen off an aircraft carrier so why don’t you make some missions off a airfield also this adds onto that airfield suggestion add bombers that the player can actually fly it might not be easy to have control over the bombs but I think you should just add a button in the cockpit to enter the bomb sight and if you pull a trigger the bombs will drop if you do that it would make the game that much better,This is absolutely one of the best games on Oculus Quest 2. The combat is great and there are many planes to choose from. Another cool feature is you can change the color and logos on the plane to make it your own. Graphics are great! I wanted to be a fighter pilot in real life then developed epilepsy so now I can never fly so this game has given me the chance to feel what it may have been like and it's as close as I'll ever get and I'm super thankful for that and to the developers. If you're into planes then please check this game out and I promise you won't regret it. It does take a bit to get used to but once you do your solid. I thought I would get sick because everyone says they get sick the first time but for me it wasn't to bad then the second day of playing I was perfect and no nausea. 10/10 I hope they end up making another game like this.,"This is an amazingly-good flight combat simulator for VR, with great graphics and stutter-free action (in comparison to games played via PC airlink). It's a little arcadey in nature, but that is probably why it is so action-packed - once you start a mission, things happen thick and fast. Being arcadey, some of the flight physics aren't always realistic (eg I can do rudder-only flat turns at 50 feet to eliminate AA) but that just helps complete otherwise seemingly-impossible missions. As you upgrade to better aircraft, you can feel the difference in performance, and in missions, you can jump between aircraft in your squadron to utilise their different capabilities. One tip - the fast-paced 3 dimensional flight action can lead to nausea for some. My trick is to pretend I am actually in the aircraft, and tilt and turn my head as I move the aircraft about in the sky. If I climb, I tilt my head up. If I dive, I tilt my head down. Banking and turning right, I tilt and turn my head right etc. Thus what I see in the headset is matched with what I feel through the accelerometer mechanisms in my inner ears, and so there is no nausea. Works for me in every motion-based game","I really enjoy this game! It is quite realistic. It's really the only reason I purchased my meta quest. I would like to see a couple of updates on it, though. It would be nice to have the other players' avatars and planes on the carrier so we could check out each others planes and it would pass the time while we are waiting for the lobby to fill up. It would also be nice to put a level filter on lobbies to do away with the new players constantly quitting and causing issues within the game",This game is amazing but it would be a better game if the devs added bombers that you could fly and allow some missions to start on airfields and not carriers and also can u maybe can make a game like this but with modern jets. But great game.
