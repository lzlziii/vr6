SWORDS of GARGANTUA,"Swords of Gargantua is a single and multiplayer sword combat rogue-like that pits you and up to 3 other players against the mighty Gargantua and his army in a series of exciting arena battles. Featuring realistic swordsmanship physics, almost one hundred weapons and shields, artifact power-ups, as well as character ability and item upgrades, traversing the 101 levels of the Tesseract Abyss relies as much on your gladiator skills as it does on your tactics, equipment and teamwork. Summon your friends to battle through the Invite to App and Friend List features and reclaim the world from Gargantua and his false gods!",12+,"Single User, Co-op, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure","English (US), Chinese (China), French (France), Japanese, Korean",2.2.1.40007,Thirdverse,Thirdverse,https://www.gargantuavr.com/,"Jun 6, 2019","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3064046640291676/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3064046640291676&r=1, https://www.thirdverse.io/en/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,2.33 GB,I bought this game and spent countless hours lvling up only for them to shut down the servers and completely remove the game on top of that they don't want to refund the money I paid so I basically paid all this money for a demo of sorts I expect this to be refunded or I will seek out legal options,"This game was once shut down because the developers conceived it as an always online live service game, but it did not pan out, and they needed the manpower to launch their new game....so they made a bad choice which lost them a lot of face from the community. They shut the game down, continued selling it right up until the day it shut down. Eventually after launching their other game they diverted resources to making their old game playable, and they brought this game back... Which bring us to today. The game is back online and the mechanics are fun, but the game is unlikely to see any new features.....and the game is extremely stale, you go through the same dungeon fighting the same enemies who spawn in the same places over and over and over again until you get bored and never play again because there is no reason to come back. It would be different if they retooled the experience to add real meaningful variety. Should you buy it.....it's kind of expensive for what amounts to a tech demo you play intensely for a few weeks then never touch again....but maybe. It is after all very fun and addictive for those few weeks. Really it all depends if you feel comfortable spending that money for a short term gameplay experience",I have been playing this for 2 years but now I have logged in and I have to start all over again all that progress gone I'm pissed off I'm contemplating if it's even worth. Coming back to the game now I've lose everything use to be fun and would work up a sweat,"This is a beautiful and unique game 10/10 master piece to me, but when I tried loading up the game a couple hours ago it had completely restarted me from the very beginning I don't know if this is something on my part or a glitch but if anyone has anything that can help please do",Iâ€™m glad itâ€™s back and i hope it stays this time ðŸ’€probably the game with most satisfying combat and gameplay for me. i hope this and thirdverse in general get more attention
