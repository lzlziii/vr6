Callie's Canine Agility Challenges,"Experience the fun of running an agility course as the dog. Jump over jumps, run through tunnels, climb high on an A-frame, walk the narrow dogwalk and follow the increasingly complex obstacles and courses. Try your best to weave through the weave poles or jump the broad jump. Get a bird's eye view from the viewing stands. Start the timer when you begin and see how quickly you can complete the course. Or you can make up your own sequences using the obstacles on the fields. There are now four courses to try, some easier, some more difficult. No violence, no fighting, good for family fun. More courses to follow in future releases.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Sports, Strategy",English,18,CottageGateArtisans,CottageGateArtisans,https://cottagegateartisans.com/,"Jun 16, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6225169707526582/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6225169707526582&r=1, https://cottagegateartisans.com/privacy-policy",138.1 MB
