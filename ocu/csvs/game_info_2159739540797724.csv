I only got to play the last event so I was lucky to get some good skins. But mostly all the good skins are locked from the previous events. So half of the skins will remain locked.. theirs a section in the map that said new map Coming soon ( 2 years already) and still nothing.,"I am going to start off with the negatives. This is unacceptable for a company to be this lazy with their content. Like they have stuff posted on here that 2 years old. Also releasing late updates that should be been part of the game from the beginning. Overall, its a below-average but decent kart VR game with some levels looking somewhat nice. I kind of wish they went into the ModNation racers route and allowed players to make their own stages, powerups and such. Also, there is only one mode available and its just racing and you cant change the how many laps or reverse the tracks, also not a lot of tracks in general. People need to stop calling this OMG ITS MARIO KART BUT IN VR because its clearly not....","Read my review to save on this game and more! This game is crazy, and has a lot of tracks! Didn't cause me any motion-sickness, but there are comfort options just in case it does. The items you pick up off the tracks are crazy, like the chicken egg launcher, and the bee traps, what the heck! ðŸ˜† Takes a minute to master the driving and the drifting mechanic, but SUPER fun once you figure it out! There are also a few different ways to control your kart, so you can play the game the way to want to play it, be it steering with your hands, or your joysticks. Really unique game I'd recommend anyone trying! Get 25 per cent off this game and more at: beacons DOT ai SLASH justinio (Just remove the CAPITAL WORDS, and scroll to the bottom!)

Faded, grainy, underwhelming graphics. 2. The worst, and I mean the worst anime art style comics for the in between levels that made me sick or angry every time I saw it. Iâ€™d close my eyes and press the button that skips it as quickly as it became available. 3. Repetitive. 4. Ambiguous trajectory and confusing menu 5. Not enough courses. 6. Courses are repeated for different underwhelming missions. Itâ€™s really not for me, but if you think it might be for you, do us both a favor and use my lnk below.
