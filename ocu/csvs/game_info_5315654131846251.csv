Talasnal House VR,"The exhibition of the Ethnographic Museum Dr. Louzã Henriques (opened in 2020) articulates the dimensions of the dominant Portuguese paradigm until the 50s and 60s of the 20th century, corresponding generically to the ""Rural World."" The museographic narrative presented in the exhibition circuit was intended to move away from a representation often associated with the idealization of rural life, either for its emphasis or for the condemnation of its inhuman rudeness. The Virtual Tour is an integral part of this circuit. It allows the visit to a typical house of Serra da Lousã, characterized essentially by its construction in slabs of shale and wood in the jambs, lintels, and aprons. Several specific artifacts are integrated into the house, reinforcing the richness and complexity of some of the numerous human activities in the ""Rural World.""",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Documentary & History, Educational, Exploration",English,1.2.1.4,Fernando Sousa,FSDesign,https://www.behance.net/fernando-sousa,"Sep 6, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5315654131846251/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5315654131846251&r=1, https://privacypolicytalasnalhousevr.wordpress.com/2022/08/02/talasnal-house-vr/",780.2 MB,"Other than the narration not playing in the background (which would have been nice as you explore) it's all quite good. You get to see how the people of the before times would live, maybe you've also been to an IRL museum experience like this, and everything here is good translated into VR. Good graphics too, that's the most important thing."
