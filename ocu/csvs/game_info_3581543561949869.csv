Whirligig is the best media player around and I have tested several players. But the Quest version is lacking support for external devices, network access, upnp, smb etc. Please add this functionality. Then I will give 5 stars. Many thanks..",Need to connect NAS via SMB but can't find if it's even possible,Useless,Unfortunately it crashes immediately on Quest 1,I have tried the other major VR video apps and Whirligig is certainly one of the best out there. The developer is extremely responsive and goes through many lengths to look at and provide potential solutions for issues. I have used the Rift version and the Quest version is pretty solid. There are features Phil is working on that I am looking forward to and I will be a continued customer.
