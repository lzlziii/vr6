Curling One,"Curling One allows you to experience the sport of curling, from delivery and sweeping to detailed strategic planning and execution, in a fascinating 3D world. The advanced physics engine produces realistic curl, effective sweeping functionality, and accurate impact results. All of the basic curling rules are implemented, including the five-rock rule (free guard zone), hog line violations, and removal of out-of-bounds stones. Play against an AI opponent, or with friends in pass-and-play mode.",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Roomscale, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Sports",English,1.0,Hackin' Shack Inc,https://hackinshack.org/,https://hackinshack.org/docs/curling,"Apr 6, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/9443599825653708/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=9443599825653708&r=1, https://hackinshack.org/docs/curling/",440.4 MB,"Physics are excellent, graphics and controls are good, and with its latest update there is now a very challenging set of AI opponents. This simulation is remarkably faithful to real-world curling.","I could play this game all day. If you’ve curled before, you’ll appreciate the responsiveness. Once you get a feel for it, it’s simple and a great way to practice. If you haven’t curled, this gives you a good feel for what it’s like."
