Could do with some settings options. For instance a choice of three card deal or one card deal in solitaire. Played over 40 games with not one win. But for what you pay it’s ok.,"I enjoyed this game but it is still far from being ready to play. I bought it for the Whack-a-mole game mostly. Unfortunately, the physics and the mechanics are still off. My movements and the hammers movements are not exactly correct. I know it's not my headset because I played a different ""whack-a-mole"" game from App Lab that matched up perfectly. You can also swing the club side to side to knock down the moles which is a problem. Should only count if hit from above. The cups game work very well. I think on my first try I made it up into the higher 20s levels. The solitaire game was cool, except it only has the option (that I could find) where it flips three cards over at a time. There should be an option to change that to either one or two card flips at a time. Most of the graphics are still very unpolished.","Sitting at a table in a gazebo playing a wide variety of beautifully crafted games. In solitaire I found the cards a little hard to make out unless I leaned forward. Colouring a group of cards for movement was a bit fussy (to get just the group you wanted instead of more or fewer cards) and involved a step of uncolouring them first to make a correction. And, once all the cards were turned over, not being able to finish automatically, though realistic, felt a bit tiresome.","First, thank you developers for this fun game , I like to support this type of game to get better. Please continue to update this game, better user interface , so it is easy and simply to play. Sometimes the controller is done , or disappeared ? Update the game play with the Quest 2 controller if possible. Looking forward to more update of this game from the developers if possible because it can be fun game to enjoy, please. Thank you"
