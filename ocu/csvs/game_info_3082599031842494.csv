This is not really a first person shooter. Itâ€™s more of a tower defense type game. Even if thereâ€™s no one else on you can play bots or do challenges. Just get it so Iâ€™m not lonely ðŸ˜©,Great game but needs more players online so you should download it,Gem,"This is my FAVORITE game on the quest. Hidden gem for sure. Once you understand the mechanics behind the game there is a TON of replay-ability here. The bots and match settings can be scaled to provide challenges for even the most experienced (turn on modifiers and then use arrow buttons to set them up)! The VR mechanics for this game feel super tight and responsive, and the hero abilities are very varied. It's worth watching the 5 min tutorial vid to get the basics. It's even better and a completely different game when you get some people together to play pvp, but even against bots I find myself coming back again and again to setup challenging matches. Don't let the visuals fool you, there's a lot of game here. Can't believe it was developed by one guy. There's a ton of customizability. so if you don't like how the control settings are (button mappings, smooth vs teleportation, HMD driven vs not, you can basically change anything. The HUD too is super customizable. Supports multiple refresh rates in game as well, up to 120hz. This could be an amazing competitive e-sports game if the right people find it and start making it known. The quest is sitting on a possible gold mine here and doesn't realize it. There was a tournament earlier last year and the battles were pretty intense! Piece of advice, don't start with Azure or FRED, they look cool but their mechanics are entirely different from the other characters. Better to learn the basics with one of the other heroes first, so you can appreciate how those two heroes deviate from the norm.","This game is so good, being the only vr moba doesnâ€™t change the fact that this gives such an amazing perspective on mobas. And then who can argue with the price, Free! Everyone should check this out"
