Love the disco music from the good old days. Wasn't first easy to play, but you get the rhythm real quick. Loved it.","Really loved it, it was very enjoyable",Been playing this game with some friends. Best part is that you are doing real dance moves to pop the bubbles. Rather than just hitting objects. Songs not well known but still great fun to play. Couldn't put my name into leaderboard which would be really cool. With real pop songs this is a winner,"Great idea, fun name, nice environment and cool tracks. One thing I think needs work is the gameplay. Not enough feedback on what I'm doing. Some work on the explosion fx and maybe some sound fx would be nice. Also combos? I'm not sure if they're in there but I couldn't trigger them. It needs to feel good when popping the bubbles. Its almost there but not quite. All in all a really nice game though. Looking forward to see some updates. Can recommend.","Game could of been fun, but the songs are so bad you can't play with volume on...."
