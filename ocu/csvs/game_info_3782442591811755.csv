I prefer a game of horse when on the court. After a few minutes I was getting shots in. I only played solo mode but definitely enjoyed it. I look forward to more solo modes and updates. Even playing a bot in solo mode would be epic... Please keep it up Devsüôå,I love playing basketball so I love this game the shooting isn't the best because I kinda feel like i am just throwing the ball instead of actually shooting but one thing I wish there was is dunking that would be amazing and most of the other things in the game are pretty good,"This game feels like a step ahead from Gym Class into the right direction. I‚Äôm going to make a some points on this game. Shooting-6/10 One thing I hate about shooting in this game is that I feel like I have to just throw it at the basket instead of just shooting a basketball normally with good form. I have a Kevin Durant type shot form that uses pretty high arch and each shot on this is just an airball. I have to use abnormal force for the shot to just make the basket. I think a power booster option should be added that you could boost power to your shot til it feels normal instead of just chunking the ball. Also I think a button to spawn a basketball in your hand would be nice instead of just running to ball racks every single time. Locomotion, Dribbling, Etc.-3/10 This game is really messed up in this category. Dribbling is not in this game, but I‚Äôm perfectly fine with it because it doesn‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôm just going to throw out dribbling due to it not being important. The locomotion is teleportation which is fine, smooth would be much better, but it is at least doable. The problem I have with it is that if you teleport with a ball in your hand then the ball falls out of it. You are also unable to pick up a basketball off the ground which should be added. This means I can only shoot at certain places instead of utilizing the whole court. The button to move should also be changed. Why isn‚Äôt it the left or right stick like Vader Immortal? It is a button right now, and it is sorta clunky. Multiplayer-Haven‚Äôt played it yet Solo-7/10 I have only played around the world, but it was fun. I enjoyed the mode, but it can‚Äôt just be the only mode in the game if it is. I‚Äôm pretty sure it isn‚Äôt so don‚Äôt worry. An issue is that the commentator‚Äôs voice is too quiet, while the crowd (literal jumping chairs) are super loud. Hopes I hope friends can join each other‚Äôs practice courts and shoot like gym class. Needed Additions/Tweaks Power Meter Adjuster Be able to pick basketballs off the ground Move with a ball in your hand Basketball spawner button Option between Stick Teleportation and Button Teleportation Crowd Noise and Commentator Sound Options Holding down the stick to jump then let go to dunk would be amazing Around the world directions, cutscenes, etc. are skippable Wishful Additions Free Locomotion An Assisted Dribbling Option? Three Point Contest An assisted dribbling option is basically gym class‚Äô free dribbling but the game helps and assists you by not making it difficult. These are just my suggestions so far into the game. In the end, I‚Äôm on the fence about keeping the game in its current state as a big basketball fan. I probably will keep and play it, but if it does get updates then I will almost certainly keep it. I may come back and update this review."
