Gravity,"Gravity is a virtual reality music visualizer. As soon as you start, you will find yourself in the middle of an audio-reactive environment where you can switch visual themes and backgrounds, walk around and jump with the teleport. It is a VR version of the same-named audio-reactive app for Windows and Mac desktops. Oculus version looks like a cube, the same as the Gravity concept. You are standing inside. You can switch between different minimalistic sound-reactive themes surrounding you. Another thing you have control of is an audio-reactive geometric form in the middle. Press triggers on both hand controllers to switch between different types of inner and outer things. Press both triggers quickly to get the metamorphosis effect.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity, Music, Space/Universe",English,1.0,StillThisName,StillThisName,https://www.whataboutgravity.com/oculus,"Dec 23, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4226971757401180/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4226971757401180&r=1, https://www.whataboutgravity.com/GRAVITY-Oculus-PrivacyPolicy-Sep-2021.pdf",Terms of Service,383.9 MB,I could easily spend too much time in Gravity. I hope to be able to add more music to this app,"This is the best VR audio vizualiser. I love it with my dopamin ! I think, it could be nice if the developer add more products each months etcâ€¦","It's very fun to just relax and just play around with the settings for some great visuals, but the only thing that I would want is the ability to add your own music","Awesome music, and create visuals, and I just kinda soaked it all in for 45 minutes. This is the kinda VR stuff I like. Dazzle me.",THIS
