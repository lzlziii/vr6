WOW this game looks great! About time we had a sonic/mario type platformer on the Quest. It really does need more titles like this. The environments look great and the camera is comfortable. I love the switch in view when underground. Colours and framers are excellent. Fun and easy for the kids too. I'm sick of all these violent cheap FPS games flooding the Quest right now so this is a breath of fresh air. 3rd person on the quest is still great if bot better then FOS titles and games like this and Moss are brilliant to play. Plus you can play sat down which does help as dont want to be stood up all the time. A great platformer, relaxing to play great graphics. Even at the full price I'd be happy with this purchase. This is now the 1st game I show to people on my quest before I show them the harder titles tonget used to. Excellent game guys. Can we expect more of the same?",Unexpected bliss. Nintendo would do well to emulate this style and put out a VR set. It could be huge. Loved this game and will go down as an all time fav VR game.,Put oculus address first /Perrtti/3652037328256745,"It's been a while since my last review for a game, but I'm impressed by the work the developer's put in to this game. The artstyle and the love for detail is really impressive, a colorful vibrant world waiting to be discovered, this game is inspired by Mario platform games, a good formula for fun. Thechnically this game is really is something, stable frames per second and the crystal clear visuals in high definition are very impressive, great draw distance, other developer's should follow this example. You need to see this for yourself. This game can also be enjoyed seated, as a VR veteran I do need some relaxing games, which can be enjoyed from the comfort of your couch. To the developer's: Could you kindly add an easier ""Kid Mode"", instead of 3 Hearts 5 hearts and if you stand still they recover (like in this other great game :)) and also in this mode, instead of losing a life when falling, how about losing only a heart and respawing at the last non moving platform. Accessibility is very important if you want to build a user base. Another wish would be, could you assign a a analogue stick for camera movement which recenters when let go and a option for camera distance, this would make this great adventure even more impressive. Thank you for your time reading this"
