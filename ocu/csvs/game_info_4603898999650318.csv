Then the game shows you some quite original mechanics. It has a mobile base!!! I love that! The puzzles are very well done and their difficulty is balanced. In short, a lovely experience.","Vanishing Grace is an endearing and enjoyable adventure game. As some have pointed out it might feel a bit rough on the edges, but for me that only happened at the beginning -the tutorial / onboarding doesn't feel very polished and you might jump some steps or get lost. But don't let this deter you from playing this experience, once you get the hang of it you are on for a treat. The narrative of this game is strong and the story is captivating, I like the hand drawn style and even the mini games (now I want more boomerangs in VR games!).","A great narrative adventure with some interesting mechanics, and worth the price to enjoy several hours of puzzles and misteries. Some of the interactions seem like a missed opportunity, but some hidden gems and nice touches do compensate for those, specially at this price :)","The game is an interactive road movie with fun puzzles, very immersive and with a beautiful artistic section, containing an amount of details that shows that it has a lot of care behind it. A very humanistic story, you spend a lot of time in that craft ship where little by little you know the story of Grace and Joel, with a soundtrack that accompanies the development of the story very well. It is very much worth deepen into its world, his travel conveys a beautiful peace and loneliness.","Very fun fame, with many puzzles and fascinating story. You can explore a new world while you pilot a truck and tackle a variety of challenging puzzles to progress through the exciting storyline."
