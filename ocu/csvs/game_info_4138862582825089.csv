DvG: Conquering Giants,"Prepare for the ultimate battle against the notorious giant. DvG is an imaginative twist on the classic story of David versus Goliath. In this epic virtual reality game, YOU are the young shepherd boy on a journey to protect your sheep from the dangers of the outside world. You better be quick on your feet because there are lions and wolves and bears nearby! Armed with a simple yet powerful sling, you’ll face challenges around every corner. They are sneaking through green pastures, lurking in the woods, and prowling in caves. If you defeat these foes, then you just might find yourself on the battlefield in the Valley of Ellah. There Goliath has threatened to destroy your family, lands, and nation. IF you can beat him in one-on-one combat, you will save them all. Can you sling your way to victory? Are you a ""mere"" shepherd boy, or are you a GIANT SLAYER? DvG is brought to you by VLB in collaboration with Virtuous VR Gaming and Immersive History.",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Documentary & History",English,1.3.4,Immersive History,Virtuous VR Gaming,https://DvGtheGame.com/,"May 12, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4138862582825089/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4138862582825089&r=1, https://dvgthegame.com/privacy",1.94 GB,"Everything about the game from the way you move to the way you use your sling really makes you feel fully involved. You're not just playing as David by moving a joystick, you ARE David by pumping your arms and swinging your sling. The whole thing feels so intense and satisfying as you master the mechanics and defeat your enemies.","Just started learning the basics and already it's a great game. Attention to detail is GREAT!! (stone hits tree and chips of some bark). Wolf steals one of the sheep, sheep cries for help and makes you 'want' to rescue it from the jaws of its attacker, just the same as if it were one of my own pets. I look forward to seeing what unfolds as I continue experiencing what David would have experienced during his life upon this earth. This is a very unique experience that I highly recommend. May we see more to this type of game available. Well done team.",DVG is a great choice for a video game adaptation. Protecting your family and your people. Standing up to overwhelming odds is something that keeps the kids attention. The game mechanics took a bit to get used to but most people are not used to using a sling so it was fun to learn. The kids enjoyed watching each other play and got to know a familiar bible story from a new perspective. Wish there were more games like this.,"DvG is a got to have in our families oculus library. It’s a fantastic, fun, and educational game. The leveled are progressive and get harder and harder until you have to slay Goliath. The sling motion feels natural and you get the hang of it quickly but for the younger folks there is a nice sling shot motion that is fun to play. Great game and totally worth it in every way!"
