CYBER TENNIS,"Enjoy tennis even more with a natural swing by using the controller as a racket. Experienced tennis players in particular will enjoy the very realistic handling. Play in your own style by making detailed adjustments to settings such as player height, ball position, and grip. Strong players can be cultivated by training computer characters. The characters learn through AI, so please develop your players as a great trainer. In addition to network matches, spectator mode enables nearby players to watch the matches. Not only the person wearing the VR goggles, but those in the vicinity can also share in the excitement.

It's hard to plan your aim using Air and guessing the right moment to click the trigger to represent a hit of the racket on where the ball is at that moment. I want a tennis racket in my hand to serve and to hit the ball. Also neither internet nor local network mode works. Me and my wife with x2 Oculus quest 2's and seperate accounts and using the same wifi network could never see each other. We are requesting a refund, will repurchase as soon as this becomes a normal tennis game with rackets in hand and such. Currently the game does me and my wife no good as we like multiplayer games, but we are Looking forward to the future of this game.","The game feels a bit too arcade-style at first, but it's actually pretty realistic once you adjust the settings correctly and get the hang of it. I'm now hitting shots like I would in real life and it's very satisfying. Drop shots and lobs don't work well, but slices and top spin are spot on. Very fun. The biggest issue is that I only seem to play bots in online mode. Maybe there's just not many people playing so I'm unable to match with a real person? Or maybe it's just no supported to play another person in real-time?","i tried this game many times to get into it, but always failed. It's nice to look at, although the menus and graphics are totally confusing and just too colorful. Exactly the opposite what you learn if you are a designer of GUI or anything similar. But apart from this the gameplay really isn't for me. There is no physics build in which comes even close to real life tennis. The ball feels feather light and flat and flies way too fast. In addition to this there is no autorun, so if you don't move with your stick on the court you will be teleported near the position where you can return the ball, but there is no way to react in time for a decent return. It feels more like lightspeed ping pong than Tennis. Regarding realism and physics First Person Tennis is miles ahead and will hopefully be released for the Quest 2 soon.","Update - 17-FEB-21 I had another go last night. I can see that the dev has updated as they stated they would on the 14th as the annoying text bubble that kept popping up has now been removed. I wanted to say more but I've run out of allowed characters. I've upped my stars... These are my initial impressions of Cyber Tennis on the Oculus Quest. The game has a number of issues which make me question the £10.99 price tag. It used to cost £2.99 on the Oculus Go and £5.99 - £7.99 seems like a more realistic price for the game on Quest as it is now. Remember you can get the very best VR racket sports games for about the same price as this game currently costs. The English used in the game is awful and instantly makes the game feel cheap. Lots of mistakes. There's too much random text showing up and speech that you can't turn off, particularly from the opposing player. You can turn off either all the speech or none. So you lose the audio for the scores etc when all you want to do is no longer have to listen to your AI opponent talking nonsense. There's a maximum of 10 characters for your gamertag which means I couldn't enter mine fully. For some unknown reason your AI shadow is coded to walk in front of you all the time when you're in the lobby changing settings and setting up matches. The gameplay itself is average and feels highly scripted. You either time your shot perfectly or you don't. There doesn't seem to be much in between. No complex physics here that's for sure. I'll update my review in the future as the game hopefully improves. In saying that it's been out so long on Go and it's still in this state that I'm not too confident that will happen. I'd give it a 2.5 out of 5 if I could. It needs a lot of work to be worth £10.99. The lack of a really good tennis game on the Quest is the only reason this game will get any non-refunded sales which is a shame as other much better tennis games exist on PCVR and will hopefully make it onto the AppLab soon.","Update to Devs - I have tried every way suggested, it just does not find a player. My wife and I are in the same room, sharing the wifi. I create the room, choose ""local"" and ask her to search but it never finds me. She tried it to. Multiplayer just won't work. Hopefully this gets fixed. I like the game well enough to keep it, I just wish the multiplayer aspect worked. Update #2 I updated this experience to a 5 star because even though I can't get multi-player to work, I am really enjoying the game. It has tons of features and I am enjoying playing doubles with the A.I. for now. It is very well done. One other thing I'd suggest is getting rid of the dialog boxes, they are awkward and clunky and after a while, annoying. Also, the load in screen when you zoom into the lobby. That is very disorienting and might make someone with weak VR legs sick. My wife almost had to leave the game before it started. It went away quick, but I don't see a reason to have it. Just a suggestion. Good job so far. Fix the multi-player! Original Post I have played a different Tennis game in VR and wanted to see how this held up. This is a solid game, the mechanics feel good and it seems to have loads of features. There are a few mistakes in the instructions and the dialogue, but nothing terrible. I enjoyed playing the singles and doubles matches. My issue is that I purchased this to play against my wife and we can't seem to play against each other, just random matches. That's sort of pointless as I should be able to play with friends and that doesn't seem to be the case. Dev's, i'm hoping you can tell me i'm wrong. I do hope more folks pick this up so the Devs can continue working on it. I was pleasantly surprised. Another request is to have the Ethan character not be so close when the game starts, he blocks the menu for a bit and there is really no reason for him to be standing there in my opinion. Just a suggestion."
