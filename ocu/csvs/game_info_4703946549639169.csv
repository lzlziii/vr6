PolarDread,"PolarDread is a horror game inspired by games in the Sit And Survive Genre that takes the concept provided in the game and flips it on its head several times, throwing the trailer into tense situations where they will need to act on their feet to avoid bloodthirsty mascots in a winter-themed resort. Hide under a desk from a massive mechanical bear, throw objects, or even the mascots themselves, close doors, vents, and keep your barring until the clock strikes six.

My hands were shaking at the end of every night. And I read reviews that it was too hard, and I disagree, I took like max 3 tries a night. The game is fun, the animatronics design is awesome, and had some genuinely scary moments. I had a hard time pressing the button to start the night due to how stressful it is, but I had fun non the less. The ending to each night is so rewarding, and the power never really seemed like a burden. I had a blast with the game, I recommend.","This game is amazing and I love playing it, I got my oculus not so long ago and a free horror game is just, yes. I loved it so much and I screamed like a girl when the pink head on the wall started shaking and talking 192839390292818383937/10.
