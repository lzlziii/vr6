So here is my review. To start off I just love how it is actual racing unlike other games where it’s mixed with bunch of other crap. This one got my attention quick when I was testing games and I immediately saw that it was free so with out hesitation got it immediately. I had low expectations bc it was free and in app lab, Bit I was utterly amazed on how well everything went when I played this has most likely the best realistic driving than any other racing game. I also love that there is options for everything like color of your car, type of track, what place you start in, And even choosing between manual and automatic! This is definitely one of my favorite games and absolute recommend to anyone. I do have one suggestion, it’s just maybe add multiplayer so we can race with friends, but overall a must have game!","In my Opinion, vr speedway is great for vr drivers but there are a lot of stuff that I want them to add like, realistic tire smoke, better car sounds, free car design, different car body. But I think that will come in future updates but overall the game is amazing.",Hey so I absolutely love this game with its great graphics and amazing physics but where is downtown club I understand that you guys are a small team but I feel like y’all forgot about it I swear I love this game but I just want to know when it’s coming,"I was casually playing then it kicked me from the game, so I reopened the game then my hands would not be able to move almost like they were frozen. So I restarted my headset then that did not work so I uninstalled the vspeedway that did not work so I didn’t play the game for almost 2 months thinking that it would just be a bug or something but that didn’t work ether. Are there any TIPS for me to get this game working again I really enjoy it",Vrom vrom…………….
