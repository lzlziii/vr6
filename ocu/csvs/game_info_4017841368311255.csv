It definitely has a high skill sealing, and a good array of weaponry. The only downside to this game is that it is probably the most sickening thing I have ever played. It was so bad that when I first got it, I couldn't play more than a half hour before getting to motion sick that I had to stop. This is mostly due to the way movement and aiming is controlled, you have a smaller cone of fire that you have to aim with your head then outside of that you wave to turn the whole mech. There is just something about that system that causes a lot of motion sickness, and it having a comfort rating of moderate is definitely being optimistic, I would definitely give it the lowest comfor rating I could, but once you get past that it's a great game.",great game. awesome players lots to learn. really helps to have radio coms going on team matches. bot games are boring to me but against a good human player it's awesome. lots to learn. lots of mech classes. I could possibly give it 5 stars if it had more players online all the time. terrific game play,There are some learning curves and glitches occasionally but I enjoy this game and the guys I play with over all the other games I play. I hope the developers don't give up on it.,"If you're watching Gundam or Robotech, or heck one these newer live action films, heck if you're like me and clearly remember Robotjocks (sp) then this is your game. It feels exactly how I would imagine piloting a giant mech would. So, why isn't it perfect? For all of those reasons I mentioned earlier. The single player campaign currently is nothing more than an expanded tutorial and due to bots its completely redundant. I want Front Mission level stories, and am just hoping at this point that the devs are still interested in adding to this game that appears to be a one of a kind experience, at least on MQ2 that I can see. I don't want to be negative, but what's here creates a severe desire for more. It's just that good.",If anyone plays still could you join the fb group. Would be nice to set up groups
