The Last Shark,"For years the shark population has dwindled due to improper fishing practices and illegal trade. Now a gang of shark-fin traders has attacked and captured the last two remaining sharks on Earth, a mother shark, and her child. What lengths will you go to protect and rescue these majestic creatures? The Last Shark is a stealth action-adventure VR game where you must protect and rescue the last living sharks on Earth. Armed with nothing but your two bare hands, you infiltrate illegal fishing operations and retrieve information on where these sharks are held. Will you find them before it's too late?",12+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Simulation",English,0.26,Aperion Studios,Aperion Studios,http://aperionstudios.com/,"Apr 2, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3661952167229743/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3661952167229743&r=1, https://aperionstudios.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,223.5 MB,This game is so weird all you do is identify sharks it’s so lame you should be able to interact with them,"Very unique story which made me really think after playing it. I also really enjoyed the combat mechanic, sneaking up behind people and knocking them out with three hits is really cool and satisfying.","This game has a really good story with fun gameplay and good graphics, maybe a little short but that really doesn’t matter when the game is free, a suggestion would be to ad a checkpoint system and/or a system that saves your progress which would help with glitches or the game crashing so you don’t need to restart from the beginning. Overall i would say that this game is worth to play.",I loved this game so much. I have been trying to find a game like this forever. Me and my Best friend love the ocean and especially sharks me and my best friend try to find vr shark games on psvr and app lab. Thank you for making our day. We would pay any price for a full game thanks for reading.,"Played it for less than 5 minutes before it got stuck completely and had to kill it. This is an utterly bizarre premise, where it is a low res stealth game to rescue mother and child hammerhead sharks that have been harpooned and held by Middle Eastern terrorists. First of all, large hammerheads are very difficult to keep in captivity and certainly this would be impossible if harpooned as they would die quickly. Secondly, the choice of villains is entirely illogical. Why would keffiyeh clad, Jihadi looking people kidnap sharks? The overwhelming threat to sharks now is the huge scale of live finning where sharks are caught and dismembered alive and the maimed animals thrown into the sea to die and could mean this 100 million of these slow growing creatures are slaughtered in this cruel and wasteful manner every year. This is overwhelmingly because of the demand created by the ever more affluent Chinese desire for shark fin soup. I can only assume the use of Middle Easterners is to appeal to the American dislike of 'ragheads' - although these days the Chinese are not exactly popular in the US (or anywhere). There is also sport hunting of large hammerheads, but that is done usually by wealthy Americans, Australians etc. and highly unlikely to employ harpoons. Weird that you have the woke-ish idea of preserving nature coupled with a Ted Nugent ""lets nuke em'"" attitude towards the Middle Easterners who are not the major culprits in reality; so if you are looking for a coherent vision this is not it. Two stars for free and raising the issues with shark fishing - however clumsily."
