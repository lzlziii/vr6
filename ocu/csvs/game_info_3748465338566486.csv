SynthVR,"SynthVR is the synth nerdâ€™s sci-fi fantasy: A modular synthesizer environment built from the ground up for virtual reality. Based on the Eurorack standard and reimagined for VR, SynthVR offers an exciting and accessible path into the world of modular synth music. It comes packed with studio-quality synth modules including oscillators, sequencers, effects, logic and more. If you built something cool you can share it in a heartbeat and if you're looking for inspiration you can surf amazing community patches at random. What will you make today? Mad-scientist-style electronica, ambient drones or hard techno? If you build it, they will come. Key features: - Fully modular signal flow - 30+ synth modules to play with - Easily share and discover new creations online - Control signals run at audio rate, just like real modular - Animate the environment with your sounds - Multichannel audio recording options - Limitless supply of bleeps and bloops",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Art/Creativity, Music, Simulation",English,1.1.1,42tones,42tones,https://www.42tones.com/,"Mar 12, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3748465338566486/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=app&item_id=3748465338566486&r=1, https://www.42tones.com/privacy/",311.1 MB,"My quest Two was gathering dust,, until I found SynthVR,. I've always been into synthesizers and owned a few (SC Pro-1, Moog) . I saw Videos and Pics of Modular Systems but never had a chance to use one. NOw I have my own. 4 stars only because there is so much more potential , and I'll reserve the 5th star for future upgrades (hopefully)","This is properly awesome. A dream modular synth. Full 3-D spatial audio! No glitches so far despite some fairly challenging spatial audio experiments. Though still slightl This will be integrated with my 'conventional' studio...a TOP addition. Thank you, devs!","I'm new to modular synthesis, but it's hecka fun, and it all seems to work as promised. I am a hobby musician.",The stuff dreams are made of.,This is so impressive! I am excited to see where vr goes with music and visual art and design but this is a very solid and most impressive to me so far. The spatial audio speaker placement adds a very interesting element too. Looking forward to learning more with this app. A modular visual builder like jitter in max would just be the icing on the cake with something like this. Highly recommend and has allowed me to test the world of modular synths without breaking the bank.
