Shuttle Commander,"Shuttle Commander is an accurate physics-based flight simulator where you take to the controls of the space shuttle and land it at various real-world landing sites such as Kennedy Space Centre, White Sands Air Force Base and Edwards Air Force Base. Players can also experience the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope from the cockpit of Discovery in a real time launch experience using original NASA cockpit audio and mission data. Finally, you can view some of the amazing imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope which has been collecting data over the past 30 years from 568 kilometres above us.",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Flying, Simulation","English, English (US)",0.64,Immersive VR Education,Immersive VR Education,https://engagevr.io/,"Sep 24, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2557519677620753/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=2557519677620753&r=1, https://engagevr.io/privacy-policy/",1.07 GB,"I am rating this on behalf of the one star rating people. Give the creators of this educational learning app some respect. Sure you can't control the takeoff. But you can control the landing! As an aviation enthusiast myself, sure I do wish that I could have at least tried to take off myself. But it don't matter as long as I still get to fly the shuttle and I'm happy. Thanks for the game / educational app.",When you first play the game it’s kinda fun but you can’t takeoff the only thing you can do is land witch can be fun at first but not anymore this game is not worth 10$ just make it free or 5.99$,I'm not getting any of the missions. I'm only getting the launch and landing missions.,Do not buy it’s a scam just recordings of the spaceship and pictures not even a simulator,Not a simulator . This is recordings of the space shuttle launches . Yes you can look at pictures . Not fly or land .
