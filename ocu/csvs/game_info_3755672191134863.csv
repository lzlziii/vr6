The app provides several beautiful landscapes that invoke a sense of calm. I practice a lot of mindfulness through meditation, but I have never experienced anything like this. Many people aren't aware of how emotions can manifest as tension or discomfort in the body. The Gift gives you a way to become more in tune with your body and provides a way to visualize taking the negative thoughts or emotions out of the body. I had a lot of tension in my neck and upper back, but going through the action of removing that tension actually relaxed those muscles, and I felt a sense of lightness. It was powerful to see the ball of emotion that I was removing from myself growing. It was interesting to give that ball characteristics, color, and movement in order to have some representation of how you are feeling. Getting rid of those emotions paved the way to create and envision a way to heal yourself and provide yourself with positive affirmations. I cried like a baby but felt a great sense of relief after the experience was over. I didn't know what to expect going into it, but it was an intense experience for me. This app provides a safe space for you to do some deep introspection. I would definitely recommend this to anyone because I believe The Gift really is a present to those struggling with handling things like stress, depression, anxiety, or negative emotions. This is my experience after just using it one time, but I'm definitely excited to continue using the app and showing it to others.","The approach in my opinion is somewhat a mix between meditation and therapy. usually in these practices you could be asked to visualize an emotion or a situation. With The Gift the experience goes beyond: it felt I could interact with the objects of my mind, moving them around, feeling them in the space. In a short time I managed to feel relief and be calmer. Looking forward new features!","TLDR: you have to try it for yourself, it’s really good and you get an instant hit of well-being and feel great after a single use. Firstly this is a great app, there are a few really good mediation apps for VR and they mostly tread a similar path, some better than others but more or less the same. So when I was asked to try this one out my expectations were that it would be more of the same, perhaps with a different environment. How wrong I was! This app stands alone, in a space that’s increasingly crowded, The Gift stands out as they have chosen a completely unique path, it’s difficult to describe and easier if you just try it. But for the benefit of this review, rather than focus on teaching mindfulness techniques or helping you build a routine etc, this app is an instant hit of feel good. You only have to use this once to immediately feel the benefits of it, you get a physical feeling of well-being and you get what you bring to it, that is to say the way in which the guided mediation is worded, it’s open enough that you bring your own issues or challenges to it and the app guides you towards resolving them. Seriously I haven’t done it justice by trying to explain it, just have a go for yourself. I also like the personal touches, the first thing you see when you start the app is the dev team and the first thing you hear is the voice of the CEO explaining the purpose of the app, I found this very inviting and really brought across the personal nature of the work and the team who created it, it made me feel more like a guest in a one-to-one setup and I think I got more out of it because of that. By the nature of the small, independent team who created this it’s not without its bugs or issues. For example it doesn’t feel polished to me, the background contrast isn’t quite right so when you are in some of the darker environments (like my personal favourite where you are in space looking down on the earth) you can’t quite see the orb in the foreground and lose some of the definition. The voiceover is a little grating and I don’t feel it’s quite right for the aim of this experience. The actual method of selecting the background isn’t very intuitive, the number of times I’ve accidentally selected a background I didn’t want then instantly been taken into the meditation then I have no way of changing it or returning to the main menu unless I restart the app or continue with a background I didn’t want. These are small issues that will hopefully be fixed as the app moves forward but none of them are deal breakers for me. I’d like to see more meditations - a feeling of progress, day 1-10 etc. This would give more of a feeling of working towards a goal, more replay-ability so you are on a journey rather then one off experience. This would give you that all important dopamine hit and a feeling of achievement rather than a one and done experience. My feeling is if it’s too easy the outcomes won’t stick whereas if you feel like your working towards and building upon something and have earned it, the effects will be more long term. These are just my constructive suggestions though, my overwhelming feeling towards this application is a positive one and I wish the devs well. Just download it and give it a go.","I'm a big fan of meditation VR apps... I have some pretty gnarly ADHD so I need guided meditation or I'm dead in the water when it comes to focusing. Trip, and guided meditation are both fantastic and I thought this would be similar for helping me ease anxiety and stay focused... But man... WTH is up with the voice over? The whole ""point and click me"" thing gets way overstated and I'm going to be completely honest here... The diolag sounds like someone has taken me into their basement, exposed themselves, and is trying to justify they're actions by sounding all divine and spiritual like it was done for my own good in the name of the lord. Made me feel gross like some evangelical mega church gospel garbage. By the end I was laughing hysterically saying ""c'mon are you serious with this?""... I uninstaled but not before making a few friends go though it to see if maybe I was missing something or if it really was as creepy as I thought. The emotions were mixed with only 1 person as dumbfounded as myself. However none of the people I showed felt like it was beneficial especially in comparison to other similar apps with a much better sense of dialog and direction. I will say thanks for the laughs.","I am quite new to VR, so was a bit concerned about using the gift for my mental wellbeing as I’m used to Human interaction, but I’m happy I did. I worked on a deeper problem and was really happy with the general experience reg. The space, the guidance, the sounds etc, but the best thing was that it really works!! Pulling out the negative feeling and getting a more positive gift back from within myself felt so good and very empowering. Since doing the experience I haven’t had the problem to the same degree, and instant lasting change is worth the most in my book. So if you have something deeper you want to work on and want instant results, this might be for you. Thank you to the team!"
