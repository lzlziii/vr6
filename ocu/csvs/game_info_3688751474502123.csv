Cosmodread,"A VR survival horror roguelike. Trapped in a dying spaceship filled with horrors, you must explore, survive, and find your way back to the safety of Earth. Cosmodread features a rich, tense and immersive atmosphere that will make you forget about the world outside the headset. EXPLORE: Search for resources and find a way home. Every run will have you play in a new procedurally generated layout, with random positions for rooms, corridors, items and hazards, and different emergent situations. You‚Äôll never quite know what‚Äôs behind the next door. SURVIVE: Use your own hands to interact with the environment. Open doors, drawers and lockers and rummage through their contents. Collect basic resources, and craft weapons and equipment to deal with both enemies and hazards. FIGHT: Crouch behind cover and shoot at enemies with your crossbow, or set a trap for them to walk into. But remember: ammo is scarce!",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Horror","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish (Spain)","1.0.0.28

This game is all about atmosphere. Super creepy, pretty scary, and can be played over and over again. Try not to read too much online for tips, it‚Äôs very rewarding figuring out things on your own. I was so close to beating the game one round but I made a huge error, and every play through since I have not made that same mistake. Just buy it, you will not regret it!","The price is perfect, the atmosphere is amazing, the graphics are good, not great but not noticed much as it‚Äôs outshined by the atmosphere and incredible sound design and very spooky ambient noises that you periodically hear (sometimes it‚Äôs not just noises but actually something) when roaming among this daunting and dying ship. The gameplay itself is very fun and replayable and is only magnified with the nicely done procedural generation plus plenty of unlockable items that you can craft every run to help you combat the many horrors that you will come across. The monsters are freaky but get less scary with time but even after a few hours and multiple complete runs where I fully explored the ship they still scare me especially with the noises they make and the objectives not being too defined with the gameplay being mostly exploration means that it doesn‚Äôt get stale despite the same objectives very run. Also it‚Äôs made by the same people who made Dreadhalls, another great horror game that I just can‚Äôt get myself to play.",This game is absolutely awesome. It is terrifying but so much fun! I do really wish that there was a multyplayer function as that would be a whole lot of fun. It would make it even better if you could play with up to 2 or 4 people.,"I mean, wow. What an incredible game. From the beginning when I first bought this, I did not expect it to be so engaging as it ended up being. This game fully delivers on dark and creepy atmospheres, tricky audio design built so your always checking behind your shoulder, unique story element design & lore, enemies around every corner, and constant randomly generated ships filled with all sorts of possibilities, so you‚Äôll never get bored. From what I‚Äôve seen, this is the most affordable and terrifying vr horror game I have ever played, right next to Wraith: The Oblivion Afterlife. It is easily seen that the developers had plenty of passion for this game and a lot of fun making it. So if you want to be spooked, look no further than cosmodread.",To get 25 percent üòç off go to lin ktr(dot)ee/megadis count (replace (dot) with . and remove spaces) Subscribe to the deals!
