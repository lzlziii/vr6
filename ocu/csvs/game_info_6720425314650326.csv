This experience, which may seem monotonous in some ways, may give your tired brain a break. If you have trouble sleeping or if your brain is tired, try using this app. This app also includes a rotating view function so that you can experience the app while lying down.

I wish there was a way to drive more slowly though, the car goes too fast in my opinion. Other than that, it’s a very basic experience with little to do and zero interaction.","Simple Relaxing Drive visualizer basically. I think this is a good app if you like to relax with a headset on. Throw this on and watch the traffic pass by for 5 mins as you reach a state of calm, lots of settings to change the speed and look up or down, plus 3 times of day. Not the best app ever but for free I like it. Featured in Oculus Quest Seated Games Video - https://youtu.be/Naxha7wgbDQ"
