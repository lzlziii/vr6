White Hole,"Build and customize your own ship as you want with a multitude of components that will completely change how you deal with all the situations encountered in this unexplored part of the void. You can meet a lot of adversity in the universe and you will need to fight your way out, negotiate with the different powers ruling the place to make the most of the situation, solve some deadly enigmas and decrypt mysteries to learn about the most hidden galaxy’s secrets. Will the Earth survive its ordeal or will it get destroyed once and for all ? That’s all up to you ! White Hole uses the guardian system to build your ship, you need to use a roomscale guardian in order to play the game.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Exploration, Space/Universe",English,1.12,Fenrir CORP,Fenrir-Corp,https://www.fenrir-corp.com/,"Mar 19, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3077559109014069/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3077559109014069&r=1, https://www.fenrir-corp.com/index.php/privacy-policy-2/",631.5 MB,If it sounds fun to you it will be. I really felt like the commander of my own ship at times. Amazing how it can mimick your guardian so great if you have a bit of room to play roomscale. Would be great if the edges could be smoothed out on the spaceship. I tried a few times to have perfect edges on my guardian and I still found components not fitting on the wall completely flat- the other option that makes it a box doesn't use my space as fully as I want it to. Despite that gripe it's still one of my new favourite Quest titles. Hidden gem!,"I ran into some bugs but the developer had a patch submitted in less than 12 hours! Fixed version is an early build and I did need to restart once to get buttons to activate. Most of my earlier complaints (missing text/broken modules/etc.) have all been fixed. Game is only 1 day old on app lab at this point so Im very happy with it so far. Im only pointing this out to set expectations right. Laying out your ship to match your guardian space is the main appeal here, and it is fun to do. There is a no guardian version with teleporting that I haven't tried. I haven't got far into the game yet. You see a solar system out windows that you can place. Stars light the interior of your ship and ships fly around you. You interact with the tech you place and a holo table in the middle of your guardian space."
