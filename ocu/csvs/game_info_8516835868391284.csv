Can't even hit settings. It just keeps saying ""connecting to network."" I tried re-installing but nothing yet. I'm hoping for an update soon. Then hopefully it will be working. The start screen and the music is good...","First, thank you developers for this VR game. I enjoyed playing it because it is easy to play and challenge at same time. Please continue to add more gameplay and new environments , new outdoor colorful location with tree, flowers, birds, dogs and cats too if possible. Keep up the good work.",I thoroughly enjoyed playing this. I liked it a lot better than Ragnarok. Definitely will put this in my rotation of rhythm games like Beat Saber and Synth Riders. Can't wait for even more songs. I recommend this game. It worked my arms! :),I can’t even play when I press something it doesn’t do anything I only stay in the main menu this game is overrated,Unfortunately game freezes right after choosing song. When the Game freezes controllers￼ aren’t even visible and the only thing that I can do is to quit game.
