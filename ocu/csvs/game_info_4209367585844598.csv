I wanted to give the game a chance, but it just doesn’t work without a big room, one that is 6 meters by 6 meters Overall don’t buy it",The racket acts like a ball there is not even movement whenever I try to smash it goes far i almost broke my ceiling bad game DONT BUY!!!!,"Don't be fooled by ""we fixed most of the issues"". I still can't artificially move but most of all, I can't even SEE THE BIRD HALF THE TIME. It just DISAPPEARS when it goes into the air. It's ABSOLUTELY UNPLAYABLE. I won't even get it if it's free. Wow. This is so bad it's closer to a full on SCAM.","I bought this game a few days ago (giving a chance after the other reviews are low) because I needed to practice for my competitive badminton fixture and it is terrible,here’s how: •Low frame-rate. Can sometimes not even track hand power and movement. •unrealistic.The power doesn’t match what you put in real life and the serves are near impossible.Smash shots are not capable to make as the racquet hits based on the angle when it was hit and not if the shuttle can be dragged. •Poor AI. They hit the shuttle milliseconds before it hits the ground every single time.The difficulty levels do not matter as nothing varies. •Requires too much playing space. It asks for a 6 meter by 6 meter playing area instead of adding thumb stick movement. Please DO NOT buy this game. It is not worth £15 and I am so mad with wasting my money on it.","I wanted to give this game a chance, but it's really not worth it. TLDR : Don't buy this game unless the developers fix those major issues and if you don't have a room of 6 meters. Here's some issues I encountered in 5 minutes of gameplay : * Low frame rate. The game is not smooth at all, you can easily see the ball jumping around. It's very unpleasant. * Bad IA. The training bot in hard was terrible, it miss his shot one time out of two. It just stay in the middle and then jump super fast on the ""ball"" (idk how to call it) without any animation. * Not multiplayer. Obviously no one is playing this game. * Poor game design. If it was a free demo it would be ok, but no, it's a 20$ game. The UI is ok, but the in game mechanics is awful. To make a service you have to press a button and the ball just fall in the serving spot, there is no tossing. When the bot serve, there is no animation, so you just see the ball flying and most of the time out of the playing ground. * No locomotion mechanics. I thought a room of 3.5 m would be ok, but no, you really need a room of 6 meters. I think it would be playable with some sort of locomotion. * Obnoxious music. Usually in this type of game there is ambiance music that bland well with the game, but there it's pop music (like Justin Bieber) and I'm sure they don't have the right to play them. Plus there is 4 big displays surrounding with the video of the music. It's very distracting et it probably doesn't help with the frame rate. Sorry for my bad English, it's not my many language."
