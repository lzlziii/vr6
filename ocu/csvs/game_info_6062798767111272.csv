Realms Of Flow,"'Realms of Flow' is all about calming down and drifting away into deep and soothing states of mind. It utilizes a combination of high-framerate stereoscopic 180Â°-video and interactive elements for breathing, mindful listening, playfulness, humming, and frequency entrainment. You can choose from several experiences, each offering a different scenery, general atmosphere and meditative narration. In the Session Timing options you can set the start time and duration for the different guide features: Voice-over, Breathing Guide, Spatial Sounds, Humming Guide, Frequency Entrainment, and Element of Play. Each feature has various settings that you can adjust according to your preferences. For example, the breathing tempo, which affects a customizable visual focus object, can be a fixed user-defined tempo or controlled using your hand or belly movement. The focus of this application is less on giving a step-by-step voice guidance, but on creating small cinematic journeys with a poetic and meditative touch. Realms of Flow strives to offer unique immersive audio-visual atmospheres to provide thoughtful inspiration, evoke emotions, and create interesting, soothing, and meaningful states of mind that will hopefully enrich your palette of being. - Immerse yourself in the infinite Realms of Flow!",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,", Relaxation & Meditation",English,0.9.9.10,EpicScapes,EpicScapes,http://epicscapes.de/,"Jun 18, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6062798767111272/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6062798767111272&r=1, https://epicscapes.de/privacy-protection-rof",3.76 GB,"Excellent new experience from this developer. A beautiful place to chill, meditate, and unwind. The different visual environments, or Flow Space, have been updated from six at launch to nine total now and they are just the beginning of what's in store for you. And, yes, these are stunning visual spaces, more like art pieces. It's when you get into the myriad options available for customizing what you see and hear that Realms of Flow (ROF) shines. Within each Flow Space six main components shape the sights, sounds, and controller haptics you will experience in your session; Breathing Guide, Voice Over, Spatial Sounds, Humming Guide, Entrainment, and Element of Play. The binaural beats section of the Entrainment feature is of particular interest to me. Good stuff. I've been using this app and the binaural beats, in particular, several times a week since the app's launch a couple of months ago. I find it one of the more powerful parts of this app. Binaural Beats and each of the other five components have their own sub-settings, offering a great amount of control over each session. The recently added ability to save the general and sub-setting options saves time and gets you quickly back into the environment of your choosing. In the Session Timing screen you have a number of options for choosing which of the main six components you want to have in your session and their duration. Overlap them or keep them separate. It's as easy as moving each component and lengthening or shortening them along a timeline. It's one of the best general options in ROF. Do you just want some relaxed breathing and Spatial Sounds with no Voice Over? Just toggle on only Breathing Guide and Spatial Sounds, set the duration for each that you want, and voila! Simple and useful. So many things you can tweak - overall sounds, sounds within each of the six main components, breathing visuals - tune to fit your breathing pace, etc. Too many to cover here. Have fun with them or just jump into the default experiences and relax. It's a great ride. I experienced this app on the Quest 2 using good earbuds for the best sound (Yes it makes a difference given the superb sounds in this app.) and I've experienced ROF on PCVR with the Steam version. Beautiful sound and graphics rendering on both platforms with great performance. On PC I'm running an Nvidia RTX 3080 and an HP Reverb G2 headset.","Realms of Flow is, by far, one of the most impressive VR meditation apps currently available--and I've been trying them all since 2016. If you've tried the developer's previous PCVR title ""Deep States,"" you'll be familiar with many of the mechanics employed that aid inducing a meditative/hypnotic state. Specifically, Realms of Flow (and Deep States) both use a similar mechanic to Soundself (now sold only to licensed therapists)--i.e. you use your voice to ""intone"" and that sound is manipulated and fed back to you in a way that impacts your brain. Similarly, Realms of Flow employs form constants, entrainment, binaural audio etc. to create an environment specifically designed to induce an altered state. If you're strictly into traditional meditation then Realms of Flow might seem very odd because it augments familiar breath-work with audio/visual elements not merely meant to aid in achieving a meditative state but to actually induce a different state of consciousness. There's no arguing that the science behind this is legit, effective, and profound. If you dabble in psychedelics/cannabis then buckle-up for a very special experience. If you come from traditional meditation (as I do), have no fear--there's nothing here that conflicts with your practise. Realms of Flow has a ton of options so you can remove the narration (which is great) or tweak the mechanics any way you like. I reserve this type of effusive praise for only a handful of meditation apps. Realms of Flow is a home-run effort by a proven, extremely talented, developer. Even if you enjoy more traditional meditation apps, you really NEED to experience the tech in Realms of Flow for yourself. I own it both here on Quest as well as PCVR. There are only very, very minor differences so don't feel you're ""missing"" anything buying here--the Quest app is awesome. If you made it this far in the review--just buy it. It is 100% worth it even if you're not into meditation.","Incredible quality and detail in both the visuals and sound. My favourite is the one where you are inmidst a thunderstorm, so calming, also with the narration. I can spend hours in there... We need more like this in VR! I'm so looking forward to the additional content that is promised to come!","After experiencing Conscious Existence and Deep States here comes a new meditation app called Realms of Flow. It's poetically beautiful, visually breathtaking, an experience for all the senses through all of its six environments with more to come soon. Marc and the team have done yet again. This is a must for each and every virtual reality headset out there.","Always worth buying an experience from EpicScapes. Big fan of your work, I have purchased all of it on multiple platforms //n00k1e"
