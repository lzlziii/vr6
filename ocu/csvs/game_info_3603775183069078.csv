This game was a lot of fun! There are two playing environments -- a western desert with a train track or a Wild West rooftop. At the moment, I have only played a few missions that were accessible at the start. I had to collect and eliminate as many colored balls as possible within the time given. There are up to four spots on your body to hold four balls of any color (or weapons, depending on the round) to quickly grab the right color to use in the situation allowed. You can adjust both speeds of the balls and the number per round. The round ends if you get hit by any of them without catching or moving out of the way. There are also different playing modes. You have to eliminate identical colors, another where you use blue and green lightsabers or a bow and arrow, and lastly, one method where you have to punch balls of a specific color (depending on your hand color). This game is very casual with a lot of depth to it, and it is a welcome change to something that you can pick up, play for a little bit, and then move on. I enjoyed the game so far and hope it only grows from here.",I am enjoying this game. It isn’t the workout I was expecting but much more a fun and relaxing mental challenge. It is easy to lose track of time as I try to keep moving I up the leader board. For an app lab game it is well polished. I like the main game better than the more advanced levels but none the less they are all fun. For $3.99 it’s a great value for hours of fun. Support the developer and have a blast. If you are thinking about buying the game just do ot already you won’t be sorry! Suggestions to the developer: -have an option to adjust ball color to range from 1-7 or 8 colors. I can see it being a lot of fun with one color making gameplay much faster and super challenging with 7 or 8 colors. -I keep knocking myself out. In a rush I go to store a ball and either miss the holster or there is already a ball in the holster. An easy fix would be to make a ball inactive once caught. I feel like 2 of 3 games I end up tagging myself out accidentally. -Keep up the great work I can’t wait for more updates and to see what else you release!,"I really enjoyed this workout of a game and look forward to unlocking the items, especially the bow. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZHFsJOSLPQ","I got the game and contacted the devs shortly after, response was pretty quick and they were super nice! Gameplay is just as good!","Updated: after more play, it just keeps getting better and better. The bow and arrow is so cathartic! Original: I have played this game quite a bit and it is really fun trying to top previous scores. I like the basic level best - weirdly relaxing, yet cathartic as you throw balls around the play space and pop balls. But the gravity wrist bands and light swords create a fun take on the game too - a completely different speed than many other sword based games. My favorite thing about the game is the speed - slow and steady. I look forward to other settings in the future."
