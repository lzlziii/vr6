Then I see an Instagram ad for it the other day and it looks leaps and bounds ahead of where it was when I got it the first time and I decided to reinvest. This time I was not disappointed. It has come a long way and the developers seem to have a real passion for adding more to the game and taking suggestions from the fan base. Really love the defense mode, had the game for 2 hours and Iâ€™m already #1 defender in the worldðŸ˜Ž. All that being said, it is a lot of fun but it is still an app lab game so expect bugs and incomplete or clunky features, thatâ€™s just the nature of the dev process. Well done.",Good graphics and all in good stick handling and game modes especially with the fact that vr is only so far they really knocked it out of the park,"I have absolutely no problems, Iâ€™ve had the game for a while and enjoyed every time Iâ€™ve gotten on between my actual practices. Good game overall",Iâ€™ve had fun playing but there are a few problems. 1.overall the game is kinda wonky but still fun. Itâ€™s mainly just face offs and shooting. 2. In the medicine game the ball is to sensitive 3. Height control would greatly help as my player is short Besides that the game is fun and I enjoy playing. Iâ€™m excited for more updates and to play more. I also appreciate the annishnabe version of the game but it feels a bit off with the settings and the spirit creatures. Overall I would recommend the game.,good game
