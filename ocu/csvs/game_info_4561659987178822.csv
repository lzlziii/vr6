WNO | Beethoven in VR,"Beethoven in Virtual Reality, directed by Francesca Zambello. Tamara Wilson and Russell Thomas perform two masterpieces from Beethoven’s only opera, Fidelio—including Leonore’s aria “Komm, Hoffnung” (Come, Hope)—accompanied in 360-degree audio by the Washington National Opera Orchestra, conducted by Principal Conductor Evan Rogister. In a secret underground cell, political prisoner Florestan suffers under tyrant prison governor Don Pizarro. But a light in the darkness is breaking: Leonore, Florestan’s wife, has disguised herself as male guard Fidelio for the ultimate undercover mission. By infiltrating the very system that oppresses her husband, can she be the voice that overthrows it? Beethoven premiered this story of resistance, freedom, and dissent during a time of complete European upheaval. If his “Ode to Joy” declares the universal triumph of peace over war, then his Fidelio is an inspiring ode to love’s transcendent power over tyranny.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", 360 Experience (non-game), Art/Creativity, Movie",English,"5.5

The resolution is excellent with no blurry pixelation or flat-360 video feel. The single stable viewpoint allows the staging to work in 3D - things are the right size and you can watch the performance as if you're there. The actor video integration is seamless, although the scenes selected are quite limited solos, maybe because of technology capacity. Of course the 360 audio has to be perfect here, and it's pretty good given the headset capabilities. The results are much more impressive than the 360 video performance recordings you see e.g. in Horizon worlds, or overly gimmicky tech demos that distract from the work itself. It's interesting where this could go - I'd love to be able to have VR front row seats at a variety of other performances."
