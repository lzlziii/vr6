SETVR [Alpha],"PLEASE NOTE: SETVR is currently in Alpha, this means that we have functionally completed the core features however the application still needs updates for: usability (instructions), repeatability (replayable features), and variability (new content). We hope for SETVR to be fully released in 2022! Thank you, SETVR Team ------------------------- SETVR is a self-defense enhancement training virtual reality platform that allows self-defense practitioners the ability to enhance their muscle memory and reaction time for hand to hand combat situations through virtual assault scenarios. Martial arts and self defense practitioners aren't always able to practice their skills whether it's due to not having a sparring partner, not having a suitable space, or not being able to find the time to train. With SETVR you can practice martial arts and self defense skills at any location, any time, without anyone.",16+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Fighting",English,1.90,DVNC Tech LLC,SETVR,https://setvr.app/,"Apr 6, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3215500731885150/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3215500731885150&r=1, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QRI1luS_TrFJzexJtanXJ0QlQfoufel0/view",932.3 MB,"I examined the meditation portion of the SETVR application. The male and female voices were both pleasant and soothing. Using the sound of lapping water along with the graphic, and the music, was effective and calming for the background scene. The periodic flashes of white light, though, were distracting. In my opinion, the segment could be lengthened for better effectiveness. A good start! New User","I was hyped downloading SETVR! The premise is an ""All-in-1"" fitness and mindfulness application. In the app SETVR combines warmups (punching, jumping side to side, stretching), practice/fights, and cooldowns (yoga/meditation). Currently it has A LOT of features for an App Lab app however these features are still early in development (guess that's where the Alpha title comes from) and are rough around the edges. The main reason I give the app 3 stars is because the devs have implemented features I haven't seen in other VR apps like the practice mode. If it keeps getting updated this app could come close to but be different from bigger VR fighting games. If you get SETVR right now, know that you're getting an in-development VR fitness/fighting experience which depending on how you play games you may like or not. I plan to use it whenever I feel like I've been sitting too long or need to get up and moving quickly (for like 5-10 minutes). TLDR: App is early in development and rough around edges but has potential with interesting fitness and mindfulness features","Save your money. Scaling on combatants is weird, they're about 7 feet tall in-game. Collision detection is weird, it's hard to tell when you've actually made contact with a combatant to either grab or punch, and combatants tend to glitch through you making effective combat impossible. Game has no right advertising yoga as it's nothing more than a single, scripted routine as part of cooldown. This would have been a bad experience for free, for $10 it's an absolute debacle."
