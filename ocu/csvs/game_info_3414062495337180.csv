The jungle looked amazing and immersive. The character modes of the Gorillas and animals you fight look good. Giving you that comic book world feel. Some of the humans though, just didn't feel like the same art style and out of place. SOUND - The sounds effects and music I would say was average. The character lines / voices were good. One thing I enjoyed was the random background lines from Tarzan. It was like someone was reading the comic book thought bubbles to me. Helped with the comic book world feel. CONTROL - Moving Tarzan around felt smooth and great. Climbing trees, jumping and basic movement are spot on. Combat was great. Weapons and punches feel like they are connecting, and you can tell when you laid a punch or not. Swinging from vines feels good, but can still use some work. There are a few times it was hard to get the next vine. Interacting with the world is coming along nice. It has a gravity grab system, so you don't need to bend to pick anything up. The aiming of it was easy. There are a few items I had a hard time picking up. Its like they were stuck in the map. FUN FACTOR - As someone who grew up playing Tarzan and reading the books, this was a really fun VR adventure. I really enjoyed being Tarzan, and being in his world. All you 40+ gamers who grew up with Tarzan will want this one. IMMERSION - From the opening scene to the VR world. You feel like you are in a comic book. The graphics, voices, and world all set you up for the comic book dive. I specially loved the feeling of running and jumping of a ledge into the water below.",I wanted to get multiplayer what feels like 69 years￼,"I did not play the game before the update, but now the graphics level is acceptable if we do not take into account certain failures in the union of the polygons of the environment and the excesive fog, although it is far from the psvr version (I can't understand). The fun for money is good. Question for the developers: Why doesn't it include spanish language and the pc version does? When they include it I will give my 5 stars. Thanks for your work.",Edit 2- Everything I had a problem with has been fixed. It took some time but it's now a great game. I think just a little more communication about updates would have helped. But I strongly recommend the game now. If you refunded it then buy it again. Great game. EDIT 1- No update and not one response from a developer. Just thrown on the store and left. We as the VR community expect better. Minus 1 more star. This game is amazing on PC. I don't expect the Quest version to equal the PC. So far the only downside is no menu to change settings. I do not like snap turn but I assume it will be added later. I will support this game because I know it's potential. Will update when smooth turning is added. But I'm sure updates will come after feedback from players.,I've enjoyed playing it.
