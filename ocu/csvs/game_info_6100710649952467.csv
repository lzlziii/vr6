The puzzles are fun, the design of the character is cute. The puzzles make sense: I can look it over, and usually I can figure it out. The problem comes in with the shadow controls. I'll be frank: Obviously this is a gimmick game. Use hand controls, solve puzzles. Cute. I like it. I frankly wanted more hand-control games for my Oculus, which is why I bought this one. Playing this game has single-handedly (pun intended) explained why there are so few hand-control games on the Oculus right now. When my hand isn't phasing through itself, it's freezing up for no reason. My hands can be in the same place, moving slowly so the character won't phase through my hand, and suddenly the game will not only assume I'm not moving, not ONLY assume that I've apparently turned into a statue, but will ALSO randomly assume that I'm no longer wanting to do the silhouette puzzle as it's MILES away from where I was just trying to solve it. The worst part is easily that the character will die if you squish it with your hand, meaning every time my hand phases out of reality by no fault of my own: Bam. Squished. Reset. Again. I was literally doing one puzzle on the most color-contrasting area of my normally-fine border, and it would. Not. Read. I started getting VCR lines across my left hand randomly. I'd like to sandwich with a reminder that this is NOT a bad game. The hand controls are it's biggest detriment, which is also the reason I bought it to begin with. Maybe when the Quest 3 comes out the hand-controls will be able to support a precision-puzzle such as this, but as of writing this, it might be better to save your money and play other puzzle-based games, or just sitting until there's a console that can actually work with it.",It‚Äôs the kind of game you‚Äôd play once a month but enjoy playing every time! The puzzles are great and the gun is fixed. I haven‚Äôt finished the whole game yet but I‚Äôm having fun :) Just a tiny note: ( sometimes the hands lag and doesn‚Äôt do the things you want but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the game or the headset itself but it).,Hand tracking shadow puzzles in a colorful world to stimulate the mind and exercise your hand movements. It also has a calming zen effect. I strongly recommend. If developers can continue to support future updates of Meta hand tracking modules that would be awesome.,"I love this little game but can‚Äôt get the pistol function to work so I can‚Äôt get past the fourth puzzle. Light level, hand position, nothing seems to help. All the other controls work easily. Thanks so much for your answer! I can get the pistol but still can‚Äôt make it shoot. It looks as if I must use my thumb, but I can‚Äôt see to get it to work. I‚Äôve tried changing my location and orientation, time of day, etc. will try playing facing a blank wall next. Update: drop your thumb below the horizontal and it works!","All that I got from the experience was an extremely glitchy mess where the characters fell through my hand and the gun function rarely read my hands which might just be my oculus so keep it in mind, but I have other games that I love playing with hand tracking so it might just be the game. On top of that there is no hight adjuster so if you are short like me have a stool prepared to finish some of the puzzles. Besides that I liked the world design and music, these could make a good meditation app if the puzzles didn't make me so mad. If you think getting angry over puzzles that are impossible to do with the hand tracking is worth just the look of a game this game may be for you."
