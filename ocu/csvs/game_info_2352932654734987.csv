On a surface level this is true. But there are many guilds that still play and run content. But we do not hang around highsteppe anymore for long. The best way to get into the game is hit max level (it doesn’t take long like 15 hours maybe) and join a guild like saturn,or order of the pheonix. They both are capable of competing most content in game. The game is mainly ran all inside of discord.","I loved this game. The classes were all fun in their own way, the dungeons were great, and the city was always booming with activity. Now? Only small groups for dungeons, can barely find anyone in the capital city besides npc’s, and the beginner area once crowded with new players now empty. I miss this game.","I remember when I first played, I was so lost but help came to me so easily. There was always someone everywhere which was what made it so nice. The fact that there was excitement and activity everywhere. But now I struggle to find even 1 or more players in the capital which used to be filled with energy and players. This is an amazing game when others are playing with you. So sad this game isn’t the same anymore.","2021- Filled with obonxious kids and some few adults. Couldnt enjoy dungeon cause kids being bratty, in addition if you dont have a mic you get treated badly. 2023- Now its just a Ghost Town","So, I'm completely changing my review. So since I couldn't get a refund I finally tried the game again. When I tried, a high level came by and walked me through the initial steps of the game. Since then and learning how to play effectively, wasn't a bad game. However since zenith came out the game feels empty as few people are on."
