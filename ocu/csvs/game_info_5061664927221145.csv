The Great Ocean,"Update: New improved UI, all levels improved with new quests, now over 100 species in the lab to discover, new POI like the coral towers and a new ship wreck, and in the huge level Arctic check out the infamous sunken Russian nuclear submarine Kursk. Also more story included. In the game you explore in a high-tech ROV submarine the earth‚Äôs oceans from the best diving spots in the Galapagos or in Cozumel in Mexico to the icebergs in the Arctic and the Deep Sea and many other fascinating places around our planet's huge underwater world. In each of the levels you solve quests with your ROV's upgradeable tools. The missions are based around real sunken submarines, WW2 battleship wrecks, Deep Sea creatures or Caribbean coral reefs. You will also encounter all of the giants and living wonders of the oceans from sharks, to dolphins, sea turtles and of course the blue whale and discover more about this unique, beautiful and threatened world. With your mission success you take action and contribute to protect and save the oceans. Challenging gameplay engages you on the exploration of the oceans and allow you to go where no one has gone before to reveal the last mysteries of the oceans. There are 3 levels: Galapagos (Gordon Rocks), Cozumel (Deep Coral Reef) and The Arctic (Barents Sea). We continue to add new levels and features over time.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Education","English, German",0.7.4.3,Actrio_Studio,Actrio Studio UG,https://www.actrio-studio.com/,"Sep 16, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5061664927221145/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5061664927221145&r=1, https://actrio-studio.de/privacy-policy/",1.03 GB,"The game has a lot of potential. I love exploring the ocean. I understand it's a very early version, But why isn't the progress saved? Every time I have to start the game from the beginning. Please don't abandon the development!",I mean come on a dollar or two for this . ... a joke right lol no it most definitely is and the graphics are freaking next level. If your into what's lurking in our oceans THIS IS üëê DOWN FOR YOU. NUFF SAID LOL,"I really like the calm diving around and exploring the different levels from shallow Cozumel, to the deeper Galapagos to the real deep Artic - each looks cool. The missions are nice, easy to solve once you know your way and which tools you need to use. The new character voices help you and tell interesting stuff along the way. Its a real historic moment to check out the Kursk.",It's nice to take a break from the intense shooting/action games out there with a gem like The Great Ocean. Great casual exploration game with an education element sprinkled in. I've included it on my video list of top 10 App Lab games: https://youtu.be/Peq49fV911Y
