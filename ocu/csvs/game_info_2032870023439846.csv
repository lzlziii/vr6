To be clear so you know what to expect: itâ€™s not 1:1 physics based combat like DrunkBarFight, itâ€™s animation based but still extremely fun. Freedom of movement, lots of different weapons and intractable objects and set pieces (throw enemies into ceiling fans or ovens etc) with bosses you need to master the pattern of A sequel with either full body tracking, 1:1 physics, or a level editor would be my #1 most wanted ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜",I don't get motion sickness with other games but I do for this one. I feel like with some tweaks this game could have been better and more accommodating for those that want to brawl and not run around with joystick swerve camera around. Should make a mode where I have a 3m by 3m radius or smaller and I stand my ground and beat up goons before moving to next area.,The first time I played this was on my dad's VR and I absolutely loved it but couldn't get past the 3rd boss he was hard but then I played it on mine and crushed it first try all five bosses without dying great graphics good job,Fun fighting game! 25ðŸ’°off /Gergo19851114/2032870023439846/? Just add beginning part (vvvpontoculuspontcomperappreferals),"This game is awesome. Anyone who gave this game 3 stars or lower for any reason other than technical issues is just lame and no fun. It's essentially a retro themed fighting game like your old 90s side-scrollers like 'Final Fight' and 'Streets of Rage', but instead of being a 3rd person side-scroller, it puts you in the first person perspective, within the 3rd Dimension. With the ability to punch, kick, grab your opponent, throw your opponent, and pick up and use many objects around you as weapons: you'll find yourself having a blast as you interact with the different ways to kick butt and defend the city from these thugs and variety of gangs. It's definitely worth 20 bucks, and I think the length of gameplay is perfect. It lasted me days of fun, and I personally think it's replayable for sure. (P.S., I've owned this game from launch, and it's never given me technical problems.)"
