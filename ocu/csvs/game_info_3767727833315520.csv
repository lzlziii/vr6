There is no challenge because you can respawn instantly in the same place when you die. Shooting with pistols is good but if you hold a shotgun or a rifle with 2 hands the second hand is always moving on the gun(fix it devs). That hand bug is a NO GO in a shooter . Could be a great game without this bug.","I beat Doom 1,2, 3, RTCW, Half-Life w/ expansions, and I'm definitely going to play this until the end. Release part 1, I'll buy it.",This game gives me everything I wish for in vr true involvement and loving graphics and to me truly involving freaking fabulous x,"Geezuz devs, I dont understand even slightly how or why Quest isnt pushing this title and instead leaving it Hidden away on App Lab as an obscure treasure to be found. Perhaps it needs to remain on App lab so the few lucky ones who stumble onto this absolute gem and buy it can feel like they hit the app lab lotto!! Seriously to whoever is reading this. This game is like doom 3 on a space ship w heavy RPG elements, mixed with dead space and with a competent narrative story and a lengthy full single player campaign. I'm pretty critical of games especially VR titles, it's a medium I love, it's my passion, I even have a dedicated PSVR YouTube Chan (PSVR Asylum) and I'm pretty critical when it comes to Reviews. I absolutely love this game..why 4 stars? It's really just appearance, I'm not totally loving your character models, they look a bit janky, but perhaps that's part of its charm in the likeness of Vox Machinae style somewhat. I'm trying to find some negatives so it doesnt appear in shilling for this title but the truth is this game is HEAVILY underappreciated and just not given it's due credit. If you like RPGs - BUY IT. If you like space / scifi story single player games - BUY IT. If you like Doom 3 type of creepy shooters - BUY IT. If you appreciate a comprehensive total package that basically nails what they are going for on all fronts with no part of its elements feeling short changed - BUY IT If rough earlier days of VR NPC character design is a turn off - Still BUY IT but expect some slightly goofy disproportional characters. Devs, your game is truly impressive, what you've managed to do as a whole many AAA studios struggle with excelling as a total offering in VR gaming. You'll see 1 or 2 elements done exceptionally while the rest of the game falls short or feels flat. Not here tho, seriously a graphics overhaul w more realistic character designs is the only thing I can think of that holds this title back from becoming one of the greatest VR games of all time up there with TWD Saints & Sinners ranks. Good job, you should feel proud I hope to see more updates, additions, new weapons, and a graphics overhaul/ character redesigns but even if you did NOTHING ELSE from where it sits now, I am enjoying it nonetheless"
