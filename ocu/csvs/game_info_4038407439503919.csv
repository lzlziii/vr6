Hope they can make that better because it's pretty cool. Had to knock another point off because the game is still making me sick from the low framerate. Now the game crashes every time I play it. I'm playing passthrough with hand tracking in seated position and the game crashes every time. Can't even make it through one level anymore.,"I just got the game and was really excited with the hand tracking capability. It works but not all the time to the point that I just had to stop the game for my own sanity and as much as I didn‚Äôt want to I decided to play with the controllers, because the hand tracking was extremely frustrating more than anything but seeing how much fun the game can be especially if I‚Äôm not fighting with it half the time just to hold/control the ball. I also just couldn‚Äôt imagine not giving the game another try even if it meant using the controllers and I‚Äôm truly glad I did. It‚Äôs really fun and felt natural and great when the hand tracking works but at the same time extremely frustrating whenever the hands are just completely uncontrollable and doing their own thing when all I really want is to enjoy shooting hoops and score as high as I can which is impossible when half the time I don‚Äôt even know what the heck they‚Äôre even doing. Using the controllers on the other hand is a whole new level and extremely fun to the point that it‚Äôs mind blowing. Thankfully I have hand straps on my controllers so that I just make sure those are tight enough to feel snug so that I can shoot more naturally since you don‚Äôt need to push any buttons to make the shots and that‚Äôs when the real fun began and I totally forgot all about the frustrations I experienced with the hand tracking‚Ä¶ Hand tracking? ü§î What‚Äôs that? üòÇ Now I‚Äôm so glad I purchased this game and can see myself playing this game whenever I can and have others try it because it‚Äôs just that much fun to play with especially with the challenges to keep it all to myself that I can easily imagine getting lost in the game for hours. And if that‚Äôs not enough which I can‚Äôt imagine that it wouldn‚Äôt be I found it insanely amazing and extremely a very welcome surprise that when I looked at my wrist and saw that I was wearing a wrist watch showing me what time it was ü§©‚Ä¶ How insanely awesome is that and I have to personally thank the devs for this bonus feature which is a small add-on which makes a truly huge impact, so that you can let yourself get lost in the games for hours but if you absolutely need to stop at a certain time all you have to do is check the time on your watch so that you can stop anytime you unfortunately need to. üòÜ And I totally agree that the Halloween theme is extremely fun and challenging to play at the same time, although I‚Äôm not a fan or too crazy about the constant yawning/moaning from the ghosts but that really doesn‚Äôt take anything away from the game other than it makes me want to yawn (which we all know is really contagious) or feel tired myself whenever I hear it‚Ä¶ ü•±ü§£ If hand tracking can be perfected then this will be the best game ever and will gladly give it the ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è it truly deserves, because it‚Äôs really an amazing and solid game, but until that‚Äôs perfected or at least improved so that it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt take anything away from truly enjoying the game, I‚Äôll have to stick with the ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è and hope this will continue to encourage the devs that there‚Äôs always room to make their game even greater if they can resolve some of the challenges the players are experiencing while playing their game. Thank you so much devs, this is truly an outstanding game and extremely fun to play. Keep up the amazing work and thank you for bringing so much joy to everybody who‚Äôs lucky enough to play this game you‚Äôve developed. Truly fantastic and can‚Äôt be any grateful for your genius and hard work to make this a reality in the VR world. ü•Ç","It's a pretty cool and realistic game! I've tried the demo and loved it. Bought because the hand track mode, but got happy because of the rest. The expert hand tracking mode is lame. Doesn't work well... But it deserves 5 starts because of the rest. The controllers mode is really realistic, simulating perfectly basketball movements. You feel exactly like playing in arcades machine. The challenge is fair and you really exercise. I love it and worth each penny.","Feels like a real arcade basketball machine, simple.and fun, with alot of variety of levels you can even use mixed reality where it shows the inside of your room , it's not only fun but also a good workout!! I recommend it for anyone.that likes basketball ,or just wants a fun party game , it's better to use the controls than it is to use hand tracking!"
