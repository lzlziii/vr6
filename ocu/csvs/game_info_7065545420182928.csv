I need an easier mode. It's not fun because I can only do back shots due to the position where the ball flies. It needs to be able to move back and forth, left and right. I changed the size of the ball, but it doesn't work very well. I think the hitting position is important. It's a lot of fun to play with the game by positioning yourself where you want it in a large room. How about making it possible to move with the stick of the controller other than the racket?","Being a huge fan of Racket NX I'm always on the look out for a new racket game. This is one of those games where you say to yourself ""just one more go!"" I found it very difficult to aim my shots and a lot of my good shots were down to luck more than anything else. I'd like to switch between hands during the game and not have to keep the racket in one hand. There's a certain way I like to hit the ball, but it's virtually impossible to hit that kind of shot. I found I had to do backhand shots most of the time and there isn't too much variation of that. Not sure if they'll appear later on but I'd like to see power-ups. Sound FX could be meatier and I'd like better vibrating on the controller when I hit the ball. All in all, not bad, especially for the price. I look forward to updates.","This a game where you can drop in and out and have a blast on levels - when you have 5 mins or an hour! There is so much potential where this could go to! Some active leaderboards filling up nicely also. Accessible for all ages, deflecting the balls of different sizes is immense fun and very addictive, trick shots are so rewarding! As is competing just before the clock. Some levels seem impossible but all are do-able if you think through the puzzle!!","Huge racket nx fan but not comparing it to this . On it’s own this seems to be a polished game. It looks good, it has the racquet ball feel, leaderboards, the concept is great but….as other reviewers have said you cannot hit the ball with any accuracy. This the game gets boring real quick. Still In all this one is worth watching. Devs- change how the ball is launched I think that’s making it hard to hit and maybe look at collision with the racket. Seems to be no physics when it hits the racket, this cannot accurately hit the ball. Like what it is so far…."
