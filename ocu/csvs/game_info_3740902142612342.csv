Sometimes I will touch the ball gently with my mallet and it will go flying across the entire map. Physics are kind of realistic, but glitchy at times. Comfort: 4/10 - Movement is too sharp and I eventually got motion sick. Graphics: 2/10 - Everything is kind of plain and boring. Gameplay: 3/10 - Somewhat fun, but many glitches and bugs. Replayability 5/10 - You’ll only play it again unless you love this game or you’re bored. Worth the money? I got this for free because I won a giveaway, but no. I recommend getting a different game if you want to play croquet.",The length of the mallet is so short it makes players bend too far down when striking the ball. This ruins what otherwise could be an enjoyable game. Hope the developer will enable players to set the length of the mallet themselves.,"Love the physics in this game. This game could easily be 5 stars for me with the addition of 2 things. 1. The environment is too depressing. Give me some blue skies and white fluffy clouds. 2. Add free movement. Forcing teleport-only is a bummer. Bonus: Add multiplayer. When I got this game, it just seemed like something I'd want to share and play with my Dad and brother. Nice slow pace game where we can play and still have a conversation.","First, thank you developers for this challenging game. I enjoyed it. Please continue to improve the game play. The player movement by teleport is not easy or not smooth or too slow or unfriendly, Please fix the teleport function. I do not need to press the thumb stick then press the trigger key to complete the one teleport. I have to press two buttons to do one teleport movement are not good. Please correct me if I am not doing it right .. thank you Latest update of this game is great . Thank you."
