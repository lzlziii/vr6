It would be great if the multiplayer also had voice chat.",Would be so much better if multiplayer actually worked as advertised?,"Please can you make it so that I can adjust my view. For some reason the desk is neck height for me so I canâ€™t play sitting down, or for some reason I spawn behind the chair so I canâ€™t even see the table.. pressing the oculus button puts me in the middle of the table neck high ðŸ˜¬ I love this game though, itâ€™s very addictive, i like how it was easy to learn, with free distractions and I enjoy the visuals. Itâ€™s a shame I canâ€™t play with other online users though as the â€˜join matchâ€™ function doesnâ€™t work. Please fix the height of the table though- itâ€™s such a simple thing, but playing the game depends on it.","Iv tried to find matches several weeks in a row and it seems no developer progress, so im over it unfortunately. Seems abandoned, there's no point in releasing a multiplayer game before multi is enabled, all you do is lose players"
