Hard Line,"Immerse yourself in an exhilarating virtual reality adventure that pays homage to the classic action films of the past. You step into the shoes of a fearless hero facing a harrowing challenge. Terrorists have seized control of a sprawling skyscraper, holding innocent hostages captive within its towering walls. As the lone warrior who can save the day, it is your duty to navigate each treacherous floor, confronting relentless enemies with swift precision and tactical prowess. With every enemy you kill and with every hostage you rescue, you earn XP that can be used to unlock various weapons and upgrades.",18+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Arcade, Shooting",English,0.3.3,Sky Yurt,Visceract,https://visceract.com/vr/hardline,"Jun 26, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6450472471642002/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6450472471642002&r=1, https://visceract.com/vr/hardline/privacy",658.2 MB,"This game has got a lot of potential. First, the graphics are decent even though the floors of the skyscraper look a bit loveless and empty. Enemies look good as does your handgun and your full body avatar. The angle with which you hold your gun feels a bit off and you have to twist your wrist a bit in order to shoot straight - maybe this could be changed a bit. Fighting your way through the skyscraper level by level is quite nice but when you die you have to walk back to the elevator every time. Maybe you could restart directly from the elevator without having to walk back to it or somehow save your progress and not having to start from the beginning when you die. Now comes a part that this game makes way better than most shooters: You can threaten opponents and even knock them down so they become unconscious for some time which is useful when you run out of ammo and need to buy some time for a reload. What a great idea that is! It would be even better if you could grab your opponents weapons and use them against them. Another great idea is that enemies have to reload their weapons as well which gives you time here and there There are some glitches and sometimes you just see a floating gun shooting at you without an enemy. A.I. could be a bit more realistic as opponents are just standing around waiting for you. There is not a lot of cover to use as floors like I said are a bit empty. Overall this game has some great ideas and if they could be imported to games like target react force or tactical assault which have better levels like small houses or more realistic cqc training houses but lack hand to hand options or non lethal options like threatening your enemies or grabbing and punching them, this game would get 5 star ratings easily. In the present state 15€ is too much for what you get. Maybe there is a discord channel to further support the development. Update: The dev really works on the game. Two Updates fixed some issues. Bullets fly a lot faster now and enemies seem to act more intelligently. Actually there is no need to see bullets flying as they are still too slow and this ruins gun handling a bit because you end up looking at the tracers and not your sights. Now you can command your enemies to surrender which is a great idea. Maybe then you could also add some sort of cuffing as non lethal option otherwise ordering them to put their hands up doesn't really make sense. Extra points could be awarded if you clear a whole floor without resorting to deadly violence. Gun handling still feels a bit strange somehow if you want to grab your barrel you often end up ejecting your magazine. Pulling the slide of your Sidearm back is a bit fumbly and aiming still feels a bit off. Enemies sometimes try to shoot you through walls at times and might need some overworking. Again: It's great that the dev works on this game as I think it has got great potential and hopefully it will get further updates!",I like this game for a lot of reasons this reminds me of ready or not I want to say some suggestions 1 this game will be very good with blood splatters and blood pools 2 there should be a screen in the elevator that shows you what pistol you want to start off with 3 coop or ai teammates would be cool 4 also you should also start with a knife to 5 make the player look like swat member 6 more guns 7 breakable item like the windows and other stuff 8 limited amount of ammunition for the mk18 9 when you go behind a enemy and you press a button you can tell the nps to put it’s hands up and gun down those were all my suggestions for this game I hope the developer or developers put hard word in this game
