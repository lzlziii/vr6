Maestro: The Masterclass,"Step on the podium and become a true orchestra conductor in Maestro: The Masterclass. Play hands free or grab a chopstick and master the real hands motions that command the orchestra through an off the rail conducting masterclass that culminates with an epic symphonic concert in a packed opera house. Good luck, Maestro! - Step into a gorgeous opera house packed with a thousand music fans, face a mammoth orchestra of over two hundred virtuosos, and get ready to throw some serious power moves. - Learn to beat tempo, cue musicians or guide crescendos with the power of your hands only - Conduct all music genres from Electro to Jazz, Hip Hop and finish up with an epic Symphonic music concert to become a true Maestro!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Hand Tracking,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Casual, Music & Rhythm","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), Chinese (Taiwan), French (Belgium), French (Canada), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Spanish (Spain)",0.0.205,Double Jack,Double Jack,https://maestro-game.com/,"Aug 18, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4813149252124417/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4813149252124417&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQchKcAJz15RJwRzoOYKTPM2xqzk_3USAS7mSXQVI63k8zBRTkP6BVlRifGdSjSa5ALGtGgQmQYRWck/pub",802.3 MB,It's literally something I've wanted to do since I was a child. I really hope this becomes a game available through Meta and I hope they add more music. This made me feel like I was actually there and everyone was counting on me. I need a full version of this game now please!,"I LOVE this game, I have always wanted to conduct a symphony, and with this, I gained the ability to do so. I really hope that more songs are added or maybe even give people the ability to make their charts for this game. It is an amazing concept, I recommend it to anyone who is slightly interested in music.","As someone who is very into music and looking to major in it, this was an utterly breathtaking experience.","This game is essentially a demo of Maestro VR, available for purchase on Steam. This version only includes one song with a few sound bites for practice during the tutorial. The full version apparently is coming soon to the Quest 2. That being said, none of the songs in my opinion are really packed with a ton of movement or interaction, taking a hit on re-playability. The hand-tracking doesnâ€™t register certain gestures as effectively, such as the crescendo. There is a slight delay on the songâ€™s tempo and the timing of the UI queues when keeping time. However, the fact that itâ€™s a free (albeit short and not super polished) game with hand-tracking alone makes it a worthy addition to your VR library. The hand-tracking isnâ€™t perfect but itâ€™s very solid, and certainly more accurate than the First Hand demo by Meta. This game is especially great for people new to VR and a sneak peak to the full version coming soon. 4/5 stars.",I hope the full version is out soon!ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¼
