Virzoom has really focused all of their attention on developing VZfit and not much has been done for this game. I have a map of the entire Winterstan game memorized. Time just doesnt pass as quickly for me on the VZfit rides as it does riding a Pegasus or blowing up enemy tanks. Virzoom, please, please add to the games. Even new scenery in one of the old games would be amazing.","Yesterday. I hopped on my spin bike ""for 5 minutes"" to test out my recovering hip. I loaded up VZPlay and dove into Thunderbowl, a tank battle game. I played around alone against a bunch of AI tanks for the full 5 minute warm up, only to see another human drop in, riding a giant Star Wars Mech through Thunderbowl. That user blasted me over and over, but I kept coming back, riding harder each time to find a way to blast them first and nail a few AI tanks in the process. 10 minutes and a lot of sweat later, game over. I was schooled!! But the key takeaway is it was crazy fun and motivated a burst of fitness that wasn't supposed to happen. The game made me do it. I fully love and can't get enough of the tank and battle copter games. My kids are into Pegasus riding games such as Gem Hunt and Cowboy (lasso bad guys as you ride) games called Jailbreak. Others just like the animated riding games, which will also get your heart going with challenge segments. When you get tired of Animation, you can flip over to their other app, VZFit, where you can ride any road in the world - though its best to start with the featured rides and popular rides.",love the customer service with this company. I am motivated to exercise.
