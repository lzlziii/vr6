I love the music I love the lyrics I love how I'm making the music also while I change the layout of the piece.. the effects are incredible! I almost bugged out when I unlocked the level that turns the whole tetris board upside down! Or make the pieces super gigantic! Even some boards the tetris pieces are totally different looking and shaped...its soooo much I can hardly describe! I'm in the daily challenges those boards are super cool and incorporate mediation and relaxation. I almost cried it's super wonderful for me! 5 stars all the way! I loved the movie too!

Well, in my opinion, the game is devoid of any real meaningful personality. Best way to describe this game is as filler content, like a b rated movie, something you just do to pass time. I guess it's kinda cool that as you get higher in lines completed the music increases in complexity. But other than that, it's just a basic a$$ Tetris. And functionally and in design, there's no reason for this to be in VR as there's nothing about it that actually takes advantage of the fact. It might as well be a flat screen. Honestly, if you wanted to play this version of Tetris, you might as well play it elsewhere as you wouldn't have to deal with any of the uncomfortableness that comes with VR like the weight on your head and the eye adjustment when you come back to the real world, etc. Speaking of the real world, why is there no option to play Tetris in AR? That would have been an interesting experience for 2 minutes, to play Tetris in the real world. But no. It's Tetris. Nothing good or bad about it. Nothing defining at all. It's just a budget quality Tetris",This is for my mom she said 4 stars i dobt play iy i reccomend bonelab blade and sorcery beat saber and more
