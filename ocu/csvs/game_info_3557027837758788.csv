This incredible technology allows me to immerse myself in my designs and witness them come to life in real-time. I can walk through my creations as they are being built! The ability to see the progress and visualize the end result before it even exists is nothing short of mind-blowing. VR Sketch empowers me to make changes and improvements to my designs on the spot, right in the virtual environment. The level of flexibility and control it offers is simply amazing. What truly excites me is the potential this technology holds for the future. If VR Sketch is already this exceptional, I can only imagine the boundless possibilities that await us in the next two years. This is just the beginning, and I eagerly anticipate the advancements and enhancements that will take place. Kudos to the developers behind VR Sketch for delivering such an outstanding tool. The seamless integration with the Oculus Headset, along with the intuitive controls and graphics, make for an extraordinary user experience.(unreal/enscape plugin üôèüèø) This innovation has truly elevated the field of design, and I couldn't be more thrilled to be a part of it.",Is use it quite often to make some changes or find overlapping surfaces.Its easy to close a hole in a stl with the tools provided.More tools would be nice.It offers a new and exciting way of designing in virtual reality.One of the most notable features of VR Sketch is its intuitive and user-friendly interface.Its basic but its enough to make some nice designs.First time i used it it was something special seeing myself in form of a virtual headset on the screen while in tge screen performing tasks.It was somehow cool.You can also use it with Sketchup Make 2017 which is free.Newer versions of Sketchup are quite expensive.Already use it for 2 years now with the montly subscription of approx 10 Euros but i am happy with the program and i hope this app will get some updates in the near future like beveling and so on..,"It is simply amazing to be able to walk through your designs in VR. It helps me understand my design even better, but also to work together with my customers. I'm also starting to design immediately in VR, it's so intuitive. Recommend for every architect!!",I'll add more I'm trying to set up 3 remote headsets to help with the battle field and Ukraine. With google maps and GIS data.... Then WHAT THREE WORDS...
