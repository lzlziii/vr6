I had great experience n enjoying very much.. graphics are awesome.. keep it up CricVRX.,"Hi, I love playing this game and think it has huge potential. But for the past couple of days, I am running into problems with it. Sometimes when I start the game, the main screen appears but the Start and Settings buttons are non responsive, can't click anything, this behaviour is random. Sometimes it starts, sometimes it just freezes and nothing works. Can you look into it ? please... I really like the game and have been referring to my friends to buy, but with this kind of glitches, I wont be able to do that .... can you please look into it and fix it ?","I like this game very much , feel like a real stadium, such an amazing experience .",I liked this game very much .
