I got no complaints, just suggestions to think about and add. I hope in the future they incorporate the speed bag punch motions, les mills has been the only app to do that so far and knees, and hopefully have it to where you have to turn so it incorporates footwork movemente in place like supernatual does 360. Maybe eventually have a character in the ring putting the gloves up for you to hit or not just ring but differenr backgrounds. Other than that this is a solid app so far, nice and responsive, the punch sounds pretty good to immerse you further into the work out. This one is an absolte keeper for sure",As a boxer this is an amazing way to transfer boxing into VR and actually learn from it. Obviously it doesn’t compare to the real thing but if your looking for a quick sweat I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. If I could add one suggestion can you add a way to customize your own workout. And can you also add a 2x speed or sm,Will the youtube option be back soon? Love to listen to music while working out,"Come break a sweat! Throw some punches, dodge a big red whatever it is, and listen to some great music to keep you moving. It’s freeeeeeeee! All it cost is time! I’m not sure how the points are tallied but I know I’m winning because I’m landing all of my hits. I’m enjoying this game as I’d but I do look forward to other ideas that have in the next update!","This is a very good workout and game. Can't believe it's free, would definitely pay for this. Would of course prefer if it was leaderboards and online play, but it's great anyway."
