End of Night,"End of Night is a CINEMATIC VR experience about the tormenting memories of one man's escape from Denmark to Sweden during WWII. It is an artistic mix of advanced technologies such as photogrammetry and volumetric video, blended together into a collage-like 3D universe. Although realistic in its depiction of war-torn Copenhagen, and based on real accounts, the fictional experience unfolds like dimly recalled fragments of a painful memory. The audience is placed in the passenger seat of a rowboat with a full freedom inside this 360 VR video, sitting face to face with Josef. Through the physical proximity to him and his vivid stories of both heroic and immoral acts, the audience become intimate observers of the trauma experienced by a young man forced to flee his own country. The experience reflects on the theme of survivor's guilt and the impossible choices that people on the run have to make in order to save their own lives.",12+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Entertainment,"Drama, History",English,0.1.3,Makropol,Astrea,https://astreaimmersive.io/,"May 7, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6578787818815815/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6578787818815815&r=1, https://astreaimmersive.io/privacy-policy/",2.69 GB,It’s very well made! I see why it won awards! The download process is annoying. I just watched the directors cut in app while it went. I still had 20% left after but I just moved my oculus up slightly and played on my phone. It’s worth the hassle.,"This is a very unique Story that was put together in a wonderful way. There is a second download you need to get after you install it, but it is worth it. I really enjoy how this was put together to tell this story. Thank you","Update: The developers quickly addressed the technical issues and I’ve repurchased the game. It installs easily now and runs well. Unfortunately the movie is not in stereoscopic 3D, it’s a flat, 360 degree video. Non-stereoscopic content in VR is one of the few things that still make me queasy despite years of near daily VR use. I’m fine with smooth locomotion, air combat, racing, etc. The only thing besides non-stereoscopic environments that can made me sick are frequent frame rate lags in certain game genres like racing. The video seems very compelling so far. The artistic presentation is interesting. Unfortunately it’s very difficult to watch for more than a couple of minutes without feeling ill. But I’m going to keep it and use it to see if I can build up a tolerance for non-stereoscopic videos by watching it for a few minutes a day. If you don’t have a problem with flat 360 degree videos and the subject matter interests you, this is definitely worth a purchase. Five stars if you’re fine with flat 360 videos. Original Review: This is one of those experiences that install in two parts. After you install the player and load that up it takes you to a waiting area where you have to download the rest. If you take the headset off it breaks the download and you have to start all over again. It’s a very large download and hanging out in the menu gets pretty dull fast. Since the secondary download is mandatory they should have the entire thing download at once. I may just set the Quest on a table and put something in front of the proximity sensor and hope that the brief interruption doesn’t break the download, but I’m leaning towards getting a refund because such a sloppy technical design right from the start doesn’t bode well for the actual experience. Update: Since there has been no response from the developers I’ll be requesting a refund.","I had put a piece of tape over the Quest sensor to not interrupt the download, because it was taking awhile. I got 1% in 15 minutes. I wanna love this, come on!","The content which is the actual movie should be download with in the app. It's try to download it for 1.5 hours (covering the proximity sensor and keep moving the headset. I'm very sorry that still didn't help. The movie didn't pass 28% before it failed. I would love the developer contact me so we cloud fix this. Update suggestion : For now, can you give me a link to download the content directly and I'll put it manually inside the relevant folder in the quest?"
