MarsQuest,"Welcome to Mars! As premiered at World Expo 2020 (October 2021) in Dubai you and your friends now have the possibility to take your first steps on the surface of planet Mars! Mars Quest is a ""Party Challenge"" app, a short experience, recommended for groups between 3 to 15 people. Now tested and ""approved"" by no less than four astronauts: Marcos Pontes, Raja ""Grinder"" Chari, Nora Al Matrooshi and Christer Fuglesang. You, as an Event Master, need to set up the environment so it becomes fun and safe for your group. Observe that Mars Quest is a Room Scale experience which uses Hand Tracking and needs 10ft, or 3m, in one direction. We also recommend lowering the Guardian to a minimum (no quick moves). Comments after the experience: ""Best experience I have had!"" ""11 out of 10!"" ""I have had many VR-experiences, but this is the best one so far...""

It's designed to set a person up, then let them go through the experience in 3 to 5 minutes. After which they hand it off to the next person with no additional setup or explanation. No one has to know anything about operating VR to be blown away by this quick and impactful example of what VR can achieve. This was worth the cup of coffee it cost me just for my own amazement. And any person who wants to make a quick point to people that have no interest in learning about VR should have this app. It's perfect for when you take your headset to a family event and everyone wants to try it. And because it's so short and specific, it quickly encourages sharing and turn taking. Unlike a game that someone may choose to keep playing while others are patiently waiting. I hope this team makes more of these. Maybe something for people who can only sit?","I opened the game, followed the little instructions it had, and got down to the surface of the planet to restart the Rover, then it had me go back up in the craft and that was the end. It started all over again. Where and how do we set up this adventure for our friends? It looks cool, works well but... what's next?","The experience is unreal, I felt like I was on another world because of all the sounds and effects. I never knew walking in a VR game could be so epic. I have never seen anything else like it in VR. Really cool experience!"
