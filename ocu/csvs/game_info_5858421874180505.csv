Decoy Drop,"Alright soldier, what we’ve got here is a neural-linked assault mech. We’re going to put this thing down there under your control. Now, this is a decoy mission. You’re going to be a sitting duck out there. We’re hoping that you can draw enough eyes for five minutes to allow us to get into position to destroy our high value target. Decoy Drop is a re-imagining of the classic sci-fi arcade shooter. Easy to pick up and play with 5-minute rounds, this experience is great for those new to VR. The game is built to be played sitting or standing from a stationary position. Practice in 'free play' mode to try and best your own top scores.
