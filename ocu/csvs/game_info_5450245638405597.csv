Boxtrix,"Are you lonely? Bored? Do you want something cutting edge, but also just chill and sit down in your living room? We got the solution! Boxtrix is a competitive puzzle game in your own living room! Sit down and challenge your wits! Get your name on the leaderboard and show everyone that you are much smarter then them. Or just chill and play casually. Time to enjoy some cool cubes! Boxtrix has three modes, Timed, Time Limit and Creative. In Timed mode, each turn has a ticking timer, so you better place your next cube before it runs out! In Time Limit, each game has a fixed length, so you can take however long you want before placing each block. This mode is all about planning your build, and figuring out a way to get those really high scores by scoring combos! And finally Creative mode - no time limits here! Just you, and your cubes. Hope you have a good time together! ;) The base game is completely free!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Arcade, Art/Creativity, Puzzle",English,1.0,KAMPAI,KampaiRaptor,https://kampairaptor.com/,"Nov 28, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5450245638405597/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5450245638405597&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ln5VJfm5PCd2tC3hGoZvvDratRWwUN1-9SMwSQjU3qA/edit#heading=h.goeft78yfb5g",257.5 MB,"I REALLY dug the green pass-through effect, digitizing my room. All of the sounds and music were appropriate, and the time-attack system was fair. With that said, figuring out block placement was annoying because blocks that you hold are transparent, while the blocks that are set in the playing field are opaque. It should be the other way around, because otherwise you can't see the holes that are formed in the middle of the playing grid. It was also a (literal) pain to have to get down on my knees and crawl around; there should be a way to elevate the grid onto a virtual table so you can just walk around it instead. There was also no grid to indicate the ceiling of the playing field, until I realized it goes up to a certain tile count and just won't take anything higher, despite having no indicator. Boxtrix sort of makes me think of the mobile game Doptrix. Overall it's a great idea but the biggest issue is the lack of a wireframe for set blocks.","Thank you for trying out Boxtrix! We wanted to create a puzzle game utilizing the Passthrough mode, and thus Boxtrix was born! If you have feedback or want to chat with us devs, feel free to join our discord: https://discord.gg/BTvQfSgzxF Thanks again, and hope you join the cube!"
