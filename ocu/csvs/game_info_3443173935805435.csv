Puzzle pieces can be a little tricky at times and if you're doing a big puzzle the music could do with shuffling between multiple tracks or just some ambiant sounds as you start to notice the loops a bit. If you want a puzzle game I would find it hard to talk you out of this one","Puzzling places is better as no music just really good sound effects... Please add an option to turn off the rubbish music, i have to turn down the volume otherwise n it spoils it (its the same fckin song on every level!!!!!!!, who wants to play a game with no sound??? I paid for this game n have played it once n music put me off ad rather pay more for puzzling places... (have a go at that game n take notes please developers of this game, there is a demo on app lab db)","That's the summary for now, I can't give more than 2 stars to the game right now, and it has some issues. It feels very in progress. For the devs: First,the scale of things is too big for a jigsaw puzzle. It gets unwieldy, the pieces are cumbersome to rotate around, they obstruct your view around, it makes the player need more space to play, etc. Reduce the general scale a 30% at least. Bonus points if you get to be player customizable (it would be cool if you could zoom in/out). Second, there is no reference picture/model in your 3d jigsaw puzzle game. That's... Puzzling, no pun intended. Third, you have put annoying music in the game and no options menu to turn it off. Fourth, there are no cursor or force-grab action to pick far away pieces.",Solid game. Relaxing and the puzzles are well done!,"This has a lot of potential, but right now it's pretty rough. Love the art style and the quirky models, but the UI is really plain with no feedback or celebration of any sort for finishing a puzzle. Most importantly, it's hard for us to reach half the pieces with how high and low some of them are, and even then it can sometimes get REALLY crowded and confusing fast when you're stuck in one place. Please give us some way to ""pull"" items to us, or at least some sort of artificial movement to mitigate this."
