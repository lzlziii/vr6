For starters, the graphics are unrivaled. The feedback the app offers after a speech is invaluable if you're trying to improve your public speaking. The customization is great, from handhelds to various venues to audience size. I've also used this app as preparation for Toastmasters speeches and the crowd could not believe my progress. My secret, Ovation. The secret is out....","As an educator, it is difficult to find quality VR apps. OvationVR fills that void. The product can be used for a single or for a group (education or corporate) and now has multiplayer mode with various roles built in. This app has been well thought out and is easy for anyone to use! Highly endorsed. Support is A+.","So excited to introduce students to the future of public speaking practice! It's one thing to tell students they need to practice their speeches, it's another to put them in an immersive world where they get real time feedback on pitch, rate, eye contact, and gestures AND their slides and notes are there, too. As a forensics competition coach, I can coach my students wherever we are using the multiplayer option or debaters can spar, duo partners can practice, and team members can peer coach. The future deserves an Ovation üëè","Looking for a way to improve presentation skills without tying up staff capacity, I came across OvationVR. The application is very user-friendly, easy to use and gives constructive feedback on his presentation skills in terms of gestures, facial expressions and speech. It's super realistically designed, customisable and you can upload your own files. I highly recommend the app to strengthen one's public speaking skills.",This app is designed super well... and I have been testing VR applications for productivity purposes for a long time. I am also a Toastmaster and can see how this is going to work wonders for speakers to gain meaningful practice with their presentations and speeches! So happy I found this as it is even better than what I could have imagined!
