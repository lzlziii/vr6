Splash N Dash,"Do you just love the idea of creating something beautiful with paint but don't think you have the skills? Well now, just like in the real world, you can paint by number. This time though, in virtual reality, there is no need to worry about the paint stains and spills, the brushes or even the canvas. 'splashNdash' is the brand new Virtual Reality paint by number application based on the amazing 'Tilt Brush platform. The app is still under development but we hope to add some great and exciting features very soon. The app is free to use for non commercial purposes which is great for you. Kick back, sit back (or stand) and experience one of the most relaxing and stress reducing ways of creating art. We look forward to your feedback and requests for future updates. Happy painting.

I have essentially got Tilt Brush for free. Took a while to locate the painting by number files - I got the information from their Facebook page. It's was literally right in front of me on the non painting controller under local media library (to the left of the footprints). Looks like they will convert an image for you too - I'll put that to the test asap.,there are no paint by number template pictures to be found yet.,Would be Great if it worked
