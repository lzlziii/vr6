HitMotion:Reloaded Demo,"HitMotion: Reloaded is a new way of doing fitness in VR. Step inside virtual reality, and stay fit while having fun! HitMotion is about moving inside a virtual ring, punching targets fast and dodging the attacks of bars coming towards you. There is no front rail like in many other similar games, but a ring where you fight the enemies appearing all around you. The training is pretty intense, and in a few minutes, you are going to punch many targets and sweat a lot. And if a level is too easy for you, don't worry: you can customize the force required to hit the targets and also the duration of the level to best suit your training needs. The game is currently in alpha, and in this free demo, you can play 2 training levels + 8 static workout levels. You can play in AR or VR and even customize your music. We plan to introduce leaderboards, daily challenges, dynamic levels, and much more in a future full release of HitMotion if we get enough funding. Are you ready for the fitness battle?",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Fighting, Sports",English,0.3.2,New Technology Walkers,New Technology Walkers,https://ntwalkers.it/,"Jul 29, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4461611240539140/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4461611240539140&r=1, https://hitmotion.games/privacy-policy-2/",474.9 MB,But this game is also great.,"What I like: 1) Haptics feel great 2) Sound effects are not bad 3) Penalizes you for bad form 4) Fairly good workout 5) Custom songs (was thinking the music would get annoying, glad I can use my own music) 6) I like the gamification What I think could be improved 1) I wish I could somehow turn up the pace, a little too limited for me. Maybe sometimes make double or triple hits before the orbs disappear, for example? 2) The beams could come a little faster as well, make the combos and ducking feel a little more life-like.",Very good and motivating fitness game,"Decently nice workout for teenagers that are locked to the home not the gym, Simple concept, Got boring after a bit but I'll still play it just for the exercise","Working out in VR is my primary experience I run towards! Not one for rhythm games, this game keeps it simple with tunes to keep you hyped! Part of my routine now, works well to not over extend you're posture or form to hurt yourself! Highly recommend if you like working up a sweat with boxing style experiences! Good on you devs!"
