Lost in Place,"Dear Volunteer, Thanks for accepting our invitation to run through these challenging trials. We'll be testing your cognitive and motor functions as you pilot a little ship around a variety of environments. The ship is very touchy, quite expensive, and it will break on just about everything. Don't worry though, you'll only be graded on your performance! We've established strict metrics to stimulate your competitive spirit and get your blood pumping. You can even compare yourself to other volunteers to see how well you are doing. Just a little friendly competition, nothing nefarious on our end. On that note, please do your very best and try to have fun.

This is so much fun i love the flight mechanics there was a free side quest game called lunar lander and this is the first thing that's come close to that feeling. I've only played thru the tutorial and a little way through the first room but it's a blast. I'm wondering if at some point I'll get fuel restricted or if we just get infinite fuel could be a fun challenge mode..... seriously I need this as a mod for ksp I can't help but think docking would be so much easier in vr with motion controls,"I had to recently do the unthinkable and factory reset my headset (which to be honest isnt that too much of a pain) the day before I did it, I downloaded this game, but didnt play it. The next day the dreaded (not connecting to Wifi -mega problem) lurgy came, so FR it had to be. I installed all the important apps and on some of them, my high scores etc were saved..so win win... I needed to have a bit of a clear out anyways, so I only installed the apps that I really wanted . To be honest This WASN'T high on my list to reinstall(on the games that didnt save, I needed to play on them to get myself back up to speed, so been busy with them) Yesterday, however I did put it back on, and I NOW know that this will be one of the first apps that I will put back on if it ever happens again. It's just amazing...the other reviews on here speak as I would. Very entertaining, frustrating ( but you will complete, just to shake a fist at that frustration) funny and exciting. A game for all ages. Would love to see some of my mates on it, so I could compete against them. This will get you hooked into Radio Control, when you think you couldn't afford it. Very much looking forward to updates and if possible some AR. Would love to see the spaceship fly around my house Very very well done Dev's a really superb title.","This game surprise me, i 've seen a review on YouTube and decided to try it. Wow what a great surprise, this game is just amazing it is simple but pretty well made. Control are great, it's as you control a tiny RC drone in your house but it is so natural. It is really immersive and addictive, a real challenging game, do the best to have the best time. Currently, i think there is 50 level but other coming soon. Believe me i've got so many game on my Quest2 but treasure like that is really enjoy me, i hope it will come on the official store it deserve it. Devs please a multiplayer mode could be really fun","Since experiencing the RC blimp in 'First Steps', I figured the Quest experience would be awash in that sort of 'RC feel' experience, but alas, I never quite found it until this game came along. Buzz a little lander-bot around rooms in a house, zipping under tables or around your head, while dodging ceiling fans and unfortunately placed house plants, spinning in place to maintain line of sight to the bot to keep it on its path. You are awarded completion medals similar to what you'd expect in level-based puzzle/time trials, and I think the challenge level is well set. A try or two will see you finishing the levels, but you'll need more practice to 'get gud' and nab all the medals. I've been a Quest 2 User since Xmas, bought and played a lot of fun games, but this is the first I've written a review for to help this game find its audience that I believe is out there. Looking forward to more maps and fun places to buzz!","It is quite often the simple things in life that will give the most unexpected joy. Lost in place is one those joyous moments where you realise you have found a real gem of a game, that will likely and unfortunately be missed by many. The idea is simple, control your drone, a mini lunar lander, take off from one pad and land at another in as quick a time as is possible. The execution becomes progressively more tricky and difficult as you need to collect tokens along the way whilst avoiding household objects, such as chairs, lamps or tables, even flying into the eaves of a roof over and through timber beam framework. Your lander is controles using a single controller, either left or right, the trigger is your thrust and the direction mapped to the controller and therefore your wrist movements. You are able to teleport yourself around the environment to allow you to gain a better view, I tended to stick in the starting location, physically turning myself to follow the landers path. There are currently 5 household locations that become open to you the more tokens you collect and to win these tokens you need to complete each of the challenges within the times allowed. And here lies the real challenge of the game, I found myself constantly repeating the same errors in my quest to shave those few important seconds of my time. This did lead me to frustration, but at my own lack of coordination rather than the games mechanics, and lead me to try just that once more, knowing that perfect flight could indeed be this next one. I love this game, the commentary from my unseen tutor is hilarious at times, being inspired by the likes of Portal and Esper, the visuals do more than enough to give you the impression that you are in a virtual creation of a home, this is a simulation, that also seems to have been haunted by a poltergeist as the furniture in later levels is strewn around the environment. Trust me, try this, you will love itâ€¦ oh and check out the world leaderboards for each challenge."
