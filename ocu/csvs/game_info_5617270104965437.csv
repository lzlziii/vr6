You are immersed into a beautiful VR country land farm. From the nice graphics to the sounds all around, you will be feeling the country life. You start the game off simple, growing and harvesting a few vegetables and fruit. Which you then sell to the market. With the money you earn, you can buy new seeds to grow, more land to grow on, live stock (lots of animals to pick from), even build a green house. The game has plenty to do and expand. After a longs days work, you can relax with a treat and sit back and enjoy the country side. Pet the barn cat or relax by the pond, its an open world for you to have fun with. The game has three modes of movement. Free locomotion, teleport, and actually walking. If you don't have your VR legs yet, don't worry the game has you covered. I had a blast shooting this video, and had to jump back in to raise money and buy some chickens. Now I have eggs to harvest. Next will be a cow, the game just keeps you coming back to work on your farm. If you like gardening or wonder what the farm life is like, this is a must grab title. See you all, down on the farm. Watch my preview here; https://youtu.be/ywmXtBpDbPs","This game is like a perfect vr gardening/farming game. You can plant like 5/6 types of seeds, buy cows, pigs, chickens, and goats. The only improvements that I would like to see are different music and more seeds.","I loved this game so much! It is so fun,I quite enjoy doing new activities and exploring! I cannot wait for more updates!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
