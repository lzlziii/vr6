And it includes little details like the pine cone that makes a noise. I really hope they add in more content. As of the time of me writing this (April 4, 2021), the game $21, but feels like a polished demo. I could return the game, but I won’t as I really hope they add in more content, since as of today, this game isn’t on the official store yet.","I can appreciate the effort the devs put into this experience, that with all the cast from the anime series, this feels like a canon episode. The graphics were also made to make it close to the anime. There is not a lot you can do in this title, though, mostly just point and click with your line of sight, and the exploration around the lake lacking. A lot of the actions are just black screen with sound effects. If they allow me to pour my own drink or make the dinner step by step, it would be more enjoyable."
