Its enchanting atmosphere, interactive gameplay, and stunning visuals make it a must-play for magic-loving VR enthusiasts.",I am a VR newbie and this has been a joy to putter around with. I feel a bit bad for the magical skull companion as I've given him a couple unintentional whacks trying to figure out how things work. I'll have to work out how to tell the dear old boy I'm sorry for that & shoving everything I can get my hands on in his face so he can tell me about it. I haven't delved much into the greater plot just yet and I rather unlocked the court yard by accident. I'm sure many other curious adventures await and I'm looking forward to my next session already!
