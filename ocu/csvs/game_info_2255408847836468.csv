Racket: Nx,"Racquetball meets Breakout inside a giant pinball machine! Racket: Nx is a new kind of game that challenges the limits of what you can do with a racket and ball in VR. The game features: - 2 single player modes - a campaign and an endless runner. - Competitive multiplayer supporting cross platform. - A sick OST and the option to play your own music in game! - Cross Buy with the Rift. The game is played inside a giant glass dome, the walls of which light up with targets you must destroy with the ball. But this is no ordinary ball. Hit it with force and it will slam into the wall, rolling across it and bulldozing everything in its path. Use your racket's tractor beam to pull it back, or simply to line up your next shot exactly where you want it. Targets appear in Waves, and your goal is to destroy them all before your energy runs out. But targets aren't the only thing in the arena. So be quick, accurate and smart. Plan your shots well.

No crazy rules to remember like tennis. Just get the ball to the targets, and the harder you hit it the longer it sticks to the dome plowing through targets. They have modes where a life bar counts down and you die if you don't hit health targets. But, you can play arcade zen mode, which is infinite life and infinite play. Perfect for a workout where I just want to switch my brain off and zone out. The music is pumping, and the ball is zooming. Initially I was change controller to other hand to even out the work. But, by accident I clicked the trigger on the other controller, and the racket changes hands! Instant game changer, bc you can use both controllers and just switch hands as needed! I don't know why the tutorials didn't mention that. I wfh, and play this for 1/2 hr during lunch for a quick workout, and it's been a great stress reliever.","It would be nice to have more arenas and perhaps less repetitive structure. Apart from it, really good game To get 25 percent üòç off go to lin ktr(dot)ee/megadis count (replace (dot) with . and remove spaces) Subscribe to the deals!","I've had my Oculus Quest 2 for a year now and this was one of the first games I purchased. Since then, I must have purchased 30-40 games, and not one, not a single one, has come close to the fun I have on Racket NX. PROS.... *The most polished, well presented game on the Quest. *Smooth as silk gameplay *Gorgeous graphics *Incredible Sound FX and music (you can easily play your own music too!) *Constantly updated *Very friendly online community *Very approachable and friendly developers via Discord. *The only racket/ball game I have played with convincing physics. *The best VR experience I have had so far on the Quest. CONS.... *Absolutely nothing!! ***UPDATE*** **I can't seem to listen to my own music anymore, the switch to turn my music on doesn't work!!! Please fix!!** **Are there any plans to create modifiers (like with Pistol Whip) where you can create different game modes, which have their own leaderboards? That would be superb,!!**","I love the concept. This game has a futuristic style tron feel about it and it will keep you smashing that ball off walls until your panting for your breathe. The sound effects and graphics are right on the ball too, this is a game i keep coming back to. Great job.","I‚Äôve got so many games, but anyone wanting a co op game, this is it. Hours and hours of laughs and fun. This is the game you need to play!! Here: eeevanC/2255408847836468/?utm_source=2"
