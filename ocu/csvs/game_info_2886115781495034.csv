YUKI,"YUKI is an upbeat mix of the bullet-hell and roguelike game genres in VR, set in an incredible anime universe. Step into the imagination of a child and fly through multidimensional worlds holding her favorite action character, Yuki. Use your hands to fly Yuki and dodge loads of bullets and obstacles that cross your path! Groove to the sound of mesmerizing music as you maneuver through each of the new spellbinding game levels while blasting the evil Yokaliens. Collect cool power-ups to become stronger as you face new levels that surprise you every time. The more you play, the more powerful you become, and better are the chances you'll make it through. After all, a child's imagination can cease evil, and the only way to save the universe is to play like a kid!

Only loses a star because I'm not sure the genre is for me and I usually play other games. Would be cool/better if there was a first person option, though I can understand why there isn't one as that would make the game a different kind of game. Definitely a unique experience and worth getting. Worth full price.

Beautiful, but unplayable due to the arm movement required. Wow that hurt.","I played this for about an hour and was weirdly underwhelmed given the stellar reviews and comparison with other very good games of lower rating. It's cool and well-made, but low on visual and audio effects, and something mades it tedious for me. I think it's the general ""pew-pew"" noise aesthetic. Shooting enemies is not satisfying because they just kinda wiggle like rubber when hit and don't make much (any?) noise or generate lighting effects or anything so it feels empty and flat. Thinking back to Life Force on the NES, this also had the pew-pew, but when you were hitting enemies they popped with a noise and the sweet spot on the boss made very satisfying noises especially when you had lots of upgrades. I somewhat enjoyed the first boss battle but it was easy to figure out and then I felt untouchable. It's kinda fun to fly through stuff, and the patterns of bullets are pretty, but it all felt a little flat and a bit like a vr demo. I don't know I guess I was hoping for a bullet hell game where I upgrade as I go until I am spewing hell while things flash and explode around me. This game felt very quiet and chill, so if that's your jam, go for it! Minor point, after each episode (stage) I didn't see an option to save and quit, and haven't had the bravery to just quit mid run and lose all the progress yet. If you can't put this down and continue later, I can't play it because I only have a few minutes here and there, and a full run takes like an hour as you get upgraded (?)","One of the current VR staples, perfect for first timers as well.","Sometimes you play a game and you know it’s good but for some reason it just ain’t your bag. Well, that’s Yuki in a nutshell for me. It’s clearly a quality game. I just don’t really like these type of games I guess."
