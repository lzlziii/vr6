Ultimate Snowball Fight,"Compete for the Crown by throwing Snowballs and Snowbombs to defeat other real players and bots all while staying out of the storm!

Maintain momentum to cover large areas of ground quickly, search for powerups, and seek out enemies. Physics Based Gameplay! No more pointing a gun and pulling the trigger, now your physical throwing accuracy translates directly to where you hit. Climb Anything, Fly Anywhere! Literally no limits. If you want to fly out of the game world, go for it. Results may vary. Drop in / Drop Out Spectating! Join in mid round or want to take a break for a round?

Combined with some crazy over the top movement it creates a unique gameplay experience for an already widely loved genre. Definitely some more polish to the movement and more players would take this title to the next level.","Wild physics based gameplay. After the newest update definitely give it a try. Super solid workout as well with the sprinting and gliding mechanics, had me sweating buckets. 10/10",More people need to try this title! An absolute blast with some new mechanics that I've yet to see implemented in any other VR titles. Give it a try!
