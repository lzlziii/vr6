I wish there was more! (A DLC wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea) The games story is extremely interesting and had me extremely engaged. The game is the right amount of difficult, and doesn‚Äôt get you stuck for more time than necessary. The scares are extremely creepy and well timed. The music is amazing, the atmosphere fits PERFECTLY. I could go on forever on how much I love this game. The last part in the dark was so creepy, I put down my headset for a week because I really didn‚Äôt want to play it. I felt like every time I turned a corner it was gonna be a game over. If you like horror, this is a MUST BUY.","I've played through and beat this game 2 times and it never got old to me. Heck I even made a third save just to attempt to get all of the dialogue and secrets. It's so fun and there's alot of replayability in the game. I recommend this game to anyone, THATS how good it is. Five stars for sure üëç.","Bought this game a few weeks ago and didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd like it due to reviews at first I‚Äôm a big resident evil fan and played the vr version and was completely impressed and walking dead as well. This game is for sure in that league of horror/survival, I totally recommend this game to your library and to the makers of this game kudos to you",It's an okay game. But the controlls are hard to use when trying to grab things and open doors. I'm stuck in a room because I can't get the grab button to grab the door handle to open the door. My hand just keeps going through the door handle.,"So i bought this game quite a while ago, played it for a bit and then returned it. It had an ominous feel but nothing much was happening and it didn‚Äôt wow me, so I figured it wasn‚Äôt worth my money and would be a lame game. Later on it went on sale and I bought it again, thinking it might be worth the reduced price. I just recently started playing again and I‚Äôm so glad I did. I think it‚Äôs about a third of the way through the game when it picks up and gets scarier, starting with the garden. The tension just increases from there to the point where i may play for a minute and need a break before I could get up the nerve to face what I knew was coming. I think i have a high tolerance for horror, its kinda my thing. Movies don‚Äôt scare me and I don‚Äôt startle but this game made me jump a few times. The atmosphere reminded me of Dreadhalls. This is probably the scariest game on Quest. You don‚Äôt get some of your abilities until the game is half or more over, so at first i was disappointed and thought there was false advertising going on. The game description is accurate, it just takes time."
