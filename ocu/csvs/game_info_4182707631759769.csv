This game swarms you with a **** ton of enemies at once with no time to react. And then when you kill those enemies more just spawn in. One level just felt like a wave shooter, I would kill a bunch of enemies and then more, and more, and more would spawn in. To this day i am still stuck on that one level. Gunplay is decent i guess. I hate how a character gives you a “special gun” and then the gun is the same exact gun you got earlier in the game (except with a silencer, or different skin) you could have at least made that gun do more damage, less damage, or for the ones with the silencers on them you can make attract enemies less. Other than that i think this game is good. The story is fun, i like the low poly look of the game, and it can just be an overall fun game/time killer. I just think the gunplay and enemies can use a little more work.","The game was very cool the aspect of shooting your way through hordes while exploring is very neat though the first of the cactus cowboy games I've played was the ""Plants At War"" (this being my second) after being spoiled with that one for me the story felt kinda bland and there's a lot of parts that play into this: 1.) It's kinda my fault I really love WWll and I'm a history and geography buff so to go from something I'm interested in to something I know nothing about was a big jump(not your fault tho) 2.) Going back to the part about me being a history buff there was an odd connection between times (current vehicles and weapons) but also older things such as Stielhandgranates but I guess I can't be upset it's a fictitious game about cacti fighting alien robots which brings me to my third and final reason. 3.) This is more of a question. Talking Cacti fighting alien robots??? idek where that came and I'm kinda curious to know but that kinda ties into the bland story the ww2 game had more reasoning behind the story and stuff but this felt kinda random. But I just want to add the reason my rating is a 4 and not lower is that from what I've seen this game was made BEFORE ""Cactus Cowboy: Plants At War"" which takes off all my complaints pretty much; and that this was made by one person in a short span of time which adds to the lower quality so I think it deserves a 4 rating. Anything I said in this I hope you didn't take badly just giving feedback keep up the good work devs, and if you're thinking about getting the game go ahead and get it it's still a fun experience.",Bro only cool guys plays this wanna be one? Then play this game,PLAY THIS GAME
