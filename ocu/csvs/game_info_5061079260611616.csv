Pickleball: The Road to 5.0,"Enter the most realistic pickleball training app available! Developed by a group of vision experts to train eye-hand coordination and improve on-court decision making. This is not a pickleball match simulation. It houses strategic drills to ensure your progression in the sport. The app contains 6 keys drills that prove to be powerful for training and engaging. This app has something for all skill levels. We continue to work on this app, so stay in touch!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Simulation, Sports",English,0.1.9,Pickle Docs,CVC Game Dev,http://VRPickle.com/,"Jun 24, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5061079260611616/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5061079260611616&r=1, https://vrpickle.com/privacy-policy",143.1 MB,"I like your app, but when I use defend the slam the ball sometimes just stops when it hits the court and just dies, also please tell how I can more the net because sometimes it’s right in front of me and then to low , it’s never in the same place every time.","I am really rooting for this app to improve. It fills a void and many real-life PBaller's would enjoy a VR app with authentic drills to improve our game. In it's current state, this is not that app. The concept is on-target and it contains the right variety of drills. It's failure is with very poor ball physics. As result, it is terribly frustrating to play and I can't see continuing to invest my time in the game until developer releases an update that improves the game play. There are currently two other PB games in the development lab that are much further along in development and have included drills in addition to the main gameplay. Both developers of those apps are remarkably responsive to user input and releasing updates frequently. Money is better spent supporting those two apps unless we see a big improvement in this game. Would love for the developer to prove me wrong and release a major new update that improves ball physics.",I think this would be an awesome tool for pickleballers but u can’t adjust no instructions angles off,"If you can get the bugs out of this app, it will be awesome. Some observations. I have to hold the hand controller a little off center to be able to connect with the ball. Holding the controller as intended seems to set the paddle to a slight angle. Also, the biggest fix you need to make is to allow the player to move their position using the joystick. You are assuming a larger play area than most people have in their homes.","Thank you for building this -- a work in progress, but this could be great! Here are my notes The paddle seems like it might be a little smaller than a normal paddle? The ball is substantially larger than a standard pickleball. This is most noticeable in Practice Wall, when you can hold the ball on the paddle. Also, it would be nice if the color of the ball were a bit more neon green, since this is the most common color I usually play with. The feel of the ball is strange and not bouncy. In Practice Wall, you can see that the ball does not ""bounce"" on the paddle, but can easily be caught with no recoil. Dropping the ball onto the court also does not bounce quite as high as I'm used to, though maybe this part is imagined or specific to the courts/balls I use. In third shot drop, it feels like I have to put a fair amount of velocity into the swing to get the ball over the net; in reality, much less is needed and it's more of a ""pushing"" than a ""hitting"". Smaller note: the net cord runs parallel to the horizon, but standard pickleball nets have an arc from 36"" at the posts to 34"" in the middle. Defend the smash seems impossible to me. I felt like it was really difficult to figure out where the paddle was meant to be in relation to the ball, and the ball often behaved in unpredictable ways (usually with a lot less momentum than expected) when I did manage to make contact. Overall, I've been waiting for pickleball on Oculus for a long time so I'm stoked that somebody's working on it. I look forward to seeing the updates. I feel like the ball physics are way more important than # of drills or game modes, and once those are figured out, I'm 100% going to figure out how to attach the controller to a real paddle for big fun."
