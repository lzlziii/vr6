And most of the time it is, and sometimes that's all I'm in the mood for at the end of a long day. But also most of the time it is cute and charming, with occasionally a soupcon of challenge. Never any time limits (that I've seen yet), which is good, as I don't do well with those. Some puzzles made me chuckle at how clever the solution was (you often have to think ""outside the box""). This would be good for kids of a younger age or for adults who are still kids at heart. To the reviewer complaining about the flags -- I feel sorry for you that you have so much anger. I guarantee children won't even know what that flag means unless you tell them (hate is learned, not born with). Ironically this seems like just the game to help you relax but you've probably already refunded it. Seek help. (One star deducted because the controls can be a bit wonky (although this might be just because you have bats for hands lol). This might lead to frustration, but the fact that there are no time limits helps.)","Go to bit PERIOD ly / Biastes to find deals on tons of oculus games including this one (remove the spaces and replace the PERIOD with a .) What a fun a silly game. For what it does, it does really well. There is a lot of unique levels and some of them are even a bit challenging, and I think this game is hilarious. I would check it out",My daughter absolutely loves. It is actually educational too as it makes her think in abstract conceptual ways. Lots of fun.,Love the humor and it's fun to play. Gonna try Speedruning,"One of the only titles that I can say is made for VR. Itâ€™s creative and fun, and you never know what you are going to get next. If I could only play one single player title on the Quest, it would be this."
