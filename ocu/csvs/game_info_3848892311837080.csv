Arrows,"Arrows is a tower defense bow and arrow shooter where you have to defend villages, castles and sacred temples from waves of VIKINGS, KNIGHTS and even some sneaky NINJAS. Pay close attention to the GIANT TROLLS and GOLEMS. They are very strong! Teleport around to improve your position and aim for the enemies' heads for better results. Use your powerful CANNON when necessary! Play through three different regions with more than 30 different types of enemies in some beautifully crafted environments. There are also three difficulties - DAWN (easy), DUSK (normal) and NIGHT (expert) that offer you with 27 unique levels to beat! Unlock new levels, difficulties and special powers - FIRE and ICE - that will help you beat your high score. Equip your powers before your session starts and use them WITH NO LIMITS during the game. We really hope you will enjoy your time with Arrows!",12+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure",English,1.2.7,Aura Studios,Aura Studios,https://alexandregordo.com/arrows,"Mar 15, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3848892311837080/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3848892311837080&r=1, https://aurastudios.xyz/",635.9 MB,"Love it! Really fun, simple archery game with clean mechanicsâ€”great for a new VR player",Excellent app - love the concept! Was looking for something like this. Great fun and super gameplay.,"Ffrom the first moment I started playing Arrows I was hooked! The game is just soooo good! Excellent graphics, fun concept, unique and very well executed... with some minor quirks like arrows often going straight through the enemies heads - and sometimes body - without registering a hit, please fix?! Other than that it's an amazing experience, I will be recommending this game to everyone I know :) Thank you so much and can't wait for the next update!","This is a fun arrow game, very similar to LONGBOW from the Steam Lab, but better because you can run it directly on the Quest 2 without the cable or a high-end computer. We are still working our way through the levels and villages, but so far the experience is great. No glitches of consequence, and the game play is varied enough to keep it fun. You can move around across different perches and places, shooting your arrows from more or less convenient spots. And there is a cannon later that helps defeat the giant. Well done. And our family really appreciates the low price point, and don't-need-a-cable features. Much appreciated.","Awesome alternative to ""The Lab"" longbow game! Multiple levels are detailed and cute! Very easy on the stomach, didn't have any motion sickness issues"
