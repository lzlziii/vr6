TOKYO GAME SHOW VR 2022,"This is the official VR application of TOKYO GAME SHOW VR 2022. An evolved Tokyo Game Show's virtual site is returning this fall! You will be an explorer searching “GAME STOPE” - the dungeon spreads in the underground of Makuhari Messe Event Hall. Let’s enjoy visiting booths of various game companies, a special exhibition where you can look back at the history of games, and more! Once you enter the venue, you will be greeted by famous characters and will immediately feel the drastic changes from last year. Adding to existing functions such as Voice Chat, HELLO, and Stamps, there will be new features that make the Game Show more enjoyable and playable. · Avatar Customization: Freely customize your avatar body parts and outfits! · Quest System: Advance the story and earn items by completing quests! Earn Three Sacred Treasures and check out what's at the bottom of the strata with your own eyes!

I somewhat did feel like I was at a games show. There were energy drink ads and scanitily clad anime's, the whole shebang.",This is my first time attending a Tokyo Game Show VR experience and I have to admit they really did an amazing job in my opinion. They gamified it and added multiplayer so I was able to spend a whole two hours with a close friend walking around talking about games and collecting outfits / taking photos. The graphics that they pulled off on Quest 2 standalone are surprisingly good too for all the various game studios' assets that were pulled together in one app! Very cool and I hope many people try this before it ends!,"I really would like to enjoy the TGS within this app like last year. Unfortunately the sound is atrocious as it is heavily overdriven/overmodulated, of corse, even if you lower volume. This includes everything from music, voice samples and menu sounds. Of course you can mute everything by either mute your Quest or access the ingame sound settings. But this defeats the purpose of experiencing a game show.","This was a great improvement on last years experience, the environment and theme had some nice details and was an interesting setting that helped to tie everything together. Entering for the first time after leaving the elevator certainly gave the wow factor and you were immediately encouraged to explore and begin searching for hidden items, I loved the openness of the world, that meant you were able to go anywhere, in any order, I just tended to follow my eyes, which meant the first time, I was like a child, drawn to the tallest most detailed settings first. I was impressed by the effort that a number of developers put into creating their virtual booths, special mentions for Square Enix, Konami, Koei Tecmo, Capcom, Kojima Productions, My Dearest Inc and Character Bank who all had amazing areas to visit. I loved the addition of the Quest to play along with friends as you explored the environments, and the lower level with the history of gaming back to the early 80’s, unfortunately being in Japanese other than the date of release, there was not much I understood here, I wonder if next year a similar theme could have a brief English translation, (I love the artwork, as I did with the TGS posters of last year). The best experience I would take away from this show, would be the social joy of wandering with your friends, also with strangers, I spent 45 minutes in the History of Games gallery, not being able to communicate other than to point at consoles we had owned, with a group of like minded Japanese gaming enthusiasts. I missed the shows that were linked to last years TGS, such as the interviews or announcements, plus the animated performances and this leads me to the improvements I would love to see for next year. The return of the large screen theatre experiences. More interactions More of the scaled modelled characters An expanded Quest Full smooth locomotion The experience to be available for a longer period for more VR gamers to experience it. A huge thank you to all those that put in an amazing amount of effort, for those of us that cannot make it to a TGS this is a great option that i hope gets expanded upon each year and that also other game shows take a chance on the virtual world….. E3… I am looking at you.","I feel this shows an avenue of growth for future expos. As a concept, this is well-done. It has plenty of material, decent graphics, a nice environment to explore, and little ""quests"" to complete to game-ify things. As a game, there were some bugs and glitches. Overall, I spent 90 minutes in this without realizing it. *Thumbs up* (though the expo itself ends Sep 19, 2022 -- not sure if this app will be useful beyond that)"
