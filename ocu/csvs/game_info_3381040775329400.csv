Love the puzzles,"For just 10$ you can get a massive fun experience,with upcoming updates and levels. Really good puzzles or just cool fun stuff. This game made my small playspace feel like a massive dungeon. Overall worth it it's a must have!!!!!!!!!!","TraVRsal walks you around in circles but the remapping that happens when you go around a corner sells the feeling that you’re moving around in infinite space. The larger the play area, the less the remapping is needed. Personally, I think both a maximum guardian size which requires minimal remapping and a minimum size guardian that requires maximum remapping are both kinda cool for different reasons. The larger size guardian feels the most real. However a smaller size guardian kinda creates a fourth dimensional spatial access ￼effect, much like the TARDIS from Doctor Who. Anyways, great platform with some pretty cool games on the platform. I very much recommend it.","think you live in a small place, and all the games you play you have to walk with the joystick, now think if you could walk inside the map walking around your house. Travrsal will break your head, the game uses a system that lets you walk around huge maps using a kind of maze that is calculated based on the space you have in your house. it's impossible to explain exactly how this works but if you play it you'll have an amazing surprise of how the oculus can be much cooler than you thought.",I love that the roomscale is mapped and then you actually walk around in vr. It is a clever use of space mapped so as you walk the halls are joined giving you the sense you are in a much larger play space. It's hard to explain. I highly recommend it. Also there are multiple games in this making use of the technology described above
