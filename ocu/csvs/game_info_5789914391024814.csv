It's still in the early stages and I'm really looking forward to more of it. The scene that's available is just lovely. I find it incredibly peaceful (thank you for making the water translucent, especially the waterfall!) Even the main menu area and the simpler breathing area are nicely done. All contribute to a sense of peace. Besides the beautiful visuals, I very much enjoy being able to create my own music by raising or lowering the volume of the different instruments on offer. That customization is a neat touch that works very well. There are some tweaks that need making, but they're not big deals and I expect they'll be fixed in future updates: in the breathing part, the breaths come too fast. I'd be hyperventilating if I followed the prompts. And just a personal preference, but I'd like the breath sparkles during the exhale to be lower on the 'screen.' Feels like they're coming out of my eyes right now. But these are super minor and aren't worth detracting a star from my review. Overall, a super addition to my meditation library. I see myself using this often alongside Tripp. Can't wait for more portals!","I really love this app and can’t wait to get new content updates! I would be happy to pay for more environments as a DLC. The leaves on the stream are wonderful. Also love customizing the music, day/night, etc. Thank you for creating such a peaceful app.",Very nicely done for what it is. I can see a lot of people wanting to lie down as they do this. You can adjust the background effects/music which is handy for creating the perfect environment! Day and night mode are an option as well. I can't wait to see this app progress.,This app is amazing. The stream meditation is literally the best NLP meditation exercise I have seen in VR. I have paid for apps and got my money back because I didn’t like them as much as this. WELL DONE. And thank you!!!!,A pretty slightly interactive choose your own meditation dealie.
