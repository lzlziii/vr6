Imercyve: Living with Intellectual Disability,"Warning: This experience features flashing images and is not suitable for photosensitive viewers. It's mid-morning, and the sun peaks through blinds into an open-plan kitchen and lounge. A darkened television reflects the rest of the roomâ€”a familiar place, a little unkempt and filled with everyday objects. What would it be like if this recognisable place suddenly became the backdrop for some very unfamiliar challenges? Developed in partnership with support services not-for-profit Mercy Connect, this experience explores the efficacy of an immersive approach to strengthening communication and understanding between advocates and people with a disability by simulating a variety of effects that may be familiar to those with diverse and high care needs. You'll learn through first-hand experience how many of the interactions generally taken for granted may look or feel different other people.",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Narrative, Simulation",English,1.20,Valley General Hospital Pty Ltd,Valley General Hospital Pty Ltd,https://www.valleygeneral.hospital/living-with-disability,"Mar 22, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3580562055398345/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3580562055398345&r=1, https://www.valleygeneral.hospital/imercyve-privacy-policy",482.6 MB,"I was very excited to see an app like this attempting to bring awareness to challenges some individuals face, but I feel the app does not deliver very well. The whole experience only lasts a very short amount of time (like 5 or 10 minutes) so it is hard not to refund it given the price but I am not going to as I really hope they will continue to develop it. But I will say for that price there should be a great deal more content (or a clear indication that the money spent is going to a charity). A free or cheap app would feel more appropriate though to bring awareness to more people. Feedback: There is very little explanation with each experience. I never felt like I gained much insight. I would have liked to know what condition I was about to experience, some explanation about what it is like to have it and then the actual experience of having it. All the experiences lacked much depth and some were just plain confusing. I have no idea what I was experiencing with the tv remote and tv. I assume some sort of sensory overload but if so that did not come across at all. The experiences themselves should have had a goal. I think it would be way more powerful if I had to successfully feed myself, or successfully pick out certain information from the call to accomplish something, etc. There needs to be the pressure to complete something and hardship to do it in order to better feel what an individual with this challenge faces. In the end I think a lot more content needs to be added and VR enthusiasts should be contacted to evaluate and provide feedback before rolling out to the public (would be easy to get people to help for a good goal like this - contact some YouTube creators, many of them are very willing to help or have communities following them that could help)."
