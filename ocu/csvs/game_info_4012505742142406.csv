Neon Blast VR,"This is an exciting VR experience. ""Neon blast"" is an endless shooter where you can enjoy the colorful and unusual neon world. Vizual sound effects make this game even more original. The numbers of shoots is unlimited. But time is limited, it can be increased by shooting at objects. The main thing is don't let the music stop.

There is nothing here! At first the visuals are cool and trippy, but then you realize, hey, this is it. After 1 minute of playing you’ve seen everything the game has to offer. Seriously. Thats it, Nothing happens. No progression, no upgrades, no scenery change. Nada. Zip. It was coma inducing. I just held the triggers in for rapid fire and mindlessly sprayed away at the swimming fish that don’t disappear when you shoot them. But little cubes inside them do. Real satisfying. Oh! Something popped up! Get:50 Hits. Well maybe something happens then. Nope. Get: 100 Hits. Ok, maybe then. I decided to get to 200 hits and then I just couldn’t do anymore. I played for 30 minutes maybe? Or was it 7 hours? I think I drifted off there for awhile. For the last five minutes I had my fingers on the triggers and my eyes closed thinking about what I was going to eat and just randomly moving my hands around. Did I “die”? Did the music end or was I penalized in some way? No. Just said Get:210 Hits and kept on going. Maybe it gets more difficult…eventually. But I certainly didn’t get there. The dishes. I would have had more fun doing the dishes in the sink. That includes a dried out lasagna pan. If you buy this, put an elastic band around the triggers and position the controllers in the centre roughly and then go retile the bathroom. It’ll be more fun and your “score” will be just as high. I DO feel somewhat refreshed after that nap I took playing the game though…","Neon Blast VR is one of my favorite VR games to play. The visuals are amazing, the music is fantastic, and they go perfect together. I'd like to see some gun upgrades in the future, maybe after a certain amount of points, your blasters get a rate of fire increase or something. More themes would be cool too, but the sea life is pretty awesome and I'm completely satisfied with just that. I rate Neon Blast VR 5 STARS!"
