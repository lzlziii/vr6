Z-Race Demo,"Z-Race is a zero-gravity, VR racing game packed with atomic physics, spectacular effects, and innovative gameplay mechanics! Intuitive controls and motion design create a game that provides the racer with little-to-no motion sickness, allowing absolutely anyone to play. The multiplayer experience in Z-Race is designed to assure you’ll always have competitive opponents to play against, and not be stuck with ones that are too slow—or too fast—for your skill level. No matter how good you get at flying Formula Z, you’ll never be alone. The faster you are, the more competitive your rivals will become. A demo of our new Tournament mode in AppLab will allow you to experience the world of VR arcade racing and compete for real prizes.

Since I thought the game was cute I had bought it, but now after some time I didn't have time to play, and therefore to play this game too, I find myself buying it and not being able to use it. I hope you do something as soon as possible to make it again compatible with the various devices and working as before.",Demo not open anymore in oculus quest 2... Trying to reinstall but no help.... It s stopped to working in latest quest 2 system updates. Are you going to update the demo or what is happening??? Is the full version same and game not opening??? Thanks for help...,Oh well.,The game is good but it could it better if you put 1 persion and another Things you cold put support for controller,The game is extremely fun for a demo. It is fun and is kind of hard to put complaints for a demo. Their is one thing that confuses me is that it says invite friends to do a race and I did and we both didn’t see it do something. Overall fun game and is really enjoyable.
