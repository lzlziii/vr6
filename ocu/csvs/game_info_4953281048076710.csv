Solicitude Wake-up,"Solicitude Wake-up takes you to seemingly abandoned research facility. You wake-up in a dark operating room, laying down on operating table. As you start finding your way out from the facility, you start to hear voices coming from other parts of the facility and face all kinds of disturbing things . Your only help is the flashlight, that you found from the room that you woke up, but unfortunately it is running out of batteries. Explore the rooms around the facility and collect batteries to keep your flashlight working! There are key cards to be found and you can access more rooms after obtaining new key card. Avoid the monsters during your way and learn how different monsters work to make your task easier.

Even if the flashlight is turned on, the visibility is poor and the battery limit is strict. I didn't even know how to avoid the aliens. After all, I died many times and couldn't proceed with the game, so I gave up.",It's a good game its so scarry I love playing it,This is Scary done right! Watch this title!,"It’s a great game! But the only thing that is a bummer is when you “die” by being caught but the monsters and you are out back into the main room with the same batteries you died with. I had no batteries left and the big dude got me at the stairs and then I ended up back with no batteries and they weren’t replenished. Kind of made me not want to continue, more so because it was dark and I was just a teeny bit scared HA! But apart from that wish it was easier to find more keycards for the other rooms but I guess that was up the stairs. Still getting used to the game but it’s definitely got a creepy vibe and is good for short game play. Probably not something I would spend hours playing at one time.","This game has potential to be really cool like a VR resident evil but it is way to dark to see anything and sometimes when the monsters appear in the corner of the room theu do nothing I could walk up to him And stroke his face with my hand and say “well aren’t you a scary thing” and then he would just disappear but graphics are dope and the facility is cool and well designed. I think once they get everything worked out though this will be a top tier game it’s just not there yet but as it is , it is not a bad game at all just a little quirky."
