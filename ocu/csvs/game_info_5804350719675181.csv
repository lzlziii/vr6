Mostly the games that aren’t VR aren’t as laggy as the VR games. Developers, please fix the lag. If you do, I would appreciate it. If you do, this game will most likely be one of the best games. Problems: Logging in: if your account isn’t over 13 it won’t let you log onto that account. So if you want to play, create a new account that’s 13+. Lag: You cant really do anything about it yet. At least I don’t think. I hope you found this useful."
