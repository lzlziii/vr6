Simli Lite,"Simli Lite is a limited version of the full Simli experience. Here you’ll get a taste of what the full Simli experience has to offer. Explore one of our simulated social situations and customize your experience using our speech-to-text prompts. In the full Simli app, we have more than 10 social situations you can experience. With Simli Lite, you’ll get to experience a simulated job interview. Before you start, you’ll get to choose what job you’ve applied for and then get relevant questions from the interviewer. The interview will take place in an office with you and one character. Who knows, maybe you’ll get hired? There’s no limit to how much you can test, so go ahead and test as much as you want. That way, we also get valuable feedback on what works and what doesn’t. And hey, if you know someone who needs to practice their job interviewing skills, then share it with them too!

Am I the only one who feels that the Interviewer it's a bit Mean? Feels like I'm unprepared or something haha,"I saw this in a facebook post and I got interviewed for the president of the USA. Probably not what I should use it for but it worked fine, a bit of latency lol",Cool app! Interviewer sounds a little robotic but the questions where relatable and funny,"The ultimate utility of this experience is not getting realistic answers, don't get me wrong, every simulation effort is well done, in my case it was a lot of fun lying to the machine that it understands 1 out of 2 answers provided (as I am available to work yesterday and hearing the joke about using the time travel machine). I think that the ideal would be to add those data that only HR knows and can be very useful, such as better hiding nervousness, the ideal tone of response, or the type of response that is better ""challenged"" that would be useful."
