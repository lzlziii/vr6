There short and fast pace. Love to see in next update to see workouts added of 5 to 10 minuten.,"Can only agree with all the other 5-star reviews, and hope it will stay non-subscription so as many people as possible can enjoy this game in the future. Full version allows perfect adjustment of desired intensity level, as well as use of own mp3's up to 15 mins long. The trailer for the game is really bad though and urgently needs an update ðŸ˜‚","I loved the app it caters well for me as I have health issues and can alter the settings to fit what is comfortable for me. Not all of us want to be top of the leader board and outdo everyone else, but to still get a full workout without being scrutinised. My only issue is I can't buy the full version why is this?"
