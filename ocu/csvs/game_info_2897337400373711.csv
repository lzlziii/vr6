The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners,"Face all the horrors that the living and the dead can offer in this new VR adventure in The Walking Dead universe. Travel through the ruins of walker infested New Orleans as you fight, sneak, scavenge, and survive each day unraveling a city wide mystery within the iconic quarters. Encounter desperate factions and lone survivors who could be friend or foe. Whether you help others or take what you want by force, every choice you make has consequences. What kind of survivor will you be for the people of NOLA? Scavenge for anything that you can weapons, food, tools, and clues. Be wary of the living and the dead: spatial audio will draw attention to any loud noise, bullets or otherwise. Craft makeshift gear out of scrapped material blades, guns, medicine, and more. Survive your way: Use stealth or fight head on. Scavenge or complete jobs for others. Test your morals: make difficult choices for yourself and others.",18+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Horror","English, French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (Spain)",Shipping / 2023.03.19 / build 316225 - STAGE,Skydance Interactive,Skydance Interactive,https://vrwalkingdead.com/,"Oct 13, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2897337400373711/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=2897337400373711&r=1, https://skydance.com/TWDSS-Privacy-Policy/",Terms of Service,7.30 GB,"Graphics: Real life Impressive Good ✅ Decent Nintendo 64 Trash ——————————————————————— Artistic Style: (kind of subjective) Telltale game ✅ God tier indie game Comic 90s shooter Mobile game Too realistic to count ————————————————————————— Gameplay: Titanfall 2 Intense cerebral stimulation 😵‍💫 ✅ Excellent Good Fetch quests x1000 Point and click ————————————————————————— Difficulty: That one level you couldn’t beat when you were 9 years old Dark Souls Tricky Intuitive, but hard to master Easy ✅ Very easy ————————————————————————— Uniqueness: Never been done Original Original concept, generic execution Zombies ✅ WW2 shooter Battle Royale Every game ever 😳 ————————————————————————— Appropriate age: Elderly Adult ✅ Older teen/young adult ✅ Teen/tween ✅ Child (Screaming) toddler Out of the womb ————————————————————————— Fear (common in even non horror vr titles) Sh!tting myself (Good) haunted house film Korean zombies Traditional zombies ✅ (Bad) haunted house film Loud noises Peppa pig Amytiville Horror (sh@te film)","First off I will give my review and after that I will say something to the scaredy cats like I used to be.

Brothers, we must assert our dominance to these zombies and just play the f*#^ing game. No but my 11 year old brother played this game. Once you kill the zombies in the graveyard and in the towns and stuff you will have the best freaking time. This game is so fun. Also if you just bought this game play Arizona sunshine first I played it to get over the fear kinda. But then refund Arizona Sunshine 🌞 10 out of freaking 10. Update: HOW THE FRICK DOES A GAME MADE IN 2020 BEFORE VR EVEN PEEKED STILK THE BEST VR GAME OF ALL TIME WTH I HAVNY PLAYED A BETTER GAME BRO LIKE WHAT?!?!?","Review: Picture this: you're smack in the middle of a zombie-infested New Orleans, desperately trying to scavenge for supplies, fight off the undead, and make moral decisions that would make even Mother Teresa's head spin. And you get to do it all from the comfort of your living room! Who knew the zombie apocalypse could be so convenient?🧟‍♂️ Helpful? Than please press 👍🏻 down below",needs multiplayer SOOOOOO BAAAAAAD i would play this game everyday if there was fricking multiplayer. Story was ssssssss tier because of the ability to kill whoever the f**k you want even if theyre on your side. difficultly is easy unless you make the dumba** decision to go to rampart because it is the hardest map in the game because every f**king door you touch explodes right in your face and you die. the amount of weapons there are is a fantastic feature especially the fact that if you run out of ammo you can bust their head in you can also hang severed heads in your arsenal. awesome game definitely will be buying the second game no doubt. like I said f**king perfection 👌👌👌,Gore: Perfect 🗿 Story: Pretty nice 👌🏻 Zombies: Pretty good 👍 Guns: Perfect down to the littlest details 🤭 Npc’s: Could be better 🫤 Options for story: Good 🫡 DLC: Pretty good 😊(still playing it) Climbing: Could be better 🤦‍♂️ Sounds: Perfect 😀 Melee weaponry: Splendid 🍷🗿 Booms: Results to zombies: 💀 School: TRAUMATIZING 😭
