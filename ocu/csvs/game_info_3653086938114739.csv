BUT without knowing the real force on the club, the simulation of movement, etc. it should always miss on the first few shots. I didn't enjoy a game that I'm going to lose just because the first few pitches were wrong, same with the playing experience on the floor, more than once the money moves in the opposite direction. Overall the game has great graphics and I really enjoy the final experience... until I have to sell a lung to pay off my debt!","I know it's suppose to be a silly fun game wher the odds are stacked against the player , but at least make it a fair game, more than once from with in 2 feet I hit the ball not so hard and it hits it hard enough to pass the hole and land me well pretty dam far and at times I hit it Hard say to reach the eyeball and hits like a tap , then on the other side of the ball we get the bullhorn ur suppose to press as his swing is starting to move forward , you know u got it right when his aim turns red right, it turns red and he make the shot with the fish the downhill pass 2 treadmills and the other fish and also makes the torpedo and the crabs 3 of the most difficult Shots he make with his aim turned red , then I'm up 16k and loose 1 hole and now im down 14 k this scoring method makes no sense, I know u get closet on initial shot is 1k , but then I don't understand how it goes from +16k down to -14k in 1 hole wher we both had 3 putt, i shot first so he pushed is tht worth 30k cause I have not got 30k when I push , so I give yall 1 star and this is how yall want us to pay , to play a game that's not even a fair game, I thought I'd have fun and I did the first 2 game but I played some more and started noticing things , oh I read how yall included diffrent golf clubs as a sledgehammer and other quirky items , I don't know if yall have played mini gulf but you can only use a golf club , never have I seen a place that allows you to play with a sladgehammer or any thing tht is not a golf club , so thats one feature that I believe is intended for kids not adults , which proves my other point , most of yall developer's are making games for kids to play on the oculus , we need more games made for adults, enough of these cartoonish game work on realism please , and make the game fair . Out of all those who rated this game im thr fourth to write a review , unless oculus has deleted sone reviews i believe most played 1 ir 2 rounds and decided to uninstall and forget about it in complete but if yall reading this decide to pay for their unfinished game in beta hold fast until u read one of us 4 who have revied it update and say they made it fair enough to play , unless u enjoy getting rippd off , the by all means buy the game and paypal me the rest of ur savings since u Ike throwing it away üòé","Bombastic, colorful, fun, and silly - just like mini golf should be! What surprised me most is how much I enjoyed golfing against Slick Willie Puttman. Little quips and character banter made the experience feel less lonely and desolate than playing solo in other VR golf games!",This is a good game how could you miss with mini-golf everyone loves it......the in app purchase pricing seems ridiculous to me tho I mean 100+$ for a club?!? So I give it 2 stars,üëç
