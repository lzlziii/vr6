It is so much fun and a blast to play.. the levels are really neat and look amazing. Only one problem so far.. we got to a level and the hands keep getting stuck.. Now we can't do anything and the game won't progress.. I tried reseting and deleting with re install and nothing seems to work.. wish we could fix but don't know how.. other than this happening this game rocked when it worked. Please release a fix... update .. I reseted everything and re updated it.. all works good now.. must of been a glitch or something, but this was the only way to fix it..","Great game with all you need to show off the quest, hand tracking passthrough.
