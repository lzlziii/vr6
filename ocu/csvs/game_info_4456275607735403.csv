I had no idea what was going on. The movement controls are so weird and need changing. I seem to finish a level and I'm just standing there waiting for something to happen, but nothing does. The game feels unfinished and not ready for release. The only good thing is the gun mechanics which feel great. Shame.","WASTE OF MONEY. You can beat every enemy by sitting down. They aim above you, making the game as fun as watching grass grow. I also can't refund this despite meeting the refund requirements",Great fun just played last night.
