But overall a great game with a few tiny bugs and a great experience (Also to anyone who already has this please host rooms I want to play with people) Also use dynamite to explode the safes ;)",I just started playing like an hour ago and my headset died. So I got on later but. I didnâ€™t save my progress. Can you guys fix that?,This is an amazing game and I love it BUT there is one tiny thing that is a little bit annoying the way you change clothes is ONLY in base camp so if I want to change with my friends I have to drag them back to base camp can you please either make houses in every location or make it editable in the menu THANK YOU FOR THIS GAME,"The game sufferes from a severe playability issue. Often times, the game will stick me in the loading screen, and I'll be unable to do anything from there. It happens randomly. It did it to me twice during the tutorial, even once after I had deposited my haul from doing a bounty. There's no way to get out other than reloading the game, and, as far as I know, there's nothing that even should be prompting it. Regardless, the gameplay is fun, and I would play it more if there wasn't an issue as prominent as this. Maybe it's just me suffering from it though, I haven't seen anyone else have this issue yet."
