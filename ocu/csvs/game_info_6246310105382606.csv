Undead Quest Demo,"Undead Quest is a fun single player arcade game where with help of a bat, ball and a few spells, youâ€™ll fight against hordes of funny undead creatures. Hit the ball, cast spells, and move from one beautiful location to another to learn the secret of the undead. You play as a student on a magical university cricket team in a fantasy world. After your team's victory in the tournament semi-finals and a rowdy night of celebration, you wake up in the forest. Barely having opened your eyes, you see a crowd of the undead heading straight for you. A crazy situation even for a fantasy world, frankly. Can you beat the challenges to find out why the undead are here and how to get rid of them? Prepare your hands, feet, and mind - Undead Quest is waiting for you. What does the demo version of the game include: - 7 first levels of the game with great graphics, - 7 enemy characters with their own funny traits, - 2 magic spells that will help you in the battles, - several cut-scenes revealing the general plot of the game, Download, play and share your feedback with us to make one of the best arcade game in VR.",3+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Casual, Sports",English,"1.0

The undead look cute. Defend against waves of undead with a magically charged ball and a cricket lightstick. Sounds simple, however, due to the fact that the ball does not always go where we want (the laws of physics work), the game sometimes turns out to be more difficult than it looks, which is a great plus for the creators. P.S. watch out for glass things in the house when you wave a stick ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",This game sucks do not recommend at all,Undead Quest is a fun game that lets you use your Cricket Skills in order to defend off waves of the enemy Undead. I enjoyed play and find the game to be a workout as well. Overall the graphics have a realistic environments with cartoony characters. The voice acting isnt the best but also is not so terrible where it is painful to listen to. Learning to use the bat is fairly easy but takes a second to figure out how to get the best swing for accuracy. The only negatives i have to say about the game is that it needs to have a way to catch the ball and reset it. I think that will make things alot more friendly instead of just watching the ball fly around until it comes back to you! Make sure to support the developers and give their game a try!!
