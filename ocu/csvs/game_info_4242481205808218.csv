I think the charging for the cross should be faster then everything would be just right. when I beat the game at the end it says episode 1 completed, so im wondering if the devs are going to add more episodes soon or its still in beta. it needs English voice overs as well for those who don't understand the Japanese language. The graphics are great and the environments are well detailed. (lease in my opinion) There's even a boss battle at the end which is pretty cool. I hope it gets updated with all I mentioned above because this is a great title to add to your quest library even if it is short. still worth the price!","I'm giving this four stars because I'm desperate for Japanese horror on the Quest and I did enjoy the setting of this game. A few fun jump scares got me. But there's a bunch of text in the beginning, setting the stage, and a character who talks to you and presumably explains what's happening--but it's all in Japanese. No subtitles for anything despite an English game menu. This makes zero sense to me. I had no idea what was going on :( Yes, it's very short--demo length--but more urgent is fixing the subtitle issue. I could forgive it its shortcomings if I had those. Anyway, hope there will be more J-horror on the Quest.","...the charging of the weapon is so slow, that harder difficulties are unplayable. ...the menu language can be changed from Japanese to English, but unfortunately there are no optional subs during the game itself. ...the game is very short."
