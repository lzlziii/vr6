I love the way that the game works and makes you better every time you restart the level. The game is amazing and I want to thank the developer for making such an amazing game for all of us to enjoy.,"When I first saw it, I honestly didn’t think it was gonna be this good. I mean, just the demo could be paid. Plus, it gets good exercise for you. I would definetly recommend getting it! One thing that’s kind of annoying is how one time, I had gotten on the leaderboard, and when the competition was over, I never got a code for the game. Great game overall, though.","I only have the demo, but the the two levels are pretty good and made me sweat after some time. It’ll be interesting to see what is the in full game."
