There is a light story mode which follows your washing empire. You start off with 3 nozzles and can upgrade them as you get cash for completing jobs. There is something satisfying about seeing the dirt and grime wash away that brings me back for more. I really like how the ledges, handles, and crevices are really dirty in a 3D space and require you to move around to the right angle to clean them. This is a very straightforward game, so it would be nice if had more Easter eggs hidden in the stages to improve replayability . For instance it would be funny if the cat walking around the first stage was black, and you could wash him into another color, or even clean the cars driving around some of the stages. Maybe have other moving objects like birds or UFOs that come in briefly and can be interacted with the water blasts. I also had an itch to break some of the objects in the stage, but they remain static to my water blasting . Maybe there could be a cost (or bonus) for destroying clients belongings . I would have also enjoyed if I could watch or listen to YouTube as the in game music gets old after 15 mins.","I'm really happy with this game. There is no timer, so it can be a relaxing experience. The one problem I'm having is, the game states it's playable by sitting. I'm in a wheelchair so I cannot stand up. On the third or fourth level, there is a parasol that I can't reach the top of to clear it out. Without doing that, you cannot proceed to another level. If there was something to stand on in the level, that would be fine. I would give this game 5 stars if this issue were fixed.","This game is worth it, some kinda zen relaxing vibe to it. Understand that you can teleport on top of some things, you are not told this and you will get stuck if you dont know or forget. I would love a sequel or some DLC. I think a Game+ where you buy soap for hard to clean stuff or a time trial.","Really do love it; but needs a seated mode, game is near enough unplayable from my seating position. Smooth loco and smooth turning would be sweet too, maybe ladders and steps for getting up to high places too. Would provide a far more immersive experience than just teleportation. Really hope you guys are still going to work on this despite Powerwash Simulator VR coming soon",I loved the game. I think the sequence was out of order. I wish the last one was the entire skate park. It was shorter than earlier levels. I would love to see a larger challenging level. Still a great game. Good job
