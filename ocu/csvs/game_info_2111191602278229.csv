So, this game has a little horror in it. If you have bad anxiety, I do not recommend this game. Of course, the game is also hilarious and fun, but once you get further in you have to stick to the more ‚Äúdystopian‚Äù part of the game that can give you a feeling that your about to get jump-scared. And if you don‚Äôt like being scolded by tall robots with no arms named ‚ÄúChaz‚Äù (which is remarkably close to ‚ÄúChad‚Äù) then this might be kinda hard to play. FOR THE DEVELOPERS: Hi! I love your game! But I have a suggestion- you should make a mode where you just get to peacefully try on the ‚Äúfun‚Äù headsets. You can make it so at the loading screen you choose your mode: ‚Äúregular‚Äù or ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù of course, this is just a suggestion the game is fine as is!","VVR is hands down my all time favorite VR game. I could never play something like Resident Evil 4 because it's too scary for me, but VVR was just the right amount of unsettling. I did have to physically take off my headset a few times because I got scared like a wuss, but I quickly went back in because I knew nothing would come running at me, and the game always gave me time to compose myself and think about my next move. The fact that there were no cheap jump scares or chases is what allowed me to play this game, even though it had a few elements of horror. I'd say it's more akin to a mind-screwing thriller than a straight up creepy-girl-in-the-closet horror. The visuals, music, and voice acting were also amazing. As an office worker, I also found it awesome just how well they wrote Chaz's corporate lingo script, because he reminded me so much of one of my real managers. Most of the few bad reviews come from folks who didn't understand what to do in the game, but it's actually really intuitive if you think about it as your own jail break instead of a video game. Also, they could have easily looked up the guide or a playthrough to see how to get past it but instead they stop playing. If you're looking for a beginner friendly game with a dystopian story for you to uncover at your own pace, VVR is perfect for you. I seriously can't recommend this enough and I give massive props to the creators and anyone involved with its making.","really good game, great storyline, soundtrack, characters, etc. i don‚Äôt really rate games that much, but this game is special. everyone who rated it 1 star was either stuck at the butter loop or just didn‚Äôt understand how to play. so many hidden easter eggs as well, can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve replayed. very cool game, play now!!!!!!! :3",I thought this game would just be a fun goofy game like Job Simulator but wow was I wrong! This game is great and I highly recommended it! For twenty-five percent off of this game and many more visit l i n k t r [dot] e e [slash] l u c e n t s p o o n,This is a genuinely great game and I love the story and art style of the game.
