With bonus future like adding, sounds and music to each room, easy controls, and ease of use, my sister, who never uses VR, felt like home, and started to use it like a pro. Well done.",Working on a kitchen extension for our home and discovered Sentio...amazing. We used someone from Fiver to turn our plans into a sketchup model then uploaded to Sentio. Able to view the kitchen extension as if we were actually there and work out best place for oven etc and best layout of tables chairs and furniture as well as 'flow' of the space. Impossible to say how useful this is until you try it!,"SentioVR is one of those tools that are synonymous with the future of The virtual world. From model walkthroughs to 360 tours, it is a simple tool communicate design intent and to place the end-user in the space. The future is bright and with so many new features that can offer in the future, I see a user experience that places you in the immediate context of the virtual environment with on the spot feedback. This is certainly the tool of the future.","I designed my next apartment floorplan in SketchUp and used SentioVR to view the space. Getting my SketchUp project synced and live to open on my Meta Quest 2 standalone was very easy, you just need to install their extension plugin for your CAD app of choice. It helped me better visualize the space and easily share that experience with others.","Very nice and intuitive software, simple, easy to handle, no need to be a specialist, what makes it attractive is the possibility to load your projects once you 've finished editing your 360Â°Tours and creating your 3D Model and start touring via the App in your Oculus Quest Headset! so cool! Honestly there is much to do here when one knows what they want. The SENTIO Team is very helpful! Good job, keep improving."
