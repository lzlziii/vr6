Maybe a slider to select the angle. That would be nice. Otherwise, it's nice to just sit down and feel like a genius as you solve some of the most visually satisfying puzzles ever.","The game is well-designed, but should allow access to all six levels. I was stuck on level 3 and consulted the developer and YouTube to figure out how to pass it. This was very helpful and I was able to get pass the level. Puzzle games stimulate critical and creative thinking skills.","There’s nothing I can say that would illuminate this game more so than all of the other 5 star reviews. What I want to know is, Developers, will there be updates, extra levels, anything? I’ll take extra music tracks too. That’s right, this game has incredible music. But seriously, I’d appreciate more levels and will gladly pay for them. I have to say, this game is needed for people like me with mental disorders. It focuses and calms me at the same time. Please bring more. 🙏🙏🙏 I hope this is not spamming you as it’s on the bottom of the review, but should you find this helpful, please consider using my lnk below. Thank you! 🙏❤️🙏✌️ it’s %25 off. Just change the comma to period and backspace everything.

Cant wait for more!,"First off I like the gameplay. At times it is nice to just relax, the music is nice, and do some thinking without too much going on. Played it for half a hour and don't really see myself returning to it much in the future. The puzzles are good and get you thinking at times, but it kind of gets boring although new things are introduced into the gameplay. But from my standpoint it would be better suited as a flat game(I know it has been for a few years) rather then VR, which brings nothing in VR that is worth talking about. Just don't see the point of wearing a headset to play this for any length of time. Flat then I would play it more as a quick time filler."
