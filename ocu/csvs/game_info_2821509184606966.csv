AREA MAN LIVES,"UPDATE: We are happy to announce that AREA MAN LIVES is a: + ""BEST NARRATIVE GAMES OF 2022"" OFFICIAL SELECTION ON THE QUEST STORE + VENICE INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL 2022 OFFICIAL SELECTION + CANNES XR 2022 OFFICIAL SELECTION AREA MAN LIVES. Or does he? If you could join a radio drama already in progress, talk to the characters and interact with the environments the story painted in your mind, you might find yourself in the world of the area man. A quirky radio drama unfolds around you in VR while you do your best to keep the radio station humming along as its new DJ. You record commercials, interview callers and try your best to piece together how your actions inside the station impact your listening audience in scenarios so wild they can only live in your imagination. If it all feels like too much, don’t worry, you’ll have your lonely producer, the resident skeptic, to guide you on your way, not to mention the vaguely British female voice inside your head. When an unusual area man calls into the station asking for your help, you have to act fast. Will you trust the area man, or do your best to thwart his plans? Is there anything you can do to save the area man from himself?",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Interactive Story, Puzzle",English,1.2.4,Numinous Games,Cyan Ventures / CityLights,http://areamanlives.com/,"May 12, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2821509184606966/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=2821509184606966&r=1, https://areamanlives.com/privacy-policy/",536.4 MB,"I remember messing around on steam on my computer looking at games when I stumbled upon this, Area Man Lives. I wishlisted it then never thought any more about it, until I was looking at the new games on the meta quest store and saw it again. I decided to buy it to try it out and it exceeded my expectations. Not only does it let you talk back, but that can drive the story. I thought it would be a visual novel where you sat and watched stuff happen but it was way more interactive than I expected. Good job Devs. The only thing I would recommend is to update the grip points, some of them are really weird Best of luck to your dev dreams.","Honestly I've never been so stumped in a game in my entire life. The voice function is cool, but it often misinterprets what you're saying, and sometimes when I've responded positively to something the game acts like I've said something negative (for example, hank asking if I wanted to hear a joke, I said yes but game thought I said no), it could be implemented in more aspects of the game I think, its not used all that often or in a fun way except at the beginning. Now the gameplay can be incredibly confusing. Fun story and the voice actors are amazing, dialogue is witty and interesting (I like the option to skip dialogue previously heard from the pause menu) but a bit irritating at times. Solutions to puzzles are sometimes so out of the box its simply just picking everything up, moving it around, then going onto the next thing (which given the time can be a case of picking up a few things, failing and listening to his death on the radio, then rinse and repeat till you get it, often resulting in 4 or 5 or even more tries at the same level just picking up anything that's not nailed down). That being said, it's satisfying when you do finally figure it out, and it's sometimes just a case of listening very carefully to what they're saying for a clue. It's a very fun game, while annoying at times (especially cause I cannot find a walkthrough or even a hint guide online) it's still very fun to play, it's unique, and the different endings are fun to get. As of writing this, I still cannot find John's wife despite visiting every location on the map, and can't find any help online. Overall, I'd say play it, its worth it. I think there should be a longer part where you play as a radio DJ than a travel guide though, the intro was fun",I started playing to the game heard steps on the roof now I’m wondering if I’m getting jump scared can someone tell me ￼,"I really want to enjoy this game. It sounds like my kind of game! However, it glitches almost every time I open it and am in the middle of trying to solve a task (ie, record stuck on record player, object I’m holding goes outside the room but is stuck on being held, unable to grab items I should be able to grab (pencils). I dislike I have to go through the same start up sequence every single time open the game (the alert for needing microphone and 360 degree view for play—unnecessary). I also dislike having to sit through voice sequences. I wish I could skip through bc the dialogue takes forever (especially since I can read it instead), and sometimes I’ve heard the dialogue already (like on a previous play through). It’s a bit of a busy game at times, so having the radio play while trying to do something while hearing conversation or narration is a bit much for me when I’m already feeling overstimulated.",it’s a fun game in theory but it’s buggy tbh and sometimes super confusing
