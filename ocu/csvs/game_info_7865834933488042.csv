It’s just all around a pretty good game. While it definitely needs work I love playing and can’t wait to see what more they do with it. Moreover the developers are very active in the community and genuinely wanna help improve the game.","What can I say, except, it's a great game. An AMAZING game if you were like me as a kid, waving sticks around pretending you were a wizard just like every fantasy movie out there. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc. Except now, you can REALLY see the spells and their effects as you do battle against your opponent. The game is SO fun and as a wide variety of compents to spell casting, all while staying simple for anyone to be able to play. So come and have fun with us!",I try this game with the free trial of 20 minutes. What can i say expect that it’s really addictive. Winning just by strategy is so satisfying ! Letting your opponent casting all his summon spells while your preparing a nuke is really fun x) !,Real fun
