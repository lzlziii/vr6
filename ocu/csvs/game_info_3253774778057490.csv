Touchy Feely,"This is the first draft of a system I want to use to build experiences with hand tracking, it features - touch response, this is colour and sound for temperature and pressure - custom shader, I'm learning shader graph and want to make a battered comic book style What I hope to do - create a small short story in this space, about someone packing down the apartment of a loved one that has passed away. - polish the grab and feedback mechanics based on some feedback - add teleport and explore hand based teleport - work on more natural engaging interactions I'm making this public to get a read on the grabbing and the art style, I still want to add audio and polish the mechanics. My goal is also to create technical and creative experiments and share them. I want to publish often and develop in public!
