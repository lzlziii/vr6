I was only able to play for a few minutes before I started sweating and feeling very sick. The motion sickness was so severe that I had to lie down and sleep. I looked for a setting in the app that would allow me to adjust the comfort level, but I couldn't find one. I would really appreciate it if the developers could add this option, as I really want to be able to play the app all the way through without feeling sick.","First, thank you developers for this relaxing stress free game, fitness exercise at the same time. 🙏🙏💪😊 . Everyday I do my 30 minutes paddle in this relaxing exercise. I just paddle arounds each the islands 🏝 , enjoy the night time with the moonlight and stars . How about add more FX effects, rains or snow if good idea. Please continue to add more island if possible. Thank you.",I always go into this game thinking I'll just do a few minutes but end up getting motivated to do more than I anticipated because I see some wildlife or a new island or a new game. Thanks for adding content and making this a decent core and arm workout.,"The most immersive game to date with the realistic physics and zen like atmosphere. It truly feels like you are there. The developers adopt a friendly and helpful approach. Despite SUP Island being in early development, I find myself coming back repeatedly due to the different activities and all -round use of the game. A perfect place to de stress, have fun or use for fitness purposes!","I enjoy SUP in real life, and really appreciate the convenience that this game brings me. Sometimes the weather outside isn't appropriate to SUP, or maybe I just need a few minutes of paddling to relax. The physics are pretty accurate and the mini-games in the latest update are fun. I wish there was a setting to turn off the music though. Sometimes I just want to hear the water splashing. Also, an area where you can have timed runs at certain distances would be nice. Maybe 100m, 200m, 500m, and 1km with the game saving your best times."
