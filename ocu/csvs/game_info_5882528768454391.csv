And it does innovate the formula with cool power ups. The atmosphere is also very interesting with a pandora box that sucks inside all then monsters when the player dies. For now I played only for one day so I didn't saw the whole experience but I really had tons of fun. The only problem was in the tutorial maybe should be checked for a patch because when it ask the second task, to move and and slide to go faster, I couldn't procede well, maybe I had to stay in the red floor zones but I was teleported to start I didn't understood well what to do. Sometimes I was teleported behind the rocks in the void. I passed the tutorial without clearly understanding how. Thx a lot for this game, it's very cool.","The update from yesterday added an intro sequence with a (much needed) tutorial and some story. The hub is updated and in general Pandora is feeling and looking very clean and polished. This game has a locomotion system that I haven't seen before, pretty intriguing. It makes the circle strafing you're bound to do feel completely new. The rounds will be very short while you're still getting the hang of everything, like me ðŸ˜‚ I hope to get some good long runs someday!","Loving the new updates, this game is on its way up!","As an experienced gamer, I'm always on the lookout for unique and challenging games to play, and this VR game did not disappoint. The game was easy to learn, yet it offered a level of difficulty that kept me coming back for more. One of the standout features of the game was its intuitive controls. The game did an excellent job of introducing me to the various mechanics, allowing me to quickly get into the action without feeling overwhelmed. However, as I progressed through the game, I quickly realized that mastering these mechanics would not be easy. The game's difficulty curve was perfectly balanced, offering a steady progression of challenges that never felt too easy or too difficult. I found myself constantly being challenged and forced to adapt to new situations. Overall, this VR roguelite game was an absolute joy to play. If you're looking for a fun and challenging VR game that will keep you coming back for more, I highly recommend giving this one a try.","Just recently I thought: ""Wouldn't it be great to adapt the classic Devil Daggers for VR?"". Well, I must have been heard as Pandora is almost Devil Daggers VR! Here my comparison: - hard to figure out the game without a tutorial/control scheme. I still don't know what to do with the gems. - the sound design could be improved. audio cues for the enemies were very good in DD but are even more important in VR - the weapon felt far more powerful in DD. the particles look odd and the sound could be improved. time to kill was far shorter in DD, too - I like the idea of utilizing the left hand for ""grab to dash"", but a combination with stick based free move could feel less awkward. precise movement was a top priority in DD - enemies might utilize more vertical space. especially the eyes â€“ which block the view â€“ could perhaps be floating higher up? - the level feels quite cramped. I'm not sure, but the ""red out"" when you move too far could be a bit more forgiving? - the gems should be more visible - perhaps they should be pure red without the blueish shader Â° in VR, perhaps it would be a great improvement over DD to be able to use both hands (for shooting and grab to dash). if its not compatible with your idea of the base game, perhaps add this as a game mode + the visual design is unique and the particle effects are on quite a high level for a Quest + love the idea of opening pandoras box and the ominous setting + its very challenging, and thats how it's supposed to be! ... this might sound very critical, but I know this game is still in an early stage of development so just take it as suggestions for improvement. This game has the potential to become a top wave shooter and a personal favourite. Good job, please continue!"
