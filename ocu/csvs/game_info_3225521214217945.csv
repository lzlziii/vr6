Killer Pool Preview,"This is a preview of an in-development pool game. It's been built especially for Oculus VR and lets you step into the UK pub pool scene. In this preview, you can practise on the small pub table, nicknamed 'The Matchbox'. The full game will feature winner-stays-on EPA rules & Killer Pool, plus more is planned for the future.

I like having a pooltable in my house. I place the pooltable on a real table in my house so i can rest my hand on it when i play. Here are some thing you might improve even more; 1. Resize the table so everyone can place it on the dinnertable 2. Its hard to shoot hard. That good be a little easier. Spark ball pool has good controls 3. There is a poolgame where you have a screen in the vr world where you can watch youtube. That really great while playing pool. See black 8 hole pool Keep up the great work. Iâ€™m going to play alot in my house nowðŸ¤©,Fave stars,"I know this is still under develpoment but i found it very hard to get to grips with. the cue is dificult to use as the you line it up with one hand then ""grip with your back hand and you are in a compleatly diferant location from where you lined up. moving around the table is very dificult to get the hang of. when you go to hit the ball the strenght you put in is not translated into the game.this game has potential but need a few things addressing, I could only play it for a few minuets before i started getting frustrated. I will be keeping an eye on this and see what improvements come along",It was not the game for me itâ€™s hard to use cue and becomes quite dull after a couple minutes,It's really hard to use the cue. They need to make it easier to use the cue otherwise not many people will enjoy it. I'm not a fan of this at all
