The customers are unique and funny and don't complain...too much. There is a tutorial that shows how to use your tattoo equipment and is pretty easy to follow and learn. It is really fun being a tattoo artist. This is a really unique game and should be in VR. I look forward to future improvements to make ganeplay even better!","Great start and so much potential in this game. Would be cool to be able to move the person being tattooed into better positions rather than just sat in one place, sometimes I was finding myself leaning a lot to be able to reach them. Perhaps a drop down list of set positions? Perhaps set positions on the floor, for someone who gets motion sickness id rather not have to move ðŸ˜‚ A larger selection of needles, thinner if possible? More designs would be cool too. Other than those great concept!",Thank you for fixing the crashes! Iâ€™m super impressed with the accessibility settings. Anyone with color blindness you will be taken care of! I guess my only request at this point is for more finer needle weight as I find the smallest one too thick to make nicer designs. Great start though! Graphics are fantastic
