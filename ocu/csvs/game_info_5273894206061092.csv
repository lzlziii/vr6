Very similar to Geometry wars, in feel and pace, but with a progress system that gives you much more firepower. Ace for a quick blast, or so you think after your 50th utterance of 'just one more go' ü§£ At the price, this is an absolute steal!","Classic Feel With Classic Sounds! Amazing & Priced Right! Gameplay is bob on, tough but not that tough you don't come back. Leader Boards are alive & rocking with Me & other players jostling for top positions! GGs","This is a simple Geometry Wars style arcade shooter on Quest. Games like this and Vampire Survivors are big now. That said, I bought this because the dev is small and mentioned in another review that they might add more visual flairs to make this more exciting in VR. More 3D and effects. If that's the case, here's my support. Go effects crazy, please!","This is a lot of fun and keeps you coming back to beat your score or climb the leaderboard. Looking at the video before playing, I was hoping for more 3-D effects to take advantage of the VR, but that is a minor quibble. Well worth the asking price!!",Awesome little retro rogue-lite space shooter. Just one more game!!! ü§£üëç
