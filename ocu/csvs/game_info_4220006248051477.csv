It's super cheap for being such a full game. The maps are huge and don't hold back when it comes to scale for scenery. The fighting mechanics take some getting used to if you come from games like B&S or Battle talent but I try not to compare cause those two, at least rn, are completely different games from this one. This is what I was craving for grandeur and adventure and story!","Finally feels like a full game (by modern day standards) has made it to the quest. Makes other quest games seem shallow and incomplete by comparison. Definitely worth full price! Or get it 25 prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot): b i t , l y / w a o s","After Warhammer 40k: Battlesisters, I really had my hopes up. But sadly, this game does not even get close. The graphics and the mechanics are both lacking severely. The storyline and story telling are dull and boring. The melee combat mechanics are horrible. It all feels very unnatural. The environmental textures are poor and unimaginative. Itâ€™s not the worst game out there, but it really is a big step down from itâ€™s 40k predecessor.","This would have been an xbox360 game back in the day in my opinion. at first it seems a little bit empty, when you reach the city even feels like you are constantly going back and forth through the same street, then everything spikes up, it goes like one dungeon after another, you will see some cool looking places, the city will feel like a massive multilevel dungeon, its not open world by any means but there is a sense of scale that will be building up as you play. I was surprised by the fact that no place feels repeated, the places you will go share a common thematic and architecture but are otherwise unique, so every dungeon will feel new as something negative there is little leveling up and very few weapons and abilities , very few types of enemies aswell you may get lost in the city part of the game as there is no indication of where you should go, is as you are really on your own searching for the next dungeon but the places alone make this a worthy recomendation","Just started the game and Iâ€™m enjoying it so far, my only complaint is that the weapon handling feels a big floaty and I find it slightly difficult to swing downwards, though I may just be spoiled by Blade and Sorcery on that front ðŸ˜…"
