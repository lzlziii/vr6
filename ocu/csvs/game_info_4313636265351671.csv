Looking forward to objects,It was Ight at first but with the new update it really shows where the game could take off in the future,"This is a very cool game with amazing features, 10/10","The game is good, the problem is when I'm trying to punch them in the air I go forward and I get stuck in the air and can't move, you can't do much In the game but do the training area and unlock cash and get items, not even the gloves you can get, your cash doesnt even save either, I hope this game can get more features soon.",So I‚Äôm not going to mention any bugs that I‚Äôve seen already in the reviews plus this game is in development so yeah I‚Äôm sure they know what‚Äôs up. Every fix or feature just takes time to implement. With that out of the way; something I did notice that wasn‚Äôt said was that the other rooms or portals were locked and the only room was the training room. I can only assume they‚Äôre already implemented because they say locked and not under construction or under development. This means that for me anyways there‚Äôs a big difficulty curve to beat the first room. I still haven‚Äôt been able to beat it and idk how many there are before you do. Also I don‚Äôt really know what the charge ability does. I can see it charging but idk if I‚Äôm supposed to move my arms from the charging pose to punch or throw my hands forward or what. I feel like that could be a little more clear with an explanation. Overall amazing game with mind bending art. I really like the idea and I can‚Äôt wait to see what the devs decide to do next with it!
