It‚Äôs usually multidisciplinary. One thing in common to all of these games is that they lack in realism. The climb basically doubles down and says THIS IS THE ONLY EXPERIENCE! And they do a really really good job at it. This game is jaw dropping to first users of VR and it still inspires awe in me, even though I‚Äôm used to heights by now. Each level is true to its difficulty and your arms will get a workout for sure. You have to leave them in all sorts of angles until you can move forward again. It takes some getting used to, and I‚Äôm not sure how many calories you‚Äôre burning or muscle building you‚Äôre doing if at all (I work out most of the week doing swimming, body lifting and yoga) and I can tell you it gets difficult in hard mode. The graphics are as good as they can get (maybe not like Real VR Fishing or Brink Traveler) on the Quest, meaning realistic, intricate, but like all real-life depictions on the Quest, grainy!

Every level is different and each is as good as the last. If always feels like a workout to play with how immersive it is! Nothing bad to say about this game, I love that there is the option to make a level easier is needed and that there is so much scenery in each level, it feels so real!","This isn't a game, it's an EXPERIENCE! Several different locations with several different difficulties on each climb. I never thought I would like or be good at this, but I really enjoy it. You would be surprised at how much of a workout the Climb can be! Your arms and shoulders will get tired climbing up the side of a mountain even if you are just sitting in a chair in your living room. There is plenty of replay ability because each run has several different ways to get to the top. Some are fairly easy, and some are extremely difficult. I would not recommend this app for those who are bothered with heights or falling. I will be buying The Climb 2 when I finish this game.","Visit linktr,ee/gaving7095 for 25 % off this game and many more üòÄ Lovely graphics, fun climbing mechanics, plenty of stages and it‚Äôs also a good work out :-) They only thing which brings this game down slightly is the existence of it‚Äôs awesome sequel! If you only buy one of them, the sequel is the one to go for.",I‚Äôve had this game pretty much since the quest two came out and have liked it a lot. Wait for it to go on sale if you are not an insane fan of climbing but like the game.
