I like how you can use hand tracking which works well and makes it even more relaxing.,"So many great things about this. I love the fact that you can choose different amounts of total puzzle piecesâ€¦ the music is perfect and very relaxingâ€¦ I love the fact that you can add your own images and create puzzles from thoseâ€¦ picking up pieces, setting them in place, and putting them back are all simple and intuitive actionsâ€¦ and you gotta love the fact that this is only $4.99. Bravo to the developer!ï¿¼ï¿¼",I downloaded this game and i cant even download or refund it ðŸ‘Ž,"I love that you're IN the puzzle/environment that you're also recreating on a smaller scale. I love the variety of puzzles/images/places. I prefer this puzzle app way more than Puzzling Places (those puzzles are things/objects and there's no ambience, you're just putting the puzzle together in a void). Beautiful photos.",Love that you can download any picture and make it a puzzle. You can choose how many pieces you want and if you want a round or flat puzzle. I wish the directions were better but was able to figure out pretty quickly you can move the puzzle closer to you by grabbing the little round sphere(ball?) and pulling. You can also download more puzzles by choosing browse and it will open the browser for you which makes it pretty easy. Easily worth the price!
