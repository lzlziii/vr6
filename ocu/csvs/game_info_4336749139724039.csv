Initially, I compared it to Supernatural, which I was paying for at the time, and I hated it. The aesthetics were ugly and not as polished as Supernatural, but I was tired of paying for Supernatural. I loved that PowerBeats was free and I could work out to my own music, so I moved back to the app. When the developers updated the app and allowed users to add custom backgrounds, everything changed for me. There's something about working out to your own music in a visually appealing environment that makes me happy. I love that the developers let the users customize their own experiences, and they welcome feedback from the community on Discord. The menu is still ugly, but I definitely enjoy the app much more now.","I was looking for something to replace my Supernatural subscription with. I didn‚Äôt like anything as much. I really appreciated the Supernatural for beautiful environments. Therefore I was never getting tired of it. However, i want to cut down on monthly subscriptions. I couldn‚Äôt find anything quite as good until I came across the PowerBeats. I‚Äôm in love! üíìüíóüíì Extremely happy it is one time purchase because I don‚Äôt want to pay any subscriptions on VR as im not using it often enough. The PowerBeats gives me the exact vibe i was looking for. And, of course, I got an add-on with 20 more environments and the fact that i can actually use my own 360 environments and My own music is priceless. Also, I appreciate how adjustable all the settings are and that it gives you a full body workouts when desired. I love that i can jump on my rebounder while doing some of these workouts. Kudos to developers and to product owners. In my opinion, This is one of the best fitness app. And i tried out everything that is currently available on the quest.",I initially brought my VR purely because I saw this app to help get me moving. Once I set up my Oculus this was the first app I brought and it has truly delivered. This has been getting me moving and the amount of motivation I feel after giving this a go has got me up everyday and looking forward to keep going.,When I first got my VR I was obsessed with Beat Saber because it combines two of my favourite things; Light Sabers and Music. Then when I downloaded Power Beats it was nice to have something different to play that was still a good work out and I would switch back and forth between the two until I discovered that I could add my own music and backgrounds and customize my entire work out essentially making it my favourite game and a great work out it‚Äôs so enjoyable you forget that your working out!!!!,"Right, you want to loose some weight? Well I am using this app and to be honest. It is one of the best out there. All you need to do is purchase it once. Done. You can work out to your favorite music, whenever you feel like it. The universe is your limit. You can choose where you want to work out. Choose your workout level, and watch yourself grow through experience. Seriously, it's everything. I really love the fact I do not need to subscribe. Nothing but perfection! Mo"
