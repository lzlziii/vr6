Lasertag Legends,"Lasertag Legends is a multiplayer lasertag game. The action takes place in a colorful, neon lit lasertag arena sometime in the near future. Choose a team, get in the arena and start fragging! Each frag helps push your team up the league table. At the end of the season, one team will be crowned champions of the Royal Lasertag League. Lasertag Legends features 3 main modes: Multiplayer Modes: - The Main Stage: Battle it out against other players in the Lasertag Legends Arena - The Cube: Practice your aim by battling against other players in a small map Singleplayer Mode: - Dino Hunt: Survive against a vicious hoard of holographic dinosaurs Need a break? Head to the lobby to hang out, watch a concert, change your tagger or check out your stats. The game places a focus on teams instead of individual stats. Choose from one of 20 lasertag teams. Once you choose a team, all your frags contribute to your team's overall score. In the lobby, you can see the league table and where each team stands. At the end of the season, one team will be crowned champions. See you in the arena.",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer",Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Shooter",English,1.2,Team Royal,Team Royal Games,https://lasertaglegends.com/,"Dec 1, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5350443918326399/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5350443918326399&r=1, https://lasertaglegends.com/privacypolicy",711.5 MB,Pew pew ðŸ”«ðŸ’¥,Everyone writing reviews here needs to keep in mind that these are all mostly games in some stage of development. It is patently unfair to compare them to million dollar efforts coming out of the BIG publishers that likely just bought one of these games and 'finished' it. I think this is a great game for it's niche. Not everyone wants to play complex ultra real blood and guts games. I like the less complex hunter/killer style of this program a lot. I can focus on stalking. I also think it has a lot of promise for future releases.,I got the game for free from Reddit and that nice of you guys and itâ€™s a pretty good game so try it out Some weird bugs or it crashes donâ€™t know why so 4 stars,"There's great graphics. But the game itself is boring and not fun, It would be better if the story of the game changed and made it realistic"
