Fractured Sanity,"You wake up in a cell in the Triton Institute, an experimental asylum headed by the decorated psychologist, Dr. Matthew Simmons. Recently, there have been rumors of abuse and inhuman working conditions within the clinic; furthermore, it seems most of the staff has gone missing. Nobody knows any details, except this: Dr. Simmons has been conducting research into the tripartite psyche, as proposed by Freud, and how to break someone's id, ego and superego apart. How far has he gone? In this short but intense VR experience, interactive physics-based puzzles mixed with survival horror elements bring an immersive atmosphere of tension and relief. Are you ready to survive in this strange place?",16+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Horror, Puzzle",English,1.11,United Games,United Games,https://fracturedsanity.unitedgames.com.br/,"Mar 27, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5347273738669610/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5347273738669610&r=1, https://fracturedsanity.unitedgames.com.br/privacy-policy/",843.7 MB,"Search for 'Ballsy VR' on YouTube to find my first impressions video review (you can't post URLs on here anymore, sorry)! I played the first 30 minutes so far, and I'm already captivated by the story and the mysteries left to unravel. The puzzles are really cool (especially liked the light-based one, and the 'handy' scanner, haha), and the horror is tense and creepy.
