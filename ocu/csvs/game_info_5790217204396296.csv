The basis of the game is good, I like the idea, the gameplay works, and there is at least short-term enjoyment. But there are a few points that don't fit... There is music in the menu, but there is no music at all during the game! Without music all that's left are the game sounds, which are monotonous and soon become annoying. Physics is somewhat weird. For instance, when you fully hit a ball onto the ground, it doesn't bounce as high as it should. I love the size change of the balls, but the multiball is completely pointless, it's impossible to hit two oder more balls. There's only one game mode, I would like more game modes here (e.g. levels with tasks and challenges). This way, there's just a lack of variety, and long-term motivation is not given. In short: A nice game for little money, but there's still work to be done on the game - similar games like Masternoid, Cybrix, or VRkanoid do it better (music, fun, levels, and motivation). 2,5/5 stars","ABSALUTLY GENIUS I WANTED A GAME JUST LIKE THIS AND WOW CAME ACCROS IT , ABSALUTLY EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED, I can't stop playing it . It's brilliant especially when the balls get bigger ,such fun game and also because there isn't anything else like it .I really hope the maker of the game can add lots more to this game , like different targets , balls bats , ect ect . It would be awsome . Ide recommend this game to everyone its very addictive for a pick up n play game and what a bargain at ¬£3.99 the graphics are ace too üëå"
