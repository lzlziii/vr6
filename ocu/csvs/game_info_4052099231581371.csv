Incredible puzzle, good story and graphics the mechanics are soooo cool and well done and the music fits perfectly! It‚Äôs so satisfying to play this game and see all your clones work at the end of every levels! I follow the team from back when the game was called help yourself and I wanted to thank each and every person of the dev team for their hard work and the incredible game they gave us ! Don‚Äôt hesitate it‚Äôs not that costly for a Vr game of this quality and a sandbox and player created levels are on the way !!","Text me for a 25 off code. REVIEW Super cool idea and executed super well, love the art style and the wide variety of items that you use as you progress, when I first started out I was thinking that it was gonna be to easy but as you go on it gets much harder and is so fun. Highly recommend this game and don't forget to text me for the code.","I currently own well over 150 Quest games. If you are considering purchasing this game (or others on Quest) click on my pic and then ‚Äúchat‚Äù to DM me as I can help reduce the price you pay. (See the end of my review for more help). What a neat game!! Imagine cloning yourself & using your clones to help save you. Add a timer into the mix and you‚Äôve got yourself an out of the box experience. If you have played the Last Clockwinder you‚Äôll definitely love this game too. If you haven‚Äôt tried it you are sure in for a great time! The game gently introduces you to the concept of ‚Äúhelping yourself‚Äù and then keeps stepping up the complexity. You really have to think through your plans, positions and sequence in the most fun way. You are literally drawn into constantly wanting to better your speed time & time again. A truly clever clever game - well done to the developers! I hope you enjoyed my review ‚Äì considering clicking the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù button! üëç All my links can also be found on - l i n k t r . e e / b l i s s 2 1 2 1 (just remove all the spaces).","‚úÖ tiny,cc/xcm7vz ‚úÖ I‚Äôve been waiting for this game since playing the demo. This is one of the most unique VR games I‚Äôve played. You work together with clones of yourself to complete the different levels. Combined with the amazing scenery and graphics and the awesome gameplay, this game offers a lot of replay value and is definitely worth it! üî´üå±üåøüå≥üçÉ",Great game can't get enough puzzle solving and it's just gorgeous to look at just started the main game but have had my eye on this one since seeing it in the lab but if u still can't make up your mind check out a video or 2 on it and see for yourself I know I'll b doing a story play though ITS JUST THAT GOOD
