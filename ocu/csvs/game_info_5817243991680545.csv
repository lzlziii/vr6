Into the Radius,"An atmospheric open-world single-player survival shooter. You find yourself in the middle of the blighted zone, cut from the outside world.

Navigate with your realistic map, plan your route, climb over obstacles, scout out shelters, uncover loot caches, and try not to get killed. At least not too often. ✔Collect and fire realistic guns Realistic interaction with a stunning variety of firearms like the AKM Kalashnikov, PM Pistolet Makarova, SKS Carbine, M9 Beretta, PPSh, FN SCAR, and many more. ✔Survive by all means Navigate the terrain, move slowly, take cover, crouch, sneak, and beware of the threats around you!",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Horror, Shooting","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish (Spain)",2.6.4,CM Games,CM Games,https://cm.games/games/into-the-radius-vr/,"Sep 8, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5817243991680545/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=5817243991680545&r=1, https://cm.games/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,4.44 GB,"Graphics: ❎️ Is this even a game?! ✅️ Pretty good ❎️ Meh ❎️ My 3 year old cousin made it ❎️ A monkey made it ❎️ Not realistic but still is beautiful Gameplay: ✅️ Incredibly fun ❎️ Decently fun ❎️ It will keep you entertained for a while ❎️ You can do a few things but not much ❎️ I can't even play it's so boring Fear Factor: ❎️ I'm going to need a change of pants ✅️ I'll be shaking the whole time playing ❎️ It is a bit freaky ❎️ I won't feel shaky ❎️ Not scary at all Replayability: ❎️ Rougelike ❎️ Multiple endings ❎️ I can play daily ❎️ A few times a week ❎️ Once a month ❎️ One and done ✅️ Only a story Difficulty: ❎️ You will rage quit ❎️ Can make you mad ✅️ Occasionally will tick you off ❎️ Get mad once in a while ❎️ Easiest thing ever Music: ❎️ Incredible, could listen to daily ❎️ Good ✅️ Listen to on occasion ❎️ Tolerate while playing ❎️ Rather have no sound Pricing: ❎️ Worth more than the price ✅️ Well priced ❎️ Slightly overpriced ❎️ Should be half price ❎️ Should be free Story: ❎️ Super immersive and well told ✅️ Decently told and good story ❎️ Kind of boring ❎️ Hard to tell what's happening ❎️ No story Environments: ✅️ Insane, incredibly detailed ❎️ Realisitic and pretty detailed ❎️ Moderately well made ❎️ Almost nothing there ❎️ A white box would looks better Endings: ❎️ 0 ❎ 1 ❎️ 2 ✅ 3 ❎️ 4 ❎️ 5+ Final Rating: 9/10 This is undoubtedly my FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME! The whole post apocalyptic vibe is totally my style and this game Nails it! If I were to make the perfect game for myself, it would be this. I don’t know how the devs got this to be so good on the quest but wow. If you are still deciding to buy it stop scrolling right now and buy it!","So, as a VR FPS player, I went into this game expecting it to be a cake walk after playing a bunch of Onward and Contractors. Oh how wrong I was, this game is by far one of the best games I've had the ability to play. Not to mention the area design and atmosphere, but I'll get to that. First of all, I want to talk about the game itself (Beware, Spoilers!). I still haven't quite figured out the whole story but, from what I've gathered while playing, is you're an explorer who's been sent to replace a member of the same faction who's gone MIA. You have to do a bunch of side missions to get ""Priority Missions"". A ""Priority Mission"" is basically a high paying job that either furthers the progress of the story or gives you a higher security level, 1-5 each level you'll unlock new guns to buy. On the topic of guns, it's so nice and enjoyable to be able to just grab something and go straight into the radius without having to be focused on setting up anything. And the guns feel so nice, having to load the bullets one by one. The AI, is frightening to say the least, I expected this game to be some cool FPS game, but now after completing the game, it's definitely a horror game. In conclusion, this game has become one of my favourite games, and a must have for any VR FPS horror fan. With that being said, I'll see you in the radius, explorer!","Here is my feedback dumbed down to categories after hours of me playing the game!! (If you are thinking of buying any game, message me on oculus and I will give you a code for 25 percent off!! Also if you have any questions about the game I can help!! I respond QUICK!!)

Travelling the big open world as a survivor with a found or crafted materials fighting off shadow people and entities is so much fun. Also, this game has many times that it will catch you off guard when on of the shadow people run at you but you don’t see them coming till they scream right behind you. Also cleaning guns and keeping weapons up to shape is an awesome concept, GET THIS GAME!!! I Will get you the 25 percent off code I promise, I’m case you don’t believe me, I have no reason not to do it because it benefits me to get these codes out!! MESSAGE ME!!! Helpful?..🙏","Best game on VR no doubt. Kinda scary, REALLY fun, and very difficult. If you are thinking of getting this DO!!! My rating: Gun graphics: 10/10 Scary: 4/10 Enemies: 10/10 Natural beauty 11/10 (amazing) Fun: 9/10 Difficulty level: hard Overall: 9.5/10. Best vr game in history.👍","This game is hard, and I say this as a mildly experienced VR user playing on normal difficulty. In order to succeed I this game, you have to actually strategize and think. Shocker, right ? This is not a run & gun type of game, where you can do basically what you want. Just like dark souls, I am sweating while playing this game. Never have I felt more stressed out while playing a VR game. The environment is amazing- 9.5/10 Lots of details, scary as h*ll, looks actually Russian. The anomalies are annoying at best, deadly at worst, but they add a whole lot to the environment. My only complain about it is buildings. Can’t open doors or windows to create cover. It’s missing a SWAT aspect, where I could kick down a door to reveal a enemy hiding in the corner, or slowly opening one to go in methodically. Most buildings are smaller than they actually are, because some or most parts of it is locked behinds doors. It’s a shame, but it’s still amazing. Enemies are pretty good. 7/10 The enemies themselves are good, it is just that they are acting very weirdly. I have seen multiple times enemies zooming across the map, at ten times the speed they’re supposed to be going, or clipping through walls to shoot at me while I can’t shoot at them. The A.I is very good. You will get scared multiple times during your adventure by sneaky seekers, and get your skull crushed by those weird endermens. Just like I said, the enemies themselves are good, it it just that they’re acting weird on my part. Gun play is the best. Literally. 11/10 The best I’ve ever seen, comparable to Ghost of tabor or Horse shoes and Hand grenades, but with a twist. Every gun you have has durability. The lower it is, the higher the chance your gun jams. Different guns have different reliability, some are better than others, just like their real life counterparts. Every shot you take is important. Missing a shot feels really bad, and possibly will kill you, especially if you rock a bolt-action sniper rifle. Every shot counts, and costs you money or time. I am a decent marksman but I sill prefer taking it to the shooting range several times to practice it before taking it to a real mission. And you have to be careful ! If your gun goes down too much i durability, you can’t clean it yourself, you’ll have to repair it, for a price. Magazines are not to be thrown away, as they cost money. When you’re done with it and that you feel safe, you take your ammo box and your empty mag and you fill it up one bullet at a time. Bullet velocity is accurately represented, and you often have multiple variants of the same ammunition, which affects your gameplay. FMJ Standard round, nothing special. AP Amor piercing round, does less damage, but has a much higher chance to penetrate armor. Yes, enemies have armor. Good luck with that. SS Subsonic round. Less damage, less velocity and less armor penetration, but it is quieter, which reduces the radius in which the enemy hears you. Not worth it in my opinion. P+ More damage, but more expensive. I don’t know if it affects velocity. CHP Surplus round. Cheap but less effective in terms of damage and armor penetration. Not recommended. Don’t be cheap and buy some real sounds, for your sake, explorer #61. Anyways, the guns are more than amazing. They’re the best. There is so much to talk about here it’s crazy. Look at it in the radius wiki or videos, there is so much tech about this game it’s insane. Mechanics. Impressive-9/10 The backpack system is good, with the weight limit and all. Climbing is okay. You can only climb what the developer wants you to. Can’t grab a ledge to go a roof, can’t climb a cliff unless there’s handles placed there, which reduces immersion. Get me over that 5 inches ledge that’s apparently a solid wall. The rest/food system is good. You have to eat and sleep at some point. The gun cleaning is very satisfying to do, organizing your base is too. The knife play is a bit lackluster , but that’s alright. Can’t sneak up on some enemy and stab him, litterally never happened to me. Story/lore. Goes deeper than you think 9.5/10 *spoilers ahead* The voice acting is very good, the voice for Katya( I don’t know how to spell it but the white lady). The explorers logs and notes spread all over have lots of stories and details about the Radius. If you do find theses notes you’re will be less confused by the world around you. The ending is a bit on a cliffhanger (which makes me hope for into the radius 2) and does not really change anything afterward. No satisfying ending, only brings more confusion to me than anything. The 0,5 deduction is because I don’t know which ending is the canon one. Which one are we supposed to base our theories onto ? We lack answers that could’ve been provided by a little bit more clues. Also, I don’t know why they would close pechorsk castle after the end, brings less to explore afterwards. If I knew I would’ve taken everything but now there’s a stash I can’t access which is frustrating. Overall, Into the radius is an amazing game that deserves all the attention in the world. The developers are amazing people that truly care about about their work. This game is like the Dark souls of survival games because it is not meant for every gamer in my opinion. You have to go in there knowing that you will probably fail multiples times, while getting scared, especially if you play at 1am while your parents are sleeping, trying not to scream your lungs out. While it lacks in certain aspects, if this does not deserve 5 stars, what does ?"
