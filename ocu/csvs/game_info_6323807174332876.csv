Tea For God,"Tea For God is a VR adventure that uses impossible spaces with procedural generation to allow players infinite movement within their own room. Customizable gameplay can be anything between a relaxing long walk, an intense arcade shooter (checkpoint based) and a roguelite shooter-explorer. In the distant future, humankind has been united, ruled by God Emperor. Endowed with advanced technology we reached stars, colonised new worlds, went onto endless crusades against myriads of civilisations. Personal tragedies tend to be meaningless against the time. But once in a while, one person may start a fire that can change the fate of the whole universe. A man who lost his family, who holds God Emperor accountable for their death, seeking answers and vengeance, embarks onto his last journey to the place no human has ever left alive, where God Emperor is believed to reside.",7+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Hand Tracking","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Shooting","English, Catalan, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Czech, French (France), German, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Spain), Ukrainian",1.0.4,void room,void room,https://voidroom.com/,"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6323807174332876/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6323807174332876&r=1, https://voidroom.com/privacy-policy/",363.1 MB,"Many years ago, when it appeared as a small demo on itch.io, it was an interesting game, but it didn't offer much variety in terms of content. Now it has an incredible scope and the atmosphere and sci-fi setting is incredibly good. A great story and a lot of variety. The gameplay is additionally extraordinary and almost unique with the non-Euclidean geometry that lets you run endlessly without hitting your own walls. An absolute recommendation from me and also a great and very nice developer who has invested a lot of time in it over many years.","the game adapts to your space, but if you have 3x3 meters you play better, perhaps I suggest you move a table and play in 3x3 instead of not moving anything and playing in 2x2 meters. the sensation is really of great presence in the game, I also recommend reducing the guardian's sensitivity to a minimum so you don't see the borders as you get close, the game will prevent you from crashing into a wall because it builds the world around you so you never leave the playing area, in this way without ever seeing the guardian's grid you will really forget about reality, and I also recommend you try it with handtraking, although there are still some small details to fix, playing it like this makes even more sense diving, as well as shooting the robots it can be very satisfying to punch them, usually some robots even need just one punch in the right place to make them explode! this type of game represents a real revolution, and is really worth the cost of the ticket! and also there will be updates too!","There is NO possible way to give this game anything but 5 big golden stars. I have been hyped for the full game after playing the demo (which was better than other games I've paid for on my quest 2) for a long time, so you would think that with so much time the game could never live up to my expectations: but it still went above and beyond! The game is extremely well made and fun, and it's easy to get lost in the magnificent world that Void Room has carefully crafted, especially with the walking. Walking in real life to move in the game works very well in the impossible spaces, and increases the immersion of the game: finding the biggest place you can to make your boundary and play it is well worth. The mechanics of the game are in depth but aren't told directly to the player, so you end up running into them as you play the game. Almost nothing has a single sole use, and there's many ways to approach problems that you will figure out as you explore the vast world. The story unfolds around you as you keep moving forward through the impossible winding mazes, and I find it hard to leave the gripping world without making my way to the end. The game also has unmatched accessibility, so regardless of how comfortable you are with VR, or how good you are with games in general, there is still a great way for anyone to get the brilliant experience that is this game. I can easily recommend this game to anyone and everyone I know. Don't miss out on this experience!","The main draw here is the genius locomotion method where you can just... walk. You will be walking in circles in your own room, but it feels like you're exploring kilometres of bizzare sprawling complex with awesome sights to see. But I want to highlight the art direction especially. It makes the game very reminiscent of Another World (or Out of This World in the US), both in the visuals and some gameplay elements, where depending on the chosen gameplay mode you may be forced to make sense of an utterly alien world with its own rules and dangers. The sense of discovery is through the roof and I've never played a game that would reminded me so strongly of the 1991 gem. Highly recommended.","ðŸ“ŒTea for God 25 codeðŸ“Œ ðŸ‘‰ gigonvr,pl/s/TFG25 (use a dot instead of a comma) ðŸ¤œThis is a game that proves that graphics aren't everything. If you don't like it, you can always return it. However, it is a title that must be tried. Why? âœ… Amazing atmosphere - feel the atmosphere of s-f science books from the best authors of the genre. âœ… The variety of game style selection - everyone should find a form for themselves. There's even hand tracking. âœ… A unique graphic style that, despite its simplicity, hit my taste. This game is amazing. She stole my heart in every way. I RECOMMEND!"
