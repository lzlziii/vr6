Like every single fractal VR experience I've tried is behind a paywall. What's up with that? I think the video quality is good here, in any event.","If you've seen Trey Ratcliff's ""Machine Elf"" series of VR videos in the TRIPP app or on YouTube, this app contains something similar. To the best of my knowledge, Ratcliff pioneered these types of trippy videos--but to be honest, I kind of like these better. The biggest differentiator is the music--and I just like the music in these better. This app currently has 3 ""full"" videos (~10 minutes each) and 1 extra that you can purchase as DLC. I have no idea if the app will evolve into something more commercial, but the free content here is actually really decent. The DLC is ~$10 USD for an additional video. You can either stream or download the free content. The download size of each video is ~6gb so maybe try streaming first and grab it if you want it in higher-fidelity.","Love it. Unity video is my favorite. Though I am very sensitive to motion sickness, this video does not trigger it"
