Las Vegas,"Take the helicopter and fly over the shiny illuminated famous Strip with its hotels and attractions. Nice VR experience and beautiful memories if you already were there or if not, gain experience as if you are there. You get the impression to really be over Las Vegas. Take that crazy 360 degree real helicopter flight over Vegas by night without leaving your home, even without leaving your couch! You can look in all directions during the flight. Turn your head, look up and down outside of the helicopter. You have never seen this before. This is the ultimate VR Experience ... frameless. Flight time: 14 minutes. You fly an extraordinary route, directly over the Strip and over the hotel skyscrapers. The normal tourist sightseeing flight routes are always far from the Strip and cost many times more than that great app-flight experience. The normal tourist helicopter you can see on the horizon. If you have made such a tourist flight Las Vegas once, test the difference here.",3+,Single User,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", 360 Experience (non-game), Flying, Travel",English,1.0,press360,press360,https://3dtopevent.info/,"Sep 17, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4505393416172336/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4505393416172336&r=1, https://3dtopevent.info/oculus/user-data.html",1.01 GB,It was cool but spent a lot of time circling that first building over and over. Seeing Vegas at night from a helicopter was great but the darkness and all the neon made it a little hard to figure out what some of the locations were. Many things were blurred because of this It would also be great to see the same area during a sunny day. How about adding the ability to take the controllers and point at a location and have it show me the name.
