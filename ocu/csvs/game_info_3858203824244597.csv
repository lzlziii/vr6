It has a great impact to the vr community but yet there isn‚Äôt that much to do. Something‚Äôs I want to be added in this game is 1: 1v1 mode 2: accessories and cosmetics 3: 2v2 and other vs. But this game has lots of potential so you will never know what it has in store for us.,"Love the game, but I wish you could change your avatar and play with other random people, not just friends."
