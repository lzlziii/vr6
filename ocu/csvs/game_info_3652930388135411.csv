Alien TSA,"You are a lowly TSA officer on your first day in an alien airline. A new law just went into effect that allows anyone to fly if they can make it to a seat. YOU are the only thing between the airline and complete bankruptcy! Use your stun gun and computer terminal to identify the paying passengers and TASER the rest! You're also free to answer your cellphone, although you probably shouldn't. Try not to get fired or your parents will die of heartbreak.

The graphics are a specimen to lay your eyes upon especially in the VR 3D world. The gameplay however is on a whole other world with the incredible way of reloading which keeps the game exiting and keeps you on your feet. Also the way that each round has randomised clothes to look out for adds another layer of excitement for you donâ€™t know what happens next. Finally the incredible aspect of this game that you cannot write a review about if it is not included: the animations. They have obviously put so much hard work into these fun animations it is truly incredible. If you have not yet played the game then try it and you will see these glorious animations and you will understand what I mean. Thank you for your time and I hope you do try this game and I promise you that you will have a wonderful time and the fact that it is free means you might as well give it a go.,Fun level- 6/10 Introduction- 4/10 Overall-3/10 Could be more but a good start.,I broke reality please add a girlfriend boss fight she sounds pissed,In almost every way,This is a fun neat little game where you have to act as a TSA agent on an alien planet. Pretty simple idea but the difficulty lies in making the right ID in time. With some work this game could be a fun time killer or a quick game of VR tsa when time is limited. This is the kind of game you can just hop in and play without much effort or training. I wish the dev the best of luck in making this game amazing.
