I lost two sister's the last two years and this puzzle really helped me a whole lot. I sure hope you will make another one like it. I high recommend this peaceful puzzle to all. I found lots of comfort with it as well. Thank you so much.. please make another one.,"This game is a wonderful addition to 3D puzzling. The graphics of this imagined land and the movement of the little inhabitants as their land is rebuilt make this a game worth doing. And the fact this was created by a small indie studio makes it even more remarkable. I understand that it takes time to build more levels at the quality already established, but it is sad to reach and complete the final level. Would only wish that there are more levels to come. Worth waiting for.",I just finished all. It was much pleasant experience. My first hope is more contents. I can see two or three blank stones at the lobby maybe for the future update. The other one is upgrading for traveling option for the complted structures to find behind stories. Thanks for developers.,Some if these puzzles brought me to a state of complete awe! Beautiful.. takes a minute to understand the concept and the pieces float so look behind you if your missing a piece! Different levels..the little people racing around as you build their environment. . It's special!,"The Shore of Loci is a very relaxing concept. Greate graphicsJust a bit short, needs more content or a follow up , but I would still recommend it"
