An old-fashioned game of years ago turned into a VR game. I bought this the first day it was available. A week later I was still the only American on the leader boards. Only two people made it on the hard leaderboards and NO ONE has made it on the ""impossible"" leaderboards. You will LOVE testing your steadiness, skills, and patience. WHY IS THIS GAME NOT BEING SOLD IN THE OCULUS STORE?"
