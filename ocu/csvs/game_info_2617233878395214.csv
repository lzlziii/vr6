It‚Äôs usually multidisciplinary. One thing in common to all of these games is that they lack in realism. The Climb + The Climb 2 basically doubles down and says THIS IS THE ONLY EXPERIENCE! And they do a really really good job at it. This game is jaw dropping to first users of VR and it still inspires awe in me, even though I‚Äôm used to heights by now. Each level is true to its difficulty and your arms will get a workout for sure. You have to leave them in all sorts of angles until you can move forward again. It takes some getting used to, and I‚Äôm not sure how many calories you‚Äôre burning or muscle building you‚Äôre doing if at all (I work out most of the week doing swimming, body lifting and yoga) and I can tell you it gets difficult in hard mode. This sequel is on average, 1.5 or so hours longer than it‚Äôs predecessor and totaling at 6 plus hours. The graphics are as good as they can get (maybe not like Real VR Fishing or Brink Traveler) on the Quest, meaning realistic, intricate, but like all real-life depictions on the Quest, grainy!

However, I wish I had checked the Internet before buying. According to several comments, the servers for this game have been down for around 2 years which means some of the game is actually locked out. Since it has been so long, I can't see this being fixed anytime soon. For that reason, I cannot rate this 5 stars, despite the gameplay being a 5 star game ‚ú®Ô∏è","Love the game. darn shame there‚Äôs no splat from falling. climb around girders in the city, falling should result in multiple impacts with anatomically correct dismemberment from impacts from hitting everything the whole way down, ending in a third person visual of the splatter. ahh well, maybe next time. Seriously though. there should have been an endurance meter to make this more challenging. some sort of way to work in the player‚Äôs strength and stamina.","It bills itself as a free-climb game. So, I was expecting to be able to grab pretty much any edge/ledge/wedge I could, even angled surfaces and such the way real free climbers do. Instead, your path is outlined for you with clearly visible white-marked grips on mountains, or certain bricks sticking out of buildings, etc. If you see an angled surface, you can't grip it. You can't wedge your hands into cracks or crevices. It feels very artificial, and breaks the immersion. Because all I have to do is follow the very clearly marked path I'm railroaded along. Others reviewers say other games do poorly with climbing mechanics. Yet I was playing blade and sorcery nomad, and the tutortial level teaches you climbing. I was able to grasp angled surfaces, wedge my hand into crevices, etc, to climb along any path I wanted without it being prebuilt or outlined for me. So, I feel like The Climb series needs to step up its game / realism. Only other major complaint is you have to finish earlier levels on pro mode to unlock harder levels. I just want to play casual without having to worry about stamina, or chalk all the time. So, I wish they'd just let you start a full casual play through that has everything unlocled. Some of us are not hardcore gamers trying to prove our worth. With all that complaining said, it's still a, fun game. It's a puzzle game, though. Because you're trying to figure out which route to go, where to go, how, to position your hands to reorient yourself, etc. It's fun looking around, and it is immersive. The cliimbs are long. Easy levels are at least 15 mins,if youu start out. And your shoulders will feel it in the morning. I don't work up a, sweat in this the way I do with Gorn. This, is more of a ""hold your arms up for a long time"" game, that works your arms in a, different way for endurqnce. It's a good game, and I, hope, they come out with another. I just want a bit more of a real free climb experience, not ""we paintwd this climbing wall to look like a mountain"".","üíé25 % belowüíé https://bit ly/43YXBti Was this helpful then press the button at the bottom of the page The Climb 2 is a breathtaking and exhilarating virtual reality game that takes rock climbing to new heights.
