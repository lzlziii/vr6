Copy and paste or type the link above into the internet address bar, and accept before purchasing. Then you can instantly get 25％ off in the official Quest Store. Contractors is one of the most realistic first person shooters on the meta quest market. The gameplay mixed with the mods is the closest we have to a Halo, Star Wars, Call of Duty, and Team Fortress 2 VR (etc). The only flaw I have is that I don’t like how the flash bang turns your screen black instead of white, and how you have to press trigger while pumping the shotgun (but those would be dumb reasons to change my rating). Overall this game surprised me with the realism and how the graphics were amazing, I recommend this to anyone that enjoys classic first person shooter games or just normal shooter games! If you played Pavlov Shack this game is a big upgrade from Pavlov and I would recommend it. This is one of the best shooter games I own and I heavily recommend it that you give this game a try! There are still some bugs, (ex: kicking you out of the game, random lag, etc.) but it still performs amazing. Don’t let this chance down and try it today!😻😻 💎💎",➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪🟪🟪 ➖🟪⬛⬛🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪🟪🟪 ➖🟪⬛⬛🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪🟪🟪 ➖🟪⬛⬛🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ⬜⬛🟪⬜⬛🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪⬛⬛⬛⬛🟪🟪🟪 ➖🟪⬛⬛🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪🟪🟪🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 ➖➖➖➖🟪➖➖🟪 That's what I think,"Contractors is one of the most realistic first person shooters on the meta quest market.
