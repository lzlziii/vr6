Budget Cuts Ultimate,"As your last human co-worker is hauled away, a mysterious briefcase from someone on the outside is delivered to your desk. You need to get to the bottom of what is going on at TransCorp. Sneak around enemy robots by climbing through air ducts and service tunnels, or embrace violence by unleashing a fistful of knives, quivers of arrows, grenades, and coffee mugs onto their unsuspecting circuits. Once you‚Äôve completed your mission, test your skills in the arcade with multiple modes, difficulty levels, and scoring.",12+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action",English,3329,Neat Corporation,Neat Corporation,http://neatcorporation.com/,"Jun 1, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3011203712298006/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3011203712298006&r=1, https://neatcorporation.com/privacypolicy/index.html",Terms of Service,4.06 GB,"Ok first of, I want to call out reviews saying it looks old and dated. It graphics are simple yes, but that reflects the story. It‚Äôs no horizon call of the mountain, heck it‚Äôs running on quest that good on its own. Next, let‚Äôs talk gameplay. It‚Äôs some of the best VR has to give. The stealth is rewarding, as well as the combat. Every level can be done as you please, in the first one at least. There is an auto crouch feature, but mainly you will do it your self, and it‚Äôs really quite immersive to peek your head above the cubicles and see enemies around you. The teleportation feature is a very intuitive feature, which makes teleportation fun, rather than just a movement mode. Spoilers for story from her on out! The game dose a great job of hyping up the villain. Pictures of a old man with a thick country accent everywhere with announcements coming from the speakers. The whole time he‚Äôs played up to be a bad guy, with mentions of someone spanned Adam. Before I explain this next part, you should know I‚Äôm not easy to scare in vr. When I waltzed calmly into the studio in the final map i had no idea what was behind me. ‚ÄúYour meeting with hr is ready!‚Äù Chills went down my spine. I was frozen as Adam stomped ready to idk eat my soul. It‚Äôs such a good boss fight and a terrifying villain. Buy budget cuts ultimate, I should mention it costs the same as one of the games on steam, so it‚Äôs two for one basically. Bugs: Npc dialogue triggered when I‚Äôm above them The piggy bank disappearing from the rehabilitation center, doesn‚Äôt appear on reset, had to start a new save. Requests: The ability to bring the portal to your face rather than clicking a button, because I heard that you could do this to be more silent but it‚Äôs still fine Regenerating tacos, that‚Äôs a real request in the rooftop level in 2 I ate all tacos and couldn‚Äôt put one through the slot Also if anybody knows how to get the screwdriver in the main lobby tell me, I found a vent with screws, but I need to unscrew them.","This game to simply put it is a masterpiece of vr story telling and world building with the stealth and combat mechanics keeping you always on your toes. Your first play through is not your last, the game entices you to keep playing with collectibles and achievements galore. I LOVE this game and would recommend it to anyone interested in an enthralling Vr story.","I‚Äôm going to make this review short, if you like games with great stealth mechanics and throwing ‚ÄúEnvelope Openers‚Äù then this is the game for you! Overall this game has great story and gameplay with really tiny glitches, but you‚Äôre going to expect this from a new game so it will get updated soon. Another thing is that the game is very time consuming and has great puzzles you can solve in the future. If you like these types of games then go for it burn a couple bucks and enjoy the several hours of puzzle solving.",Taco but if you love taco taco taco taco taco if you love taco salad buy the game if you love taco pizza but the game who am I kidding if you love robot tacos buy the game also the price is good for a taco robot slicing game and tack eating game mostly taco eating and robot slicing too not bad game BUY NOW,I‚Äôm not kidding this is a good game but it‚Äôs still has those flaws when it just makes you want to rage but overall it‚Äôs a good gameüëç I would recommend it if you‚Äôre a fan of stealth games this is a game for you
