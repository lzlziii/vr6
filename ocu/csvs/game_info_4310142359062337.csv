Finally, a Kaiju game for VR which you can be the monster. It’s one of the most fun I ever had. I highly recommend it.",As soon as I seen that I could play as a giant monster and destroy a city like Godzilla I had to buy it and it was exactly what the 6 year old in me would’ve wanted plus more and it has tons of replayability I’m not even that far in and I love this game so much.,"Im not saying the game is bad with the latest QOL update, but i feel a little discomfort with the eating animation, i wish there was a way to get a simpler design (I mean with the mouth animation) And yes Happy Kampers, i have not played in a while (due to the discomfort with the eating animation). I still wish you a happy development. By the way, you should check this review a little more often rather than just the one time, i don’t like having to delete the review and do it over again. By the way, you guys do a really good job with the game. You listen to everyone that plays, make adjustments from that information. You guys are really good.. just.. don’t you dare abandon anyone’s previous ideas. At least not without telling them (including me and everyone working for this very game, or any game that you make). Btw i did the math and 15%(now 13%)of the reviews are 3 stars or less, doing great! Edit: is it just for me, or is the dev post for difficulty not showing? Edit 2: if you need any ideas, maybe (and that is a huge maybe) ask me? I’ll be thinking a idea or 2 when you ask. As always, have a happy development, happy kampers. By the way, if you are adding a new monster, don’t forget to change the description of the game. By the way, (i know its a long edit but) why are people not leave now reviews? That seems odd to me, only like 1 or 2 reviews in the past week. Note: Redone above precisely for attention Edit 3: is it just me or is time moving slower than a 5 day week of school? Btw i cant play the game because someone is staying over and borrowing my room and my meta is in my room and they got covid so they need to stay there so… And in the trailer i noticed that you were using a human avatar, how you do that bro? Edit 4: I think some people may want to know on a estimate when the update will come out (by days if possible, if you cant, weeks) and i like the devs. They are by a mile the greatest devs i have ever come across (at least in the reviews) and no two interactions are the same, and they don’t copy and paste the same thing (with the only exception being the social links). Also while in your room i could not swap the levels after changing movement controls. This time I truly mean it. Happy development Happy Kampers. Edit: i did change the movement controls to smooth and i forget if i used both but i know i used my right hand, ill try tomorrow at the time of writing this Edit 2: i forgot and at the time of writing this my oculus died. Also i suggest make bug fixes and stuff monthly or so to keep the game updated and not lose popularity. Sorry if I miss understood the sheer time it takes, i never really tryed to develop a game myself (because i play games, not make them). Edit 3: I keep on forgetting to try the game but maybe its because update-less? Idk, im not a game doctor."
