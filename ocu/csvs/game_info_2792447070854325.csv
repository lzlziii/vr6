It is the best of its kind, a zombie arcade style shoot em up. Fast, accurate, fun , plenty to do, not glitchy at all and tal can be funny sometimes. If you like arcade zombie shooters then this the one..","This game is actually pretty good at being an on-rails shooter that takes quite a bit of skill to master and is very addictive. I loved it and like most games like this, you will always come back to it to test your skill. Contains the same humor as the movies with the characters you know and love. Would recommend to anyone new to VR or wants something a bit more casual but challenging.",It‚Äôs a great arcade shooter with good humor. But it‚Äôs a little short and needs more levels. All characters should have 3 levels and not have the last two characters with only 2 or 1. Woodys was disappointing he should have 3 levels and have the invitational be separate from the characters. Good on the Devs Game needs 2player coop !!!!!!,"Love this game. It's one of the most fun games I've played in VR and super addictive. Just ""one more run"" turns into 4 hours later trying to beat my high score and landing 5-10 headshots in a row is so darn satisfying when you nail it.",FOR SURE a 5/5 I love the game and the movie zombie land is one of my favorite zombie movies and when they came out with the game holy hell I wanted it badly but I don't have enough so I tried out the trial and it Is so good I wish I had enough tho awesome game üëç
