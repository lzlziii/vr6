Starting off with the good, it's very reminiscent of RE1 while still keeping some originality. The atmosphere is good, though the maps could do with some better direction. The zombies are fun to shoot, and you can even pop heads! Good classic zombie killing fun. There's another type of enemy too, but I won't spoil it. I thought it was an interesting choice. What really hinders this game is the inventory. The inventory system is the buggiest I have ever seen. You're constantly grabbing the wrong item, dropping items and not being able to find them, or worse case scenario an item just disappears entirely. You really need to figure out the exact inputs to make in order to get a chance at inventory management. I ended up having to glitch through some walls because I lost a key item and couldn't find it. The camera also sucks too, it's not properly scaled 1:1 to the height of your headset so it can be disorientating especially if you're bending or leaning. If it wasn't for the buggy inventory and camera, I'd give this game 3 stars. Overall, if you're a Resident Evil fan, can manage some pretty nasty jank, and have already tried the better alternatives, then pick this game up. I'll check out the sequel to see if it's any better. Edit: I've figured out the inventory. You need to open it, and slowly select what you want to interact with. Once you do, press trigger. Weapons will be equipped to your hand while ammo and health will be used immediately (for reloads or heals.) Don't do what I did and try to grab the items. Hope this helps anyone.",It's so scary remains me of affected manor game its so scarry I like zombies üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in it great job with this game
