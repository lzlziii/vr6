As of writing this it’s still in early access 2.0 but from what’s available it’s very good, the fighting is great I enjoy the fact that bullet time isn’t manually triggered and has a requirement that isn’t just a timer, I think punching is fairly satisfying but it could get touched up slightly, and dodging in real life as opposed to having a dodge button is also very cool. The hacking is fairly intuitive as well and it’s pretty fun honestly sort of like unlocking a safe, now onto other matters. The story is presented in a very unique way for a VR game in the visual form of comic style panels that aside from the text are also voiced over, aside from that you’ll get dialogue and exposition as you play through the game in key sequences and even some optional encounter dialogue stuff which surprised me as I wasn’t expecting an optional encounters. As far as I’m aware from some videos and Twitter posts AI was used but as opposed to the sometimes popular belief that it’s a negative I think it actually enhances the experience and allows the devs to put more time into other things. The areas you go to and the sights you see are also spectacular even for a quest game. There’s also some lore and more to come and it’s honestly impressive what the devs were able to whip up here. This game radiates a lot of passion and dedication if I have to say it. It’s a bit janky at times but it’s more fun and engaging than it is buggy. If this game continues to be worked on which it will and is still being worked on. It has a possibility to be a best seller in my opinion and I’m very excited for future updates and the full release at which point I will be updating my review",Had a lot of fun playing this and glad I came across the demo via App Lab. Im a big fan of sci fi and martial arts action movies and playing this game was just like being in one! I don’t usually like punching games but the combat here feels very satisfying. I do think that pressing both grip and trigger buttons to make a fist would feel more ‘natural’ but just using the grip button is fine so not a deal-breaker. Congrats to the devs for such great work. Look forward to seeing further updates in the future.,This game is AWESOME! I just started playing and it is a blast and totally immersive! 360 combat is wild! I have to remind myself that kicking does not track :) I really enjoy the storyline so far and can see that the developers have put a lot of time and thought into the game. Crazy the quality for such a small studio. I'm glad I picked this up in early access and look forward to future updates!,Good futurist vibes. You can tell alot of effort put into the story itself. I know it is still being worked on so looking forward to how it evolves.,"Won this in a giveaway and I’m loving it so far! The combat is great and it’s really immersive. One of my favorite quest games, it feels really polished and clean"
