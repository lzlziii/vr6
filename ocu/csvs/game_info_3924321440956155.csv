Running Bros,"A fun platformer where you ""run in place"" to move forward and ""jump in place"" to jump. Gather coins and beat levels while running where you stand. Use your body to run, jump and navigate obstacles in a cartoony adventure. It is both fun and a great exercise.

The execution is mixed at best. The graphics are what can be expected from an AppLab quest title. They are decent nothing special, not bad. The game play mechanics are the same as it‚Äôs source inspiration except it‚Äôs in VR so you are the character so you have to do the actions; run, jump, stomp on enemies. That‚Äôs all well and fine but this is where my biggest complaint comes in. The movement controls are just not good. Jumping isn‚Äôt difficult but jumping at the right time is difficult because sometimes just running in place the game thinks I jumped so timing jumps is a real trick. I would love to have a stick and jump button option for locomotion. Stick and button controls would raise the score by at least 2 stars as this game has great potential to be a SideQuest hit! PS I would also ask the developer keep in mind many of us original SMB players are old people now and can‚Äôt jump well. üòâüëçü§ô"
