VekWars,"Sometime in the mid-1980s development began on a technology that, had it gone to market, would have changed video gaming as we know it. A complete virtual-reality system meant for arcades, utilizing twin head-mounted vector monitors of the type used in many classic games of the time. Sadly, funding for the project dried up before it reached completion, and the first game for the system - VekWars - never saw the light of day, continuing to exist only in rumor and a handful of blurry photographs from the period. But now a team of digital archaeologists based in Austin, Texas have successfully extracted the source code for this game from a dusty 8-inch floppy disk provided by an anonymous benefactor. We are pleased to present VekWars - fully updated to support modern virtual-reality systems (or non-VR monitors) and playable for the first time in over 35 years!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Arcade, Shooter",English,0.10,Washing-Up Software Projects,Washing-Up Software Projects,http://washingupsoftwareprojects.com/#/vekwars,"Jul 30, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3955718291162167/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3955718291162167&r=1, https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/live/b42fed67-d13b-408e-8d07-0373d591f257",274.8 MB,"It's basically the 80s gaming experience in VR. The ship models, sounds, shooting mechanics, everything works really well together and reminds me of my ZX Spectrum from back in the day. It's a really fun game so far and already longer than I expected, hoping you guys can bring more titles in this style!","This game takes you back to the glory days of late 1970’s early 1980’s arcade games when Vector Graphics were become more widely used. Games like asteroids, battle zone, tempest, and the first Star Wars arcade game were Vector Graphic Classics. This game uses those exact same types of graphics while playing like a mix of all the games mentioned. If you loved them then or are interested I. Seeing what the buzz was about this is a great VR example of that. Defenders wanted."
