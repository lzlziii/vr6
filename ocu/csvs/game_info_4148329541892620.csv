Cornhole Kings,Begin your legend now and become a cornhole king. Travel through time to the ruins of an ancient world to the palace of the king. Compete in global challenges and even face the mighty cannon on the shores of a deserted island. Prove your worth or remain a mere peasant on the stage of history. Configure throw options and board distances and relax to the sounds of nature as you throw the bag of beans. Life has never been so good. ,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Simulation, Sports",English,6,JeffJinks,Milkyway Publishing,https://www.cornholekingsvr.com/,"Feb 11, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4148329541892620/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4148329541892620&r=1, https://www.milkyway-publishing.com/cornhole-kings-privacy-policy",317.3 MB,"I unlocked the game and didn't observe a way to START playing! I read tips and guidance, but the game never provided an option to PLAY. Please advise. Princess","I always look for social games. I've had this a few months and have played solo a few times. It's ok. The throwing motion seems a little awkward still but I'm getting better. I've not yet had any friends buy the game so we could try multiplayer. That will be the real test for me, how smooth the process of joining is and the competitiveness and sociability of the multiplayer game.",Very glad the developer has created a game based on cornhole. With the latest update the throwing motion is much more realistic and the game is a lot more fun.
