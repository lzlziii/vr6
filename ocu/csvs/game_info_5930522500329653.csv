We've been up working non stop since yesterday afternoon trying to make this happen, but we are people and people need sleep. Thank you to everyone who's supported us throughout all these setbacks. I'd rather launch something that we can be proud of and be able to interact with the community when it comes out, then to rush it out and drop dead asleep. I know a lot of people are disappointed and I completely understand, I'm sorry for letting you down today. We'll continue to do everything we can tomorrow. Goodnight gang” Now that trout posted the release date and time has been revealed that means that the servers might fill up and maybe crash the game since they’ve hyped and milked the game too much to the point everyone is excited to get on their vr headsets to play the game.",When this game was announced he said it like it would be more than this a great game but he didn’t give it the best he could. I mean he has made some great horror gorilla games but didn’t release them and they should have been included in the grand opening of kong. Overall it is an alright game but it is just missing something 🤷,Please fix this I can’t even play the game I can’t get into any lobbies at all
