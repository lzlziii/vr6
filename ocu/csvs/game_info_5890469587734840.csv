This is only for female character. We need man too. * Ability to customize your character and see yourself in multiple mirrors. * be able to save and delete your creations, and compare them * Be able to take pictures and email to yourself or somewhere. * Ability to actually order the clothes designed. I would focus either on casual/dating clothes, business related clothes, swimming suits, or wedding clothes.","We do VR night once a week and I threw this one on for the kids and our youngest girl couldn't put it down. Haven't tried it for myself but she said it's a 5 star. PS to creators, your page listing on here and app lab says Stying and the logo has it spelt correctly ""Styling"""
