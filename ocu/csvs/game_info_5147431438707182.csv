Monkey Climbers,"This is a gorilla tag locomotion game where you walk with your hands and be a monkey!! There is a forest, you can do parkour, change your monkey fur with color changing, there is name changing cosmetics, and even a waterfall with a water slide!! Come join us on this monkey adventure and also, watch out for that pink bubble thing. It's very dangerous!!",3+,Multiplayer,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Adventure, Casual",English,0.27,Wspitsaaron,baba,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ8HmKMEXPkzwMd2v32PHmA,"Aug 5, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5147431438707182/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5147431438707182&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZW8DHuEX0uKHZpKr9MsdhdcaVvgofxVd5IwDmZe-io/edit?usp=sharing",262.2 MB,(Devs). Please add a mod menu it would be fun that’s all bye,It was actually a good game but sadly got hacked and there is no more updates,"The game used to be good. There was plenty of trees in the forest\jungle,the city was good, nothing too excessive and there was a mountain map that didn't have anything but a mountain and snow and it was pretty good for just talking to friends. But now it's just bad. The mod menu: gone before any mods. Platforms: gone. Now you just hold A and flap your arms (very not fun for my arms).","Ok this is just me ranting about the current update. 1: the high bridge is bugged, when you walk on it you get stuck. 2: the ice thing that leads to Desert looks like it’s from capuchin. 3: there are tunnels that just lead to the outside of the map so people can get out easily. 4: this game has 0 ORIGINALITY.￼ I dare you to change my mind about this game.",I don’t got much to say but it’s a pretty good game overall I really like it with the mod menu and platforms and stuff but the new owner is kind of toxic at least I think either I met him or met a guy that says he’s the owner but he’s not Love the mod menu but you got to add mods
