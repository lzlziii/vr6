Echo VR,"After almost six years of zero-G competitive action, Ready At Dawn will cease operations of Echo VR on August 1st, 2023 - 10:00 AM Pacific. The time has come for the studio to focus on new projects, which we look forward to sharing in the future. It has been our pleasure to see this community grow, compete, and bring so much passion to the game over the years. Thank you.

The game wasn‚Äôt realistic or had the best player base but I loved it and I‚Äôve faced lots of homophobia and bullying but also I have met good people and have had amazing matches. Goodbye forever echo hopefully either echo vr 2 or lone echo 3 (or whatever project you have coming up) I hope it will like up to the ready at dawn standard. Goodbye :) (:","Hey META... bro. ECHO VR is the best VR sports game on the planet. Have you somehow completely missed the signal from your customers on how loved this game is? Do you even read these messages? This zero gravity ‚ÄúTRON meets Endor‚Äôs game‚Äù is an experience that can only be created in VR. Please don‚Äôt bury it! Rebuild it ! It has so much potential and is unlike anything else in VR ! To my fellow echo VR friends, it has been amazing fun playing this game with you all. I am so sad to see it end. I have to admit I am still pretty bitter about this turn of events but look forward (and hopeful) to what the future will bring. Long live echo!

This was my favourite VR- no favourite videogame of all time. I had so many good memories, got so many good friends, so many good moments and plays. This truly is a legendary game in the history of meta. Also deleting the game is a big mistake from meta's end, there would have been so many better ways to do it. Well then, gotta make the most outta these last moments, love you echo players. The game will never be forgotten, it's stuck in our hearts, goodbye echo...","I simply loved everything about Echo. Whether it be engaging in an anti-gravity sport, or wanting to connect with other players. Echo VR is by far my favorite VR game ever. I find it very confusing on the reason why they need to shut it down‚Ä¶ But alas, if there is no more hope left for Echo to be reconsidered by Meta, then I just want to thank the developers who took the time and effort into making this game. You may not know it, but Echo VR brought a lot of people together, even if it‚Äôs all through the eyes of a digital reality. Many good memories. Some annoying, some competitive, but overall a great experience. You really felt like what it was to be a part of a team sport and be competitive. So all I can say at this point, 7 days before the game is removed, is a goodbye and thank you."
