Looking forward to further updates which make it better!","The game is great for what it is, and that is all you can ask of a game! It’s simple, yet it’s pretty fun. The leaderboard things that pop up when a round ends are a little laggy, as when I shot the arrows the board didn’t change. But overall this was great, I’d give it a 4.5 out of 5.","guns feel very smooth and accurate, little to no lag, and there were like no bugs at all. i got this game for free but it is definitely worth the money",I got this game for free and it’s amazing,"I find it really fun to train my reaction time and aim with this game. There's a few different modes that I find pretty fun to play and while there's still room for more additions, this game is already very fun."
