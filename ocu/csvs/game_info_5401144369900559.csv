Simple yet, not boring. A few suggestions: 1) A few more locations to play in. 2) More choices of music. Love Boogie-Woogie, but it was not around in the old west. Maybe an old west-style song 3) More selection of A.I. players instead of just the two. 4) The ability to play against friends and family around the world. 5) There are times the game FORCES you to move a particular piece, one that I did not want to move, and was leaving it as a diversion because I have better & bigger plans. 6) Levels: Easy, normal, hard, expert, etc... 7) Have the A.I. get better as you get better. 8) Different colors for the checkers. (red, blue, pink, yellow, etc...) This game has great potential!",Where is the online mode to be able to play with freinds? Indicates that you can do this but no option?,I wish more developers would create board games for the Quest. This one is enjoyable.,"It is a bare bones checkers vr game. There is no special boards, game modes, etc. There is not even a way to pick up pieces. You must drag and drop. But if you want a pure checkers vr game, well this is the one since there is not any competition.
