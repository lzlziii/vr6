Pong,Classic paddle game reimagined for VR Destroy all the bricks. Use your paddles to swing at the balls and the balls have built-in assistance to return back toward you. Take advantage of the pistol and magneto power-ups to cause major damage. Or just swing hard at the balls to create large blast radius. Oh and watch out for those mines going for your head. Lean left/right or crouch to avoid.,3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Arcade, Sports",English,"1.0.1

Love it.,"This seems to be one of those games that started out great, but the developer tired of it and moved on. I like it, but the lack of options is disappointing. You have no choices in the game, meaning if you just want to zone out with a paddle and break bricks, you can't. You have to deal with other things like a gun and magnet. All the levels are timed and you can't turn that off either and just slam away like you can in RacketNx. Other reviewers mentioned that it needs updates and it does, but I doubt that will happen so if you buy the game you have to take it as it comes.",A smashing experience. Playable seated if you prefer to play that way rather than standing. Looks very crisp and clean in the headset. Lots of levels to test your pong reflexes. Well worth the asking price and one of my go-to apps since downloading it.,Game looks and feels nice. Very gratifying to hit the ball and watch it break boxes. well worth the cost. Give it a try. A refund is always an option. Can play sitting or standing. You don’t have to go chasing the ball because it always ends up coming within arms reach on its return. Nice 80s retro look One of the games id use to show off VR to someone new. The music is meh; sounds like medieval folk music. Ball physics need some work; you can get the ball going in the right direction but it’s hard to put it exactly where you want. there is too much up/down randomness. 05/21/2022 30 minutes playtime,"This is the paddle game I've been looking for on VR. Basically VR arkanoid meets racketball with some twists. Really fun and challenging at the same time. And I love games with this neon graphics style. I've updated my review from 4 stars to 3 because the more you play the more you realize what's lacking. It really needs some updates. More polished graphics, more realistic ball physics, more levels and modes, some improvement to the power ups. And it really needs better music (or allow custom music), because the music doesn't match the game at all. Thanks to the devs for this game. With some updates and more polish I think this would be a must have game on VR."
