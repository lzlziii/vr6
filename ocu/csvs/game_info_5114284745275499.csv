VizworX Demo Pack,"A collection of several of our recent Virtual Operations Environment demonstration projects, available in English and Brazilian Portuguese. The Illegal Fishing Environment highlights controls for presenting vessel information in a 3D view allowing new ways of quickly highlighting temporal data. The satellite globe helps users to start to understand the satellite paths and get a feel for the distances involved with satellite trajectories. The utility environment highlights Brazil's electrical system. The Virtual Security Operations Environment allows security staff to quickly get an interactive overview of issues on the entire property.
