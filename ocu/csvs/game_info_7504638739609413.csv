Eventually found a solution posted on reddit. Also found several other people complaining, all stuck on the same first puzzle, so I'm not alone. After reading the solution, I tried the Materializer and the first jump scare almost made me spill my coffee. Yeah, that's it for me. Uninstalled it.","""""Edit at the bottom in response to dev reply."""" No, seriously, don't do it. It's is no way worth that much money. I got the game for free during a free week. The game is 3(correction, technically 4 rooms) rooms, at roughly 15-30 mins of play time total. The ""puzzles"" amounted to not much, and the jump scares were boring and expected. The mechanics are rough, and desperately need refinement. This feels like an alpha test at best. There needs to be massive improvements before this would be worth $5 much less $15. My apologies to the dev for being harsh, but it legitimately feels like you're trying to rip people off here. If I had paid, I'd be requesting my money back. You have the framework for a good scary puzzle game if you put in A LOT of work. But it is not at all that right now. Edit: Since the dev made a point to tell me I must have missed something in the game. I went back, and played through it 5 times. Each time clearing the entry room(room 2, puzzle 1), the room with 4 statues(room 3, puzzle 2), and the engine room(room 4, puzzle 3). These are the three ""puzzle rooms"". Each playthrough was exactly the same. With no changes to anything present in either room. After clearing the engine room each time, the game ""ends"" and you're placed back in the main menu area. Selecting ""continue"" only places you back at the end, and selecting ""new journey"" starts the game over. No additional menus or options are added after completing a run. In each rerun I thoroughly explored each area looking for some way to change the overall outcome. There was nothing. Additionally I found out its possible to get stuck in the second and third room by misplacing key non replaceable items. Forcing you to restart the room entirely. The visual effects in the windows and aquarium move with your headset, and you can move your head through walls and doors. I've lowered my star rating to a 1 because I had to do all of that to find nothing different. Additional note to the dev. If I genuinely missed something that changes the outcome. It is not apparent through heavy exploration, much less normal gameplay.","The Retrieval is a space sci-fi, horror puzzle game, that screams 80s sci-fi movie vibes. A government spaceship used for secret experiments goes missing for 200 years, then just reappears one day. The ship is not moving and silent to all our attempts to communicate. Our job is simple, just board the ship and report back what's going on. Simple? This is the setup to a horror flick, not some routine check up. The game has you exploring a ship deep in space alone. Once you get through the loading bay, you realize this ship has a dark past. You will immersed into a space sci-fi world, where you will have to use your skills to solve puzzles and move onward through the ship. A creep horror movie type ship that is. The puzzles are challenging, but the answers are there if you spend time to look for them. The creep sounds and atmosphere will keep you on your toes, with some good scares at just the right times. I have been watching horror movies and playing scary games since the 80s, and this game still got me on a few times. This is a great VR experience if you are into space sci-fi, horror and puzzle solving. Like a good movie, I was left with questions, surprises, and the want for more. This is one VR story you don't want to pass by. Watch my preview here; https://youtu.be/6W5gGtwhdCQ",I got scared good a few times! Some of the puzzles took a while for me to get but the solutions are there if you look hard enough :) Must buy for scifi lover who loves puzzles & horror.,"I'm a huge fan of the movie Prometheus , my favorite space movie . This game looks and plays fantastic with a super creepy vibe, I've just started......more to come. Well game was seriously short I mean for $15 bucks I was expecting more content . Kinda disappointing with 30 mins of gameplay, that's a hefty price for so little hope u add a much longer chapter soon . Feel cheated a bit"
