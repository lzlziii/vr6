It took me 2 hours to complete, and for 5 bucks I would say it's one of the best bang for your buck titles in the AppLab catalog. I'm looking forward to the next titles of this developer!","When I got the game it didn’t look as fun but it was pretty much one of the funnest games I’ve ever played who are games is very scary you should make it like checkpoints well not checkpoints like like you have three days like granny kind of but it’s like I wanna really hard games but like it’s still really fun but you need to update I’m serious I really need update again update would be like I would want like the update to be you can pause the game I don’t know if you can do that the update needs to haveThree daysUntil you die siren head like there’s a bed in the room and you need to escape from the banker, and the final thing you need to add is another siren head over or do you need to add something that makes it kind of easy because the game is very hard right now like I would like it to be normal and I put her in￼￼ put hiding spots around the map","This is a really good game, it’s tough, will definitely make you jump and well worth the £3.99 price. Basically your stuck in a bunker and you need to complete tasks to escape, only problem is there’s a siren head patrolling the place. If he sees you it’s game over. My only gripe is sometimes when moving around in corridors it’s almost like there’s the odd invisibility wall so it’s tricky to move. Still very enjoyable and scary though. Check out my video for some gameplay and screams. YouTube channel is Fun with the clicks",I really enjoyed the game!,I used to watch siren head and now this?
