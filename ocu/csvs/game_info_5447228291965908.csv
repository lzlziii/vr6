But be careful not to get caught yourself! ;),3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Arcade, Sports",English,0.1.6,DreamTeam Mobile,DreamTeam Mobile,https://www.dreamteam-mobile.com/,"Jul 15, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5447228291965908/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5447228291965908&r=1, https://drmtm.blob.core.windows.net/policies/skader/Skader-PrivacyPolicy.pdf",119.4 MB,Great like tron nut find the first skader game I.m a speed skater and also aggressive half pipe Never tinking I cool feel this with the quest 2 without feet tracking But if I swing my hips like in speed skating I go fast and super high almost over the ramp wall I have sometime a pain In the hips after long speed skater and with skader the same so this will be a good indoor exercise for me moving better I just saw a YouTube with more please how to contact you It should be great to have a SF Tron skatepark indoor or VR room And later a speed skater piste to ?,"I don’t wanna be that guy and I’m not trying to be I don’t wanna poop all over your project I like the idea because I love Tron I can’t believe no one has made a light cycle game yet it’s driving me crazy. And when I saw your app that’s what I thought— Blades of glory meets Tron￼, But the controls are bat crap crazy and uncomefortable, not intuitive￼. It is a headache to get yourself in motion in the first place, literally. and once you’re in motion it is incredibly hard to steer because there really isn’t any indicator as to how to steer effectively. the only tip that comes in handy in the tutorial is lifting your hands up, What was what I felt like I was doing the whole time but without direction￼￼. the head motion was unclear as well and again, kind of a￼￼ literal headache. it has potential. I’m not a fan of Voxel graphics but I like the idea -if it could somehow incorporate human pvp in the future. I don’t have a solution to the controls but I’m telling you, that game will not takeoff with the controls as is￼￼. And while it’s not a complaint of mine but game is a shallow. I mean ,with limited AI people probably will get bored with it after a weekend. But great effort and good idea. I only give it a 2 So that if you figure it out… you’ll know you earned your stars. ￼￼￼","First, thank you developers of the game, I liked it. More please. It takes time to learn and get use to the control and movement. But it is not hard and good fun feeling of body workout. Please continue to improve new gameplay , free style endless skate, more maps please outdoor open air if possible. Thank you","This game is fantastic even in this very early stage! HUGE Tron fan and Skader truly does this franchise a justice. My only input for later development is the addition of discs in hands, even if they are only cosmetic. If possible those disc can be thrown at players inflicting damage similar to the movie. However these are just suggestions but would be a nice addition. Skader is the only game I have found to truly do Tron a justice!"
