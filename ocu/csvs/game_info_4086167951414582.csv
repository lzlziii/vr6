I ended up buying it when it was on sale. It was a very good decision. A wonderful and exciting Spider-Man style game in a truly stunning environment, with huge spaces, heights, depths, full of excitement and fear at the same time. Simple graphics don't matter. You can spend a lot of time in it to explore and get everything. Some stone tablets are really challenging to get. If you buy it, you won't regret it. If you suffer from motion sickness, there is a ""cage"" in the settings that can help you overcome or neutralize it.","Boy do I love this game! I played the campaign and beat it in a few short hours and it felt satisfying. I thought I was done with it because I don‚Äôt really go for collectibles. But soon I became utterly obsessed with getting them all. It‚Äôs immensely challenging and I‚Äôve read posts about people spending 60+ hours and not getting all the tablets. There is hardly any help online and even with the few videos and photos, making sense of the locations is very difficult. So after 15 hours of a lot of work I‚Äôve completed the game and collected all the tablets. It was incredibly rewarding and meditative and at times maddening. This is a game of which you swing around trees and bushes to arrive at the locations of your goal. Each world (3 of them) has a different landscape and this peaceful feeling that you‚Äôre the only person alive. Again, meditative. The music certainly helps. This is a simple game. Simple graphics, minimal score (excellent score), minimal goals. It‚Äôs brilliant for winding down. Though it can be exhilarating too when you swing high up and get on top of buildings. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough. I hope this is not spamming you as it‚Äôs on the bottom of the review, but should you find this helpful, please consider using my lnk below.

Got a bunch of cozy/sim/adventure/casual games, go take a look if you're interested!) I was not planning on buying Windlands, but it was in a bundle I was interested in so I gave it a try, and I am so happy I did. I was a bit hesitant to play it at first, I bought my meta recently and I'm still getting used to it, and Windlands seemed pretty intense. And it is, a bit, but I also find it really freeing. I love to jump around and try to get very high, there's no pressure from the game and you can play at your own pace. Felt a little sick though, not gonna lie, but I feel like I'm getting used to it! I'd avise this game for people looking for a nice and contemplative experience, and who like to feel like they're flying. I'm not done with the game yet, I'm taking my time but having a lot of fun with it, and the lore seems really interesting as well I'll definitely buy Windlands 2 when I get the chance!",Hi Even in 2023 it is still ne of the most immersive experience! The only complaint I have on Quest2 is that the there is still NO NOISE around the stone tablets to collect. The stone noise around the tablets is very helpfull to locate them even when you don't see them Did you notice that ? Can you fix this please? thanks,I played through this game on easy it was a lot of fun and it will get you familiar with the mechanics of the game. Then I started a new game on hard and let me just say my hands were so sweaty afterwards that I had to get a hand towel to keep playing! The only enemy in this game is gravity! You will learn a new skill set in hard mode that doesn‚Äôt become known in easy mode. If you like parkour type games you will enjoy this game!
