She was a Franco-Spanish painter and a key figure in the pictorial revival that took place in Europe during the First World War. Her relentless artistic career, her impressive biography as a genius from the time she was a child with physical difficulties, and her extraordinary intelligence made her stand out, especially as a member and only woman of L'Ã©cole de Paris, This VR Museum is intended to pay tribute to the great artist and to introduce her work and language as a painter and theoretician to the interested public.",3+,,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity","English, Spanish (Spain)",1.0,Virtual Video SL,Virtual Video SL,http://www.mariablanchard.org/,"Jun 21, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5110637382305685/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5110637382305685&r=1, http://www.virtualvideo.org/",1.63 GB,
