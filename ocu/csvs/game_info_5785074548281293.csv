The puzzle-solving mechanics, featuring 19th century German people and furniture, provide an enjoyable challenge. The controls are easy to grasp, and I like the fact that it works without controllers, just with hand tracking. It also works offline. Overall, it's a great VR experience that history enthusiasts and puzzle lovers will appreciate. Edit: There are now new levels with fish and butterfly puzzles that I am looking forward to trying out.",First of all I appreciate how the instructions for use are in quick visuals ( I learned how to use my hand tracking quickly by controller placement). The articulation you can perform with the puzzle pieces while hand tracking is beautifully executed. I appreciate the fact that you can take a puzzle piece and bring it up close to glance at the 1800's art (gives me classic carnival faire feels). All levels promise to have a look and feel for their theme. Overall a very immersive experience for a classically relaxing pastime.,Very simple game with a unique look. Puzzling through the 19th century fashion and design is fun and meditative.
