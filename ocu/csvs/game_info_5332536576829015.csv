It uses a fully physics-based animation system to simulate NPC behaviors and reactions, allowing you to interact with them as if you were in the real world. NPCs have realistic AI, displaying emotions such as happiness, anger, fear, or affection. Their emotions will change depending on your actions. You can provoke and fight with anyone, dance and kiss with girls, but be careful when approaching a girl as her boyfriend might be around.

If you have full relationship bar make it so you can do more adult stuff with the npc 2. Add more guns because 1 pistol is boring 3. Make it so the people on the strip poles actually strip 4. Make it so you can have ally NPC's 5. Make it so NPCs will follow you when you beckon them,"I love this game! But I think there should be more things to do 1. Multiplayer is first, I would love to fight my friends( make the same map just without npc‚Äôs and just for online people, also private servers and public!!) 2. Make more areas to go to! I would love to have a home and other places to go! 3. I love the bartender! Just I think we should be able to use our money to buy drinks( make a menu) 4. Food! I have no clue why I just think this would be so cool!ü§£ 5. Make it that if the npc‚Äôs kiss you or dance with you that you don‚Äôt hit them on accident! I think it‚Äôs fun dancing with npc‚Äôs with a full relationship bar, but at a point I hit them and it goes down! If you can‚Äôt do It I completely understand! This game in all is amazing I would just love and not just me but the whole community would love to have more stuff to do! But my main thing that I would love and others would too is multiplayer and more options for the npc‚Äôs! Thank you!","I love the game it's a good way to pass time, and the ragdolls are fun, and the combat feels right for fists, at least. I only have few things that I don't like or would like to see added: 1. The melee weapons (knife,axe, etc) make the enemies feel light weight and and if u try to pull out the weapon, they almost fly in that direction (exaggerating). 2. I think a weapon that can stick enemies to walls (bow,spear,machete, etc) would be cool and fun to see, especially with how good the ragdoll physics are. 3. I also think adding challenges to unlock different skins like u have kill the entire night club with just ur fist to unlock a boxer as a wearable skin (might have special powers like punch enemies far or one punch enemies). P.s. I'll still love the game even if u dont add this stuff. Just keep doing what u doin üëç",1 when you kill someone a person who is near will pick them up and bring them to safety away from the player 2 ak47 as it would be a great weapon the the game 3 you can grab someone and if pull hard enough you‚Äôll rip of their limb Hope these get. Put into the game Oh and number4 is where yiu can take people hostage,"Hello Nightclub dancing creators, I have been playing this game since the beginning, it has been an amazing progress, it started all as just dancing and fighting then when weapons were introduced then security guards and knifes, better physics, and now guns, this game is amazing and great job with all the progress all of y'all have made. I would like for some things to be added, probably like more guns and the shotguns is a little glitchy but besides that the game is perfect. 5/5‚≠ê"
