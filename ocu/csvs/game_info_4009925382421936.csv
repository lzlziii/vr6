Graphically this is better but what made that game was the brilliant modes. Like the party game mode with the dartboard or the fairground mode and the different environments. If this game can provide those sort of modes then it will be a winner for sure. So fingers crossed. In terms of physics the heading is fine and goes where I want it. The keeper I didn’t like the ball going through my body. I felt that as a keeper you catch it with your hands and body at same time. With the call going through your body it didn’t seem right. So good demo but what will make this game is the fun modes - If there are some,"Woooow I'm football player i can say this could be huge game we all waiting for , until we get the full version hope this will be soon"
