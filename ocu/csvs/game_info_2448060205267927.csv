Beat Saber,Beat Saber is a unique VR rhythm game where your goal is to slash the beats (represented by small cubes) as they are coming at you. Every beat indicates which saber you need to use and also the direction you need to match. All the music is composed to perfectly fit the handmade levels. Our goal is to make players almost dance while cutting the cubes and avoiding obstacles. Each cut is strongly supported by great sound and visual effects to emphasize the rhythm.,3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Casual, Mixed Reality, Music & Rhythm","English, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Venezuela)","1.31.0_5257753291

Even people who don't know much about VR have probably seen a video of playing Beat Saber at least once. When you start the game, you will see two lightsabers in each hand and a cube slowly approaching you. From this point on, you already intuitively know what to do yourself, don't have to press a button or do any complicated manipulations. just cut them to the rhythm! After enjoying the basic contents of this game enough, you will be able to get another pleasure if you enter the world of BMBF. This is a tool that applies user-created mods to the game, and can be used in a variety of ways, such as changing to a desired saber or adding detailed features. There's nothing better than actually playing this game yourself. If you already got Quest 2, definitely buy this game. It will give you the best VR experience you will never regret. Was this helpful?

I absolutely love this game and the music, so please more. 🙏If there were music packs like this in smash drums , i would play it more to Awesome ! Pink Floyd the wall could be insane graphically , and awesome mapping 🙏 and some cool techno and rave tunes. Come on guys when is it going to be open to download all music? Love beat Saber but the music gets boring very quickly.","When you buy a 30 dollar game you would reasonably think that you would be able to play the songs that the game is advertising, well not with beat saber! When you buy just the base game you get the bare minimum, 99% of the included song and just a beat that was made in five minutes looped until the song ends and the very few actual songs with actual word that don’t just loop for 2-5 minutes are the most annoying, nails on chalk board deafening “songs” ever created. Don’t buy this game unless you’re willing to sell an arm a leg and your first born child to play the songs that are actually fun. Btw 5 stars so I would show up near the top",🍀 🧠🧠 🧠🧠🧠 🧠🧠🧠🧠 🧠🧠🏴🏴 🧠🧠🧠🧠 🧠🧠☁️☁️ 🧠🧠⌚️⌚️ 🧠🧠☁️☁️ 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠 🧠🧠🔨🥿🥿🥿 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠 🍀🍀🧠🧠🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀 👾🍀🧠🧠🍀🍀🍀👾👾👾 👾👾🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀👾 🍀🍀 🍀🍀 🧠 🧠
