Don‚Äôt be afraid to make a mistake and fail. Remember that death is just the beginning in Shadows of Kurgansk!",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Horror, Shooter","English, Russian",1.1.0.0,Gaijin Distribution Kft,Gaijin Distribution Kft,https://gaijindistribution.com/,"Feb 24, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4385011931597478/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4385011931597478&r=1, https://legal.gaijin.net/privacypolicy",Terms of Service,561.2 MB,"If Into the Radius wasn‚Äôt a thing this game would be much better. It‚Äôs too similar to Into the Radius (another S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-ish game) for it‚Äôs good, ITR flaunts Kurgansk in most everything. If you want a game like this your going to buy ITR, Kurgansk needs more definition apart from being a downgrade. To distinguish it, in my opinion it‚Äôd be better to emphasize on a base-Building aspect similar to 7 days to die, where in you fortify with barbed wire and traps to protect you from night time enemies. An addition of a puzzle element would be neat to where players could find clues around the map to unlock things. It needs better user interface tho too.",This game would have been a lot better if the developer wouldn't have gave up on this game. It's too hard to Sprint or run in the game. It would be a lot better if everyone could have a option in which you could run or Sprint without having to press hard on the remote. It would have been a real good game. It's just a waste of time and money. Don't waste your money.. SMH,"I have been on the fence about this for a while but purchased it and I think it has great potential, graphics are pretty decent the only issue I have is texture and object pop in which I hope will be improved over time but I like the cel shaded graphics, the gameplay is great fun although I don't know if it's a bug but I can't seem to fire a gun with my right hand which is very frustrating being right handed so please update, there needs to be some sort of manual height/holster adjustment for comfort and also when I turn it still has comfort setting on even though I disabled it, lastly I think the physics could see some improvements and also more options in the settings to help with comfort and immersion but I do believe after some updates and some fixes this game could be amazing, I do recommend it and I will definitely give it 5 star's once the bugs and improvements have been implemented, overall great game worth the asking price. Developer's if you read this I do hope you'll take into account what I've mentioned because this game has amazing potential so I look forward to future updates",Don‚Äôt buy 2/10,Are you guys still working on this awesome game? I need more please!!üòáüòáüôèüôèüëªüëç
