high2earth,"high2earth allows you to travel virtually to many locations around the world: Rome, Seattle, Munich, Mount Everest, New Your and many other exciting places. You can enter your own locations or use a small pre-selection available in the main menu of this app. Apart from that, you can also check the current weather in the places you visit virtually. Over 400 cities can be displayed in 3D. Natural wonders like the Grand Canyon, the Dolomites or other mountain landscapes are all in 3D without exception.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Educational, Exploration, Travel",English,6,highlewelt,highlewelt GmbH,https://www.highlewelt.com/,"Jul 12, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/8372285682797266/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=8372285682797266&r=1, https://highlewelt.com/privacy.html",132.6 MB,"ðŸ‘‰webnetka*com ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· metaquest*forumactif*comðŸ‘ˆ I tested for you... and you can move on! - the presentation images of a city in relief are misleading: they are only valid on pre-selected locations (9 ?). Elsewhere you have totally flat cities, difficult to read and barely recognizable - navigation: just disastrous. Basically you can just scroll inside the map rectangle, and teleport (but not at all on a point of the map: no, outside! interest close to zero, especially given the following point) - and in fact you must not move from your place, because that's where there is a slider to zoom in / out: there's no control on the joysticks for that! In practice, you want to see your city? you type his name in the search, you are taken there, but it's difficult to recognize anything and navigation hassle, limits motion sickness Personally, I didn't recognize my city or my neighborhood, and I gave up As for Paris, it is not even in relief so nothing to see and not much to recognize either (on the other hand the mont st michel exists, even if little to see) Brief: 1/ I don't understand why it's on sale, even on the applab, because the experience (navigation) is really horrible and the content (9 sites with nothing to do in it but take a look) more than limited. This content, moreover, is really not worth the price: you go around it in 5 minutes, not to mention the nervousness caused to just move around and try to recognize 2/ to my knowledge, it's an abandoned project, which has never had an update since its release. So something not finished but immediately abandoned: I don't understand how you can sell such a thing, complete jerkiness You have been warned","just tried: the app does its job well in the essential part, it is satisfactory. but the menu interface is annoying, not very intuitive, and there are errors. if i write rome or taranto or other italian cities instead of taking me to italy it takes me to america. instead the pre-set view of rome works by choosing it from the available places. it does not zoom as easily as expected, it does not have handtraking 2.0 and also in this app the passtrought would be perfect, to look at the world and keep an eye on the environment since the map is small. to improve the user interface and add several options, thanks - P.s. : but this is not the wooorld app? https://youtu.be/a799iAChorI I think you have released this app now because in a few months the wooorld app would be out and then you would not sell anymore, anyway ok, but I am afraid that as soon as the wooorld comes out you will stop updating the app, because it already has a lot of things to improve in the menu, in fact I am almost certain that it will remain in its current state of development, I hope I am wrong","Google Earth part is awesome and well done. However the UI and controller interaction is very poorly done. This is shame because apps like this is excellent to show off VR experience to non gamers and old forks. But when UI and how controller works only frustrate me, trying to explain how to use UI and controller to let's say my parents who have zero gaming experience would be impossible.","The overall conceit of this app is great: you look down on very detailed cityscapes and landscapes. The UI needs a lot of work. It is not intuitive and buggy. Trying to get around can be frustrating and really lessen the experience. Once the UI issues are resolved though, this will be a must-have for education.","High2Earth is a great idea and a fun way to view the world, it's a pop up 3D model version of Google Earth ðŸŒŽ. Im happy to have it sense Google Earth isn't available on the stand alone headset or anything else like it. Very cool ðŸ˜Š. It can definitely use some work so I hope there will be some updates. Im happy to have it , well worth the $4.99 and I think it was only something like 130 megabytes so happy to have it in my apps."
