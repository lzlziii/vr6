I bought this based on the latter and the preview of the play space. There are multiple tables, and each has mini-games. In one such mini-game, I was transported to Darth Vader, and we dueled. In another, I was riding on a thing through the forest, and I had to dodge trees while firing at the enemy ahead. I love Career Mode because it gives a different objective for me to achieve on each mission. I expect to have endless playability due to having Career Mode with objectives, plus Arcade and Classic modes, which I have yet to explore. For those wanting to really master the tables, each table has an in-game guide. This game can be enjoyed by Star Wars fans and pinball lovers alike.","I own 3 actual, not VR, pinball tables. I have tried Computer, Mobile and Tablets but the tables do not satisfy my needs. These, Star Wars, are incredible. Someone has worked REALLY hard on the physics of these games and the graphics are awesome. They react REALLY well and are very convincing. My only, very minor, gripes are that when making a choice you must use the ""A"" button when the usual convention of the Trigger would be better. When using the ""TILT"" facility, it would be better/easier to use the ""Side Triggers"" rather than the joysticks.","Do I need to have played an earlier version in order to know how to play this game??? I didn't know what various buttons perform, how to move around, etc., etc. Somewhere it mentioned an 'RG' button. What the heck is that? I hope there is a tutorial somewhere, otherwise it feels like I just wasted 24.99/","Star Wars adds nice collectible features and offers fun tables but this title lacks the polish that the other Zen Studios Pinball FX2 VR had. The UI/UX could use some work (e.g. not being able to see table placement adjustments until hitting apply, and many other random small weird things). I'm playing on Quest 1 and visual clarity and performance are both worse compared to Pinball FX2. Not sure if it's because of Unreal Engine or less time optimizing compared to their previous work but I expected better given other Zen titles and the fact it's the Star Wars license... I really hope to see all pinball titles get VR support going forward because the genre lends itself PERFECTLY to VR.",The fancave is awesome. The tables are awesome. The controls are for sh*t. I took a chance that the bad reviews were wrong. Nope. It freezes up on the Quest 2. It jumps height in the middle of playing. It thinks every movement is TILT and boots you out. So disappointed. This could've been amazing if they had cared enough to make it playable.
