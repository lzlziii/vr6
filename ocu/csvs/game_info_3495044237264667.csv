It's just like Bigscreen but for Karaoke. Just installed 2 days ago and cant stop using it. Mic has been improved since last update. No delay at all. Some songs are cut from the edges when they are shown on screen. Hope you can fix this. Thanks to the team for making such an incredible app.ü•Ωüé§üòç,"Honestly, I feel like even though this app is meant to just sing karaoke in front of a crowd/group setting, it can be used for practicing speeches and helping in overcome stage fright too! I would love to see the devs add in some like realistic looking audience models instead of just the flickering lights. It‚Äôs been a while since I last played but that is what I remembered from it. I would use this app for pretending to speak on stages to overcome my stage fright rather than sing because I‚Äôm not a good singer üòÇ so again I think this app could be more beneficial to also tackle that aspect of stage speaking! Maybe add like classroom environments for simulating giving presentations or even like a TED talk type of stage lol. Even having an interactive white board would be kool! Possibilities are endless. Just an idea. üòÉ",I‚Äôd like to see more Elvis Presley songs added. I‚Äôm a Elvis impersonator and I love using this app just to practice.,"Fantastic idea and I'm glad someone has made a karaoke game, it's just unplayable at the moment on the quest 2 due to a lag on the microphone to what you hear in game. Kind of defeats the object of karaoke but the rest works fine. It's a shame and hopefully soon this will be fixed so I can enjoy playing the game","There is a LOT of lag and SO MUCH REVERB with the microphone turned on (Oculus 2), but I just turned the volume all the way down and sang my heart out for like 90 minutes. My headset ran out of battery and powered itself off... RIP. Even with the mic volume off, it was really fun to be able to see the microphone in my hand (so much better than holding a hairbrush, amirite?) and see the reflection of my avatar in the mirror! SO CUTE!"
