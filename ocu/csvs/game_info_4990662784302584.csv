Unique take on the punch and dodge to music!",**Update 6.27 Thx for the quick fix. Hoping leaderboard scores stick with future updates to keep the gamified competitive dopamine motivation high:) ____ Previous: Increased to 5 stars as Devs fixed level saving bug within 48 hours To Devs: There is still an issue with stage moving on some levels which can be a little dangerous throwing punches Website seems to be down. Would be great to have a way to contact for any bugs or suggestions rather than through reviews. Game has great potential and would love to contribute to help realize that potential. Previous: Devs great game but recent update will not save past the 2nd level. Personally liked previous option to choose level based on rounds depending on how much time I have to workout. Would be great to be able to switch up the different balls as an option as each had a different cool feel. In the future would be great to complete multiplayer. Overall one of my favorite workout games from someone who used to box. Will update to 5 stars once glitch is fixed.. keep up the good work!,"It really doesn't feel like you're having a workout because it's just so freaking fun but this game is LEGIT - you really work up a sweat! The music is great, everything looks awesome and you really get caught up in it. Definitely one of my favourites, it really so well done and even though it's already a complete game and totally polished, the updates keep coming all the time. So excited to see what they do next!","I absolutely love this game. I've played it for a little while now and a lot of features have been added since I first started playing. I love how the developers keep improving this game, I find exciting, just when I get to a point where the game is verging on the edge of monotony the developers come in and make improvements to keep me engaged. I love the new weapons being launched at me The 2 ninjas at the start is pretty cool I like how I can now select different levels and that I can skip the break in between rounds. I heard some new music as well, would love to be able to run music of YouTube or Spotify etc. I like the bears standing at the top of the launch pad indicating which weapons you can expect flying at you. The balls coming at you still needs a little tweaking they do start flying way overhead at certain points in the game. This is a unique and brilliant fitness game, one that gets you ducking and diving & bobbing and weaving. I am constantly burning of between 300 and 600 calories every day and it is a lot more engaging than some of the other fitness games I have.",awesome Game. But settings for color blind would be great. the colors of the balls are difficult to tell apart. Update: no colorproblems anymore!
