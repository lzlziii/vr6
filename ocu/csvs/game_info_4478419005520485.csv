Swordsman,"Swordsman is a physics-based medieval combat game designed for virtual reality. The game features Knights, Vikings, Mongols, Samurai, Pirates, realistic armor physics, epic boss fights and powerful boss weapons, a Kraken, RPG player progression and customization, a Blacksmith, Armorer and Skill Master to help you build a character suited to your playstyle and lots of items to buy and unlock, all in effort to stop the J√∂tunn from taking over the world. The J√∂tunn has recruited captains from all over the world, giving them godly weapons with which to command powerful armies. He wields seemingly infinite power: Hellfire. Swordsman also features gameplay modifiers. These will let you change how the core game works in fun and interesting ways. Hardcore enemies, invisible enemies (floating swords), Doomfist (super strength), the ability to slow time down whenever you want and many more.",18+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,Games,", Action, Fighting, Simulation","English, Chinese (China), Chinese (Hong Kong), French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Venezuela)","N/A

I know it‚Äôs compared to Blades & Sorcery a lot but I feel it‚Äôs worth mentioning as to why this game is better than B&S for me. You can‚Äôt just aggressively thrash your sword into an enemy and brain-dead an encounter, it takes skill and precision. I still find myself getting overconfident and getting aggressive and rushing an enemy and quickly getting humbled. It requires you to carefully watch your enemy and find ways to punish the gaps they left open in their attacks and attack gaps in their armor. This is easily the most realistic sparring/sword fighting game I‚Äôve seen. As a big sword nerd, it does me justice. I‚Äôm excited to see what more content is to come.",For me I thought until crystal hunt came out battle talent was undefeated in swordplay I mean in game mods unbeatable but I was wrong swordsman has bosses weapons where you can progress with insane boss fights obtaining there weapon like a Viking who has a lightning axe or a hell warrior with the hell sword it even has a skill slot where you can upgrade yourself it never gets boring but one thing I‚Äôm a quest 2 player and the graphics I play in are worse than the the stuff i see this before the quest pro came out ( it‚Äôs overrated and overpriced) I just wish you guys could update the graphics a little more My only other gripes are that there aren‚Äôt enough 1v1 sword duels and the players need more hp a lot of the time when I want a faire duel with slow paced combat I still take damage from the boss or enemy,If you want more physics then blade and sorcery is better but if you want better ai and a more realistic sword play experience then THIS is the game for you! Please feel free to dm me if you would like the code,"‚û°Ô∏è questlinks.bio.link This game fights are much more realistic than blade and sorcery, prepare to wet and get frustrated cause after 20 minutes of trying to kill a boss you will get one hit and die. I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è",This is genuinely a good game. I love the challenge and different classes. And all for a good price. Definitely a buy üëç Bit(dot)ly/OculusDisc Replace the (dot) with a period for tons of coupons Please like the post it really helps!!!
