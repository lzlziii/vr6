All normal procedures and five emergency procedures are represented here. Buttons can be toggled, majority of the displays are simulated, and step-by-step instructions are available for the whole process. In addition, the sim offers an Explore Mode where you can read more info about specific buttons and switches. The developer has stated that the sim will continue to receive updates so this will be a good training investment. If you wanna try it out before purchasing, check out the demos for this and the A320 sim also listed on App Lab. This sim isn't a replacement for a full featured sim like MSFS2020 or X-Plane, but it's a nice companion that offers portability of not needing a full gaming PC and the ability to train anywhere, even while on travel."
