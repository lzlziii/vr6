Enemys know ur location every round. Enemies skins Are horrid and the furthest from realistic. When i got this game i expected it to be like hitman yk. You spawn in with a silenced pistol and a mission, and u can hide behind stuff be silent, or go subdue others. But this. This is absolute s**t",I really like the game and it could go big of you are consistent with the updates I only have 1 issue I want to be able to shoot someone is the foot/leg and then fall down or get stunned,Please focus on making this game multiplayer!!!!,"I have some ideas I think you should add -New npc skins -assault rifle -new maps -snap turn -option to lower npc voices (it sounds like I’m getting yelled at up close when they are on the other side of the room) -slow motion -npcs will fall over if shot in the legs -if shot in both legs they will be incapacitated and stay on the ground longer No need to rush mr. developer, this is just what I think would be cool. Have a good day.","The game offers a lot of game modes, which is the only good thing about it. It steals the characters from Drunkn Bar Fight. There is 3 underwhelming guns and all of the other weapons have horrible mechanics. The NPCS do not vary much and are too powerful. The maps are also stolen from various games. All of the NCPS also scream the phrase, “The enemy is right there! Shoot!” The game modes are all almost the same. The graphics look like they are from the early 2000s. Don’t buy this. Save up for a better one."
