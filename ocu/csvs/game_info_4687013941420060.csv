The title photo is much more colorful than the actual game and most of the game is in hazy two tone in a futuristic human ruined ocean. Plastic beach I was perplexed because it's really a cave and no plastic anywhere. There wasn't enough messages of the problems the oceans are having as far as sea life being affected. An occasional animal you need to free from some trash. As the game goes on you start going down deep tunnels and it turns into underground buildings that if you are claustrophobic might trigger you. The game goes from sea creatures to dodging zapping red orbs and you constantly have to maneuver through sonic blasting towers that sound like Darth Vader and I found the game to be anxiety triggering and not anymore much about sea creatures in the ocean. Mostly just underwater corridors and collapsed buildings to find your way through. I finished it to see the end but I feel disappointed. It's a long game, which is great, and you can go back to previous levels and overall it was good. The music is excellent and sets a mood and I did enjoy swimming around and looking in every corner of the different areas. I have chronic pain and the floating sensation is therapeutic. It was relaxing until I see that menacing red orb or flashes of red waves and know I have to maneuver it to move on.","I played 5x startot new. Now i have this item for to strong Swimming. But the first map we have 2-3 Teil where we can’t swim in. How can I start with this item again the First map?or how can I back too? 2. how can I save der Orca in Clocktower map? And clocktower map, why I can’t inside come to the tunel (Metro) near an Ballon Fish???befor i join in to Stadion???? This is a Bug?!?!? Or wtf?","I love this game, it's so unique, particularly when you discover that you're a dolphin! You can spend hours exploring the beautiful seascapes, evading drones, and figuring out how to disable generators. When I let my friend try it, she quickly fell in love with it. My only issue is that of all the treasures I can't find the gold vase in Poseidon. I've looked all around the area it's supposed to be in, according to the guides for the original platform. I can tell that it's there with echolocation, but I can't get close to it. There are unbreakable rocks in the way. Is there a plan to make it accessible to Quest users? Or is there a hidden passage that I'm missing?",When you discover that you’re the dolphin the game takes on a whole new meaning. So much fun! Exploring and discovering such a great immersive game. Can play it for hours easily.
