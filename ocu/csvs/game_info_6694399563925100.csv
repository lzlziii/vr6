StairWell,"Stairwell is a spine-chilling VR game that plunges you into the depths of an endless staircase descending into the abyss. Armed only with a lighter and a torch, you'll have to navigate your way down the treacherous steps and unravel the mystery of what lies at the bottom. As you descend further into the abyss, the environment will become increasingly ominous and otherworldly. You'll encounter strange symbols etched into the walls, and whispers that seem to come from nowhere will taunt and torment you as you make your way down. But you're not alone in the abyss. As you descend deeper, you'll encounter otherworldly creatures that will try to impede your progress. You'll need to keep your wits about you and use your torch and lighter to find your way down.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Horror, Puzzle",English,1.91,Nordis Interactive LLC,Nordis Interactive LLC,https://nordisinteractive.com/,"Jun 23, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6694399563925100/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6694399563925100&r=1, https://www.privacypolicies.com/live/1bdce2fd-cbbb-49bb-bb71-d2feee63dcd5",142.8 MB,"I was kept on edge, the environment and the sounds and the guy who suddenly crawled and groaned his way out of the concrete wall had me growing more and more cautious. Now for the but… it was only a couple minutes in that my big ol friend scared the absolute f%*k out of me and killed me. I don’t see a way to evade this, maybe it’s supposed to happen bc it’s a demo? It doesn’t really make much sense bc it just sends me straight back to the beginning. I’d definitely add in something to make this distinguishable besides just saying I died and resetting. I’d add in an inventory to allow me to switch between the flashlight and lighter as necessary There should definitely be notes to collect and read to build some story and diversity as you progress that add some mystery and depth to the experience. Make the enemy avoidable somehow, maybe small rooms that branch out to allow you to slip past and begin a pursuit as you move down Add a sprint feature (this is a must if you have hostile entities that you have to escape) I want to give this a better review in the future, if this game is still in the makes, but right now 3 stars was being kind. If not for atmosphere and actually being decently startling I’d have given it 1/2 stars. It has potential, and I paid the .99 cents giving it the benefit of the doubt but I probably won’t play it again until I see updates and added features"
