PentaPuzzle Demo,PentaPuzzle is an immersive puzzle game for the Oculus Quest VR headset. The game offers simple but beautiful puzzles that range from easy to very hard. The 12 unique PentaPuzzle pieces are all created by the combination of five squares. From this deceptively simple design endless combinations and challenges arise to keep you lingering between annoyance and achievement. The amazing interactive soundtrack develops according to your progress and is composed by Matthew Herbert and Sam Beste.,3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Educational, Puzzle, Relaxation/Meditation",English,0.0.6,Skrubbeltrang & Platz,Skrubbeltrang & Platz,https://pentapuzzle.com/,"Apr 22, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5258630727511783/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5258630727511783&r=1, https://pentapuzzle.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,59.8 MB,"Interesting way to do puzzles. I like the challenge. However, there should be different environments and maybe actual levels for degree of difficulty. I would also rather use my hands than the controllers.","I like it. I found it easy but it maybe just me. It is like a quick puzzle and it was fun. The hardest part is to remember the pieces. Graphics looks weird sometimes... I see a crooked lines due to low resolution. Overall, I ma pretty impress. The way the game is made, it should be easy to generate puzzles. I would advise to make different level based on how many solutions are possible for the same puzzle. Also I wish more music. And different backgrounds than just stars. For example, add planets, comets, etc...",Try it you won't regret playing this puzzles,"It would probably be quite nice if it worked. It could do with some sort of instructions on how to move the grid in where I presume the puzzle is meant to be built, if its possible to move it. It says sitting, but if I'm sitting down, the grid is way above my head and out of reach. I can pull the puzzle pieces down in front of me, but the grid won't budge and pointing at the setting wheel and clicking doesn't do anything either. So, since I'm not able to stand very well atm, I can't really test it.","The app is put together well and is easy to use. It's not all that difficult, definitely worth a try if you like solving puzzles."
