You can check it out in my top 10 best app lab games list: https://youtu.be/8ZG7KHOOan8","This is one of those ""hidden gems"" you hear about on App Lab. My friends and I played everything except chess and everything was fun, although some like Korean One Card could use some explanation (we figured it out through trial and error). And Othello might have a glitch where discs occasionally flip that shouldn't (I put mine down and a disc on the other side of the board nowhere near it flipped. But hey, I won!) One of my friends has way too much fun hitting everyone with the hammer, but I don't suppose that's the developer's fault. This is a really strong beginning. I hope you add more games (but please, please lose the turn timers, or at least offer the option to turn them off). This will be in our lineup of weekly play dates for sure!","It is an application that allows you to easily enjoy bard games. if you have friends, i recommed that you enjoy them together. Current entertainment includes chess and Otehllo, Yacht, Korean-Onecard and StackUp! I like StackUp the best. I recommend the StackUp",The handful of games are fun and easy to get into. I hope more games are on the way. Thoroughly enjoyed this app.,"Maybe Im just dumb, but it wont let me open any games or inv anyone in the menu"
