The latest update is too bright , extremely laggy choppy rendering and overall really uncomfortable experience. Now that I have made a habit of playing this ...I try to endure and start feeling motion sick with the picture jumping around. I think they tried to make it brighter to add sunlight and then shadows to match. It screwed everything up. Also suddenly defending the ball on the highest difficulty sends it for a six making the whole experience really disappointing. Why guys? You had an amazing game !!",Should have option to hold bat with 2 hands and need little better visualisation,This is fun. The difficulty comes in gripping your controller like a bat. If you’ve played cricket in real life this is uncomfortable but use left hand to grip controller and right on ring. What really needs an improvement is that it needs to recognize the body. I know it’s easier said than done but there has to be someway to recognize a body where ball would not go to the stump (and isn’t lbw) May be the bat swing can aid a natural body movement ? It becomes a problem with leg spin (to a right handed) when pitching outside leg. There’s no way I’ll be bowled in that trajectory. But fun ! I wish it’s improved !,It was an amazing experience to play this game but need to work more on graphics,"got the demo and gave it a go. not a massive fan of cricket but this is really good. holding the bat with one hand is weird but you get used to it. the geering when you get bowled out is annoying but only in a ""i cant believe ive been bowled out"" way. its a mix of old school graphics and imersive playability. love it"
