This game is even made that much better if you are playing currently on a Quest Pro and in the future of a Quest 3 to utilize the color passthrough. You are able to create your own roller coaster with drops, turns, twists, and barrel rolls all in a virtual or mixed reality environment. The game is very easy to build your coasters with and very kid friendly too, making this game fun for all ages. You can decorate your own environment with various objects such as trees to add to the scenery of your awesome ride! Once you have built your perfect roller coaster you can take it for a ride and experience what it would be like to really be on it! I really think this might be the future of riding roller coasters! You can also share and upload your finished coaster so other people can ride it via the community board, which is a great feature for hundreds of different coaster so the fun never ends! The thing that i would like to see is if you could add a friend to the coaster top ride with you. I also would like to be able to ride my coaster in my mixed reality environment. I might have missed it but it seemed that i could only ride it in the virtual world. Other than that its a great game for a good price!","Hey developer's What a great update! 1.I love the new Grid tool Now we can build more accurately and faster than before making the surroundings look more professional. *Question; Does the grid tool help you keep the rails at 180 degrees horizontally please? 2. Nice soundtrack ( no sirens YAY! ) 3. I love the checkpoint flag idea *Question; could we check and run a track in first person from the checkpoint please? Suggestion; *Could we have a second map option without raised boarders as someone may want to build 'Wuhu Island' for example. *Could we have an option please to have a 2D view of the map with a grid to paint land and sea, for creating Yuhu island or other interesting map shapes Then jump back into 3d mode and create tall mountains etc. Many thanks for using my silly 3 headed yellow snake for the community section, I'm glad you like them üòÇ This is a brilliant rollercoaster sim game I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I will be continuing large projects once the optimisation updates hits the Quest 2 or on the Quest 3 Great game buy it! Five stars from me ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",Very fun Roller Coaster building game. Its easy to use. I can't wait to see more !,This game got me back into VR when I was bored of it. The gameplay is great and being able to upload your creations is great as well! I love this game because I had a childhood of roller coaster tycoon games and this brings my memories back!,"This game has great potential it‚Äôs fun for a short while but there is only so much you can do. I know it is early access and it still has a long way to becoming a good game, but for now I give it a 3/5 stars."
