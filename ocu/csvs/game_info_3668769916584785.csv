Pool Cubed,"FINALLY! Version 1.1 with an experimental online multiplayer mode! Also full American 8-ball rules, expanded Arcade Mode, and an open sandbox practice mode. Support us at http://patreon.com/cavemanlabs or contact us on our website at http://cavemanlabs.com/contact-us to give us your feedback. In Pool Cubed, we've exploded the classic pool table into a whole new dimension... and unapologetically twisted it into a first-person-shooter in the process. Now you can literally shoot pool... in VR! This version has two play modes, complete with bar-room ambience. There's a ""classic mode"" for a more familiar experience, and a dual-wielding ""arcade"" mode with a more modern flair. This is a sneak-peek at a true one-of-a-kind VR experience that will only get better as we add more features. Join us on this journey and get it while it's free.

Add another twist by trading in cues for pistols. It isn't really pool any more, but it's not really not pool either. Whatever, it's a lot of fun.","It’s a super fun game to play. It’s exactly what it looks like, so, if you think the concept of 3D pool is cool, you will also like this game. I didn’t play it for that long because I’ve always got bored quickly in single player games. That being said, this is the single player game that I played for the longest amount of time.","Its the classic game of pool but you can walk around and shoot the balls in from a VR cube pool table. Pretty crazy this is being offered for free, needs to get multiplayer but as it is now I can 100 percent recommend checking it out. Definitely an app lab hidden gem.
