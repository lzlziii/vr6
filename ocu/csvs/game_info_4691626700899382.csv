Mixture,"Mixture is a fantasy action-adventure in which two enemies in an alliance of necessity traverse barren worlds in a quest for redemption.

The story and characters give a sense that the team who made it had passion, but the actual game design has a slew of serious flaws, some of which had me quit out several times. * Visual feedback for Sola's combat is lackluster. Enemies do not give enough feedback when hit so it's easy to wonder if you're swinging out of range or actually hitting. There's not much in the way of appreciable hitsparks, there's no hit-stop whatsoever as far as I can tell, flinch animations can be difficult to discern from dying animations, the enemies themselves don't have a strongly visible flash or anything when hit. Sometimes the health 'dial' around the enemy will also clip through the floor so you're left uncertain if they're flinching or dying until they get back up/dissolve. * Checkpointing is awful at several parts of the game. There's quite a few that are a decent walk away from something that can kill you, so you're forced to trudge back to the actually dangerous bit, wasting a bunch of time. One particularly bad checkpoint for me though was in idol up: I quit out because I was low on battery and when I returned the checkpoint was ABOVE a monster that blocks access to alchemic resources and you obviously start with none so I had to go back down to kill the mob and any that spawned before climbing back up to the checkpoint to continue from where I left off. * Randomly dying is a big problem. I've lost count of how many times I've done the jump attack and instead of slamming into the ground I've fallen through the map and died (the most recent memory of it was right in the middle of the raft to the idol up level). There's also a fairly inconsistent fall distance that will kill you in mid-air if you go down too much, even though sola can glide. * 'Platforming' can be inconsistent. One bounce I had to deal with in Idol up wasn't high enough the first 3 times but was fine the 4th attempt. What did I do different? nothing as far as I can tell :/",Am roughly half way through the game and I'm having a blast only bad part is when my oculus dies and I have to wait for it to charge again so I can play more. Super fun combat and throwing mixtures at enemies and the hack and slash play really keeps me engaged. Boss battles are really cool and challenging. Edit. I changed my review after completing the game. About half way through the game became pretty repetitive and kind of boring and the combat wasn't fun and the *puzzles were more annoying than a fun challenge. The camera angles at times made me fly off and die after completing a challenging battle forcing me to replay it over and over again. The final boss battle I didn't even complete because it just bothered me and I kept dying and it wasn't a fun challenge more just dashing and hoping you don't get hit. Not a bad game and good parts and a cool concept just overall it didn't deliver as a whole.,"Watch my video review on YouTube IronbugVR - Mixture Mixture is a first person and third person platforming game. It has gameplay similar to the game Moss. You will control a small character named Sola and guide her through the levels. At the same time you will also play in first person as a powerful alchemist helping Sola on her way. I found this game to be more interactive from the first person view, and the combat much more challenging from the third person view. This is a great platformer / first person adventure, that is challenging and has some epic giant boss fights. If you are a fan of Moss and are looking for the next great VR platforming adventure, pickup Mixture. This game will not disappoint.","Update: Thanks for the quick reply! I played it some more at lunch. The atmosphere keeps drawing me back in. The combat is getting more challenging but also more interesting from a strategic standpoint. I also made it to a more involved platforming section that had a bit of light puzzle solving. I‚Äôm raising my score. Original Review: A word of warning for Moss fans who have read the ‚Äúif you love Moss, you‚Äôll love Mixture‚Äù reviews, this is like Moss only in the basic concept where you‚Äôre a godlike being guiding someone else through an adventure. The gameplay is much, much more challenging than Moss. In battle you guide the character around with the left thumb stick, fight with A and B buttons, gather resources to mix spells from the environment with your left hand, and choose and cast spells with your right. Doing all this while under attack from all sides and above is far more difficult than anything in Moss except maybe for Moss‚Äôs final bosses. There‚Äôs no healing by grabbing the character either like you can in Moss. You heal by first casting a spell on an enemy, then if you defeat it before the spell wears off, you‚Äôll regain a bit of health. In my first few hours of gameplay combat has been what I‚Äôve been doing the most. I can‚Äôt even imagine how difficult the bosses will become later. I‚Äôve only encountered one so far, and they unleash that on you at the end of the tutorial level. Unlike Moss, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any puzzles in the game so far, just basic platforming in between a lot of combat, so if your favorite part of Moss was solving puzzles, you may be disappointed with Mixture. If your favorite part of Moss was the combat, but you wish it had been more of a challenge, then you should really enjoy Mixture. The environments, character designs, and animations are well executed, everything runs smoothly, and the controls are precise and responsive. To lessen the difficulty slightly, (but not by much), you can enable auto aim for spell casting. The one bug I encountered is that if you enable auto aim from the pause menu within the game it doesn‚Äôt target enemies. If you enable it from the main menu it works fine. If this game had multiple difficulty levels it would easily be a four or five star game that I could recommend to almost anyone. As it is now, it‚Äôs a niche game that‚Äôs strictly for hardcore gamers. I sorta like the challenge, but without the puzzle elements to provide a break between the frequent combat sequences after several hours of playing it‚Äôs starting to feel repetitive and more like work than play. I‚Äôm no longer excited to play it when I put on the headset, but I‚Äôm going to keep at it for a while to see if it becomes more interesting. (Full disclosure, I was given a key to this game.)","The devs knew that they wanted something unique and fun when making this. The puzzles are great and you get to be an alchemist throwing vials at enemies. If you ever had chemistry class and felt the urge to throw chems around, this is your opportunity!"
