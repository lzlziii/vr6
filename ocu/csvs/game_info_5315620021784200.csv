Bounce Shot,"Bounce Shot is the family-friendly version of the popular college game! Players take turns attempting to throw ping pong balls into their opponent’s cups, making them disappear. The first player or team to remove all their opponent’s cups wins. But there’s a twist… Bounce shots can remove two cups in one go, but also allow the defending player the chance to swat the ball away. From the same folks who brought you the critically-acclaimed, Eleven Table Tennis, this game is simple to learn but deceptively challenging to master. Use the motion controllers to adjust the speed and angle of your throw to outthink and bluff your opponent. And trust us on this one… that delicious chime in your brain when you sink a perfect arcing shot into an opponent’s cup NEVER gets old. Bounce Shot is a game suitable for all ages and skill levels, even those who are brand-new to VR. Want your grandparents (or your grandchildren) to have their first crack at virtual reality? This is the perfect game to introduce them to the experience. Bounce Shot features include: - 3 stunning play environments w/original music - Practice mode for perfecting your play - AI opponents of 5 different skill levels - Private rooms for you and up to 7 friends - 1v1, 2v2 or 1v2 multiplayer matches - More game modes to come soon…",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Casual, Social",English,0.0.73,For Fun Labs,For Fun Labs,https://www.bounceshot.com/,"May 5, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5315620021784200/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5315620021784200&r=1, https://www.bounceshot.com/privacy-policy",437.6 MB,"Bounce Shot has its hooks in me…this is the perfect game to jump into any time to unwind and have fun. There is something so satisfying about the gameplay loop, and I feel like the devs really nailed both the physics and feel of shooting a “pong ball”. After playing Eleven VR’s ping pong game, I thought I was going to have to worry about tennis elbow, now I’m wondering if I’ll end up with bounce shot elbow…ok now back to the table!","This game is a lot of fun with other human players. The game makes it easy to find new people to play against. User interface while finding a lobby and navigating menus is done really well. The different lobby areas have their own unique environments. My favorite was the arcade room because you can shoot hoops/play air hockey while waiting for a table to open up. Starting a game is easy to do, just stand in front of one of the sides of the table. It guides you through what to do next in order to get started. The controls are pretty self explanatory, however perfecting them is some what of a challenge. The learning curve takes about 30 minutes of playing to get it right. The issue is with the tracking on the quest controller itself, not with the game. Sometimes it’s a bit frustrating finding the right release of the trigger button to control where your ball is being thrown. Playing against the AI (computer players) is what you’d expect. They will often miss on purpose until you make a shot into the cup, then they will come back and score a cup or two on you. I have found that they rarely successfully block a bounce shot. Overall this game is fun to hop in and out of, but lacks new content to keep you hooked for longer periods of time. It’s beer pong for VR, and that’s exactly what to expect.","This game would be alot of fun with friends but I really wouldn't see myself joining a public match. The gameplay physics played very well and environments looked reall good and unique, I especially liked the arcade room because there were a few interactive games you could play to pass some time. A few things I didn't like was the movement speed was really slow and there was very loud footstep sounds, also in the tournament looking room there is a very bad echo, maybe intentional as it is a big open room and it made it sound like you were in a big open room but the echo sound would make me not want to play in that room, the placement of the hand menu button needs to be moved I kept accidentally hitting it when swatting balls away and the menu would pop up in my face making me miss.",Welcome to the party! This game brings you back to the old days playing cup pong in hs and college. The controls are easy to figure out and you get the hang of the throwing mechanics pretty quick. Needs a few quality of life improvements like with movement. I love the arcade games just wish they kept score. You will have a blast with friends or randoms you meet in game.,"I was never a ""beer pong"" guru in my college days, but this was good fun. I think this will definitely be a hit as a social interaction game with friends. The gameplay and AI were pretty good, although I wish the ball released a bit earlier/didn't line up with my expectation of speed and angle... but that is the case with just about any object throwing in VR. I like the reracking of the cups as well! Definitely some quality of life/movement improvements that could be made, but all around a solid game that knows exactly what it is and what is doing."
