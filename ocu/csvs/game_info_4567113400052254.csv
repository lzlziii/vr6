But wow! Very, very impressed by what this has to offer already. I believe I counted nine 'worlds', not including the initial space ship and they're all just lovely. What I especially like about this app is that you can simply sit in a world and enjoy it. You're not pressured to meditate until you're ready. It's my only criticism of Tripp, which doesn't allow you to linger if you're not actively meditating. InnerVR allows you to take your time, explore a bit if you like, sit and contemplate your surroundings or your own thoughts, and then start a meditation when you're ready. I also very much appreciate that the worlds are unlocked after you do the first meditation. There is at least one more world I need to unlock but I'll get to it on my own time. An app like this satisfies my original desire for VR: to immerse myself in a different reality without gaming or fighting while there. Thank you for creating this. I hope more worlds are on the horizon, but I'm also content with what you've created already.","The surroundings are beautiful and I really enjoyed the lantern lighting experience. I find somethings distracting like the jumping whale is more comical than soothing. Starting off in the spaceship which I don't have an issue with however feels a bit too cartoony/childish but is a small thing. Also dropping the orbs into the fire isn't easy and you can still see the orbs after dropping them in. Would be good if they disappeared. I also find navigating the controls to go somewhere or do something can be a little laggy. Again these are all small areas that could be improved, I do really enjoy the sessions and the beautiful worlds that have been created. Well done","Great meditation app! I actually like it better than Tripp, Meditation VR, Maluka and other meditation apps on the Meta Quest store! The environments are beautiful and immersive. I love how I can just hang out in the different environments without even having to meditate. This app makes me feel very calm and relaxed and helps me to de-stress from work everyday. Thanks creators for developing such a wonderful app!","An app made with love and wisdom. I have tried many meditation apps, but only this one really touches me and works for me. I am learning to live with a lot of physical pain in my body and work-related stress. This app really helps me with that. Beautiful environments, the music, the voice, the meditations, everything testifies to the love and devotion behind this app. Many thanks to the developer(s)!","This is my fav meditation app in VR. Thereâ€™s a nice collection of scenes (I like the beach, the Japanese garden and the forest) each with their own guided meditation and relaxing soundscapes. Plus you get to do little activities such as lighting floating lanterns and feeding deer. Highly recommended!"
