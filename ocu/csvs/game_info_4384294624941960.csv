Match It,"Floating through the vastness of space, Dark Metropolis is one of the many doors where space and time diverge. A threshold in which distance is irrelevant and years can become nanoseconds. Not only has this floating city been abandoned by its creators, but the key to the door can only be opened by those that possess the ability to defy time, find the complex patterns, and successfully break through the puzzles which secure its power. You, the lonesome explorer, have discovered this ancient relic through your analysis of the echoes it creates. Like ripples in water, your journey to find the center of the disturbance has led you here. You now have the opportunity to unlock its secrets and become the greatest adventurer of all time.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Casual, Puzzle",English,"0.1.15

Could use a few fine tuning points though. (It's possible some of the following have in-game fixes, but I couldn't figure them out.) There didn't seem to be a way to re-center the view, and the menu loaded up behind me when first starting the game. Having some sort of visual indicator to direct me to the menu (or to have it load properly in front) would be helpful. Seemed to be some music playing in the background, but it was super quiet. If there would have been a way to turn up the music and/or turn down the sound effects, that's a welcome addition. Having a star ranking system instead of a flat clear time would be helpful for some of the harder levels. This would let people clear a level ""slower"" for say, 1 star, and then come back to try again for 3 stars. The clear times also didn't seem to match with how easily I was clearing levels. Some I blasted through without ever hearing the countdown start clicking, while on others I had made it only halfway through before the countdown started. Perhaps averaging clear times from other users could help make the experience smoother.","The campaign is too hard. I can't make it past one of the first levels. There must be a secret control method to beat a level that I don't know about yet because it's virtually impossible to beat the clock on one of the first levels. Arcade was more my bag, although when you get a high score, it doesn't put your name on the leaderboard which is annoying. I don't know which is my score on the leaderboard. Other than that, there's nice music and it's a fun idea for a puzzle game for a cheap price, but this needs a tutorial because...... 1) I had no idea of the controls to start off with and... 2) If there's other tricks that I should know to beat the early hard level, then a tutorial would help."
