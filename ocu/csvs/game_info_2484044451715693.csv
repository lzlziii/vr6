What first stands out in this game is the choice of music. There are now plenty of tracks, and each comes with 3 difficulties + cardio, each is good, each is fun to dance to; solid driving beat, good pump up vibes. Usually in these games I only really like ~1/5 of the songs and put up with the rest. It comes down to taste, but for me most of them work great! The other thing that stands out is the choreography. It feels very carefully thought out. I'm not just trying to flail to touch everything like a space shooter game, I'm doing *moves* and the gems really snap to the beat. The first time I played it, I giggled out loud (while alone) when I realized one of the moves it was making me do. This is in stark contrast to Synth Riders (demo), where the movement feels only loosely correlated with the beat. Basically, if you like the tracks, this is a no-brainer. Just get it. Keep sending us the funk! Love the Gangnam update. :) Great game!!! For reduced price on this and other titles, see my username. Remember you can return a title within two weeks or two hours play time a few times a month. Hope this helps!","What an awesome dance game. As an original South Florida Raver I will say this game is dope af!! I love the music and look forward to more music being added. Its a great way to stay in shape or get moving and burn calories. The game makes me want to dance harder so the workout is awesome. I do only play in beginner mode so far...I feel the dancing is better in this mode and more of what I'm looking for. The regular mode seemed the movements were too fast...maybe its just me being use to beginner mode but again for body movement dancing, beginner mode seemed to flow better for me. Im not giving up in the higher levels though. Just my experience so far. I love this game so much! Please put more music into soon!","What a brilliant game! I loved the old school dance mat but disliked just dance, saw this and gave it a shot, what do you know... It's the most played game on the quest for our house! Great songs, better known than beatsaber etc and so much movement required to use it makes sure you get a proper workout. We love the modes (cardio, freeplay, difficulty levels etc) and everyone loves it.","I've bought both games and this is better for workout, levels are better designed, require more movement and are more attractive visually. What is really cool is that it can do amazing stuff with the audio, you can even adjust pitch of songs in order to practice them. I also like the campaign mode","I love the game play. Can't complain about it at all. I bought to add a little cardio to my otherwise sedentary day. I'm over 50. It gets me moving, and almost sweating. However the songs aren't long enough to really get an elevated heart rate. There's just too much cool down between songs. I wish there was a way to make a playlist of songs I like and then have them play seamlessly back to back. That's all it needs for a 5!"
