I want to say thank you for all the devs and people who put their effort on making something like this app. I‚Äôm a software engineer and I‚Äôm impressed how far VR has gone and how good this app is.,"I do cardio on VR 2x a week after doing 30-40min of Calisthenics in my living room. Usually a do 10min of thrill of the fight, 15-20min crazy kung fu at level 15 and then another 20ish min on les mills.. The game/train forces repetitions and long sessions programs . You can choose upper body, full body, legs ‚Ä¶ I dropped 8 kilos last 3 months and I‚Äôm back to my regular weight. I cut lot of carbs out of my diet . Except beer, beer is the best carb a man may have :) I‚Äôm 44","I absolutely love this app. It is a great workout and I can choose short, medium and long workouts. I can also choose the intensity and there is plenty of workouts to choose from. This game is amazing and worth every penny. This is great for fitness and losing weight. This is also great for people who have a busy schedule and little time for fitness.",Great motivational app around boxing. Loads of workouts to choose from from light to intense workouts which now include a warmup session before the main workout. I haven't used it as much as I should and need to start to build up but I find the trainers really motivational. Definitely worth it if you want to have a workout.,"Price: $25 ONE TIME. That is the main reason I chose this out of all the other workout apps. You end up paying too much for the others. Yes, it has less songs and its very simple. But for the price you CAN NOT beat it! Who needs all the hoopla? Your trainer probably would do the same music over again with the same routines. How much do you really need? Variety: There are about 50 or more workouts. (I have no idea, but there are plenty!) They are all categorized under beginner, advanced, etc and you dont have to struggle to find them. Ease of use: There is one main screen during your workout and another to view your progress. You can see all of your stats in one area! You dont have to click a million links to see your calories burned for the day! I love that its simple. Music: There are no music choices. The music comes with the workout. However, it is VERY motivating! Afterall, you dont really get to pay attention to the music. Heres why...... Trainers: The trainers are fantastic for the price you pay! They are very motivational! They push you and talk to amp you up while you are working out! Summary: I dont need a million bells and whistles to workout. The fancy-pants apps add stuff you dont need so they can charge more. This is enough. Its all you need! I LOVE THIS APP!!!!"
