I tried Arkio and it's not too hard to use when you understand the idea of pushing in/out shapes. Unfortunately, there is no mass selection method because Arkio thinks that you will want to only move child items of a parent which is far from always being the case. I created each step of stairs and wanted to copy these steps elsewhere. Couldn't. It will also glue the child to its parent meaning that if my wall is on the floor and I wish to extend that floor to add another room, I can't because stretching the floor will automatically stretch/move the wall on it. There is also the lack of moving an object on a specific axis. They talk about grid snapping which works if you're very close to another object but it isn't always the case. Finally, as I was working on my little project, something went wrong and I couldn't undo anymore. I went in history and couldn't restore. I gave up.","Not an architect, but I love designing in SketchUp. Arkio is an excellent tool to import my designs into a real urban environment. Love the feature of looking up a location anywhere in the world, get a street map, enable the option to see existing buildings at that location in 3D and view from street level, bird-eye view, and from inside buildings out etc etc. Experiencing a site/design from within VR is really immersive. Sending it to all my architect friends.","Hey so the app is amazing, i have no complaints as for the app, but i recently imported 3d renders into the app and it worked sucessfully. Now the problem is that I imported too many renders and the app crashed every time I opened it. So I went to my import files on my computer and I deleted them. now that was a mistake because I tried to uninstall the app and reinstall but it reinstalled exactly how I uninstalled the app and the files are still not there so I understand that this is an oculus problem and not the apps so if anyone can help me I would exponentially appreciate it.ï¿¼",Favorite thing ever,I entered my license key wrong and cannot delete it anymore on Arkio. I could not log in because of it. I tried to delete the Arkio app to download it again through oculus app as well.
