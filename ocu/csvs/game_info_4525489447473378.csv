SHIPS,"Aspiring to create a unique yet simple concept in VR, Utopia Immersive designed boat locomotion with an emphasis on leisure and environment immersion. SHIPS(as of September 2021) features 7 ships, 2 docks(maps), 21 customizable ship colorways, 3 hours of varied music genres, and sitting or standing preferences. To prevent discomfort or confusion regularly attributed to Virtual Reality, the design of ships accomplished only using two buttons on each controller(grab and trigger). This design guarantees that the boat movement is successful in preventing unwanted motion sickness and excessive control related confusion. The potential of SHIPS is far beyond what is shown in this build. With time, honest reviews, and increased exposure, SHIPS will look to include more ships, larger/more docks, multiplayer modes, racing, and so much more.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Relaxation/Meditation, Simulation, Travel",English,2,Utopia Immersive,Utopia Immersive,https://utopiaimmersive.notion.site/Utopia-Immersive-9fe74dbd835f4b39afd0bbd2c4dd314e,"Oct 20, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4525489447473378/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4525489447473378&r=1, https://utopiaimmersive.notion.site/1f26681ad49f45edaa6e790af9af360b",533.1 MB,Maybe some better physics with the tilting of the boats and some graphical tweaks this game should break the record,If you hit a ice burg your ship will slowly sink and new ships bigger map and please add multiplayer,"Thanks for this nice idea. Love it so far. Some suggestions: * Bigger map - so you can go further with your ships * more realistic physics: When stopping, the ship should glide. Fo a faster stop, you should take the reverse gear * More realistic physics: Especially at a small bat: When you move to the left side, it should tilt left a bit. Same to the right * A larger map would be fine. Maybe even a realistic one by using google maps/earth * Croation harbour would be nice Thanks & best wishes, Christoph",Oh my how amazingly enjoyable is this i love the simple graphics to me that is whst vr is about is about not representing the normal world a complete departure and in this game or experience i felt truly involved and i loved the choice of vessels i personally liked the sail boat in pink. Well done developers. You dont have to kill things. To Feel the vr experience. Anyway happy sailing x,"Summary: Great game. Cannot wait to see the final product Positive: - multiple ships - good tutorial Negative: - low graphics (e.g. no wave, only during the day, no fish, no bird, etc...) - simplistic control of the ships (please make them more realistic) - could not figure out how to activate the radio (to listen to music) - no option to turn off the sound of the motor to listen to the nature"
