But it does have one good saving quality, it holds 4 year olds attentions for longer than 3 minutes…","A basic children-pixart guitar hero with 5 songs. This is free so only I can say thanks. If that had more songs, modes and more damage for enemies when you play well or something.. have potencial for being better. Now is like an early beta game.","Decent concept done really terribly. Out of sync notes, terrible graphics, deafining audio, the works. A game very similar but done more refined is smash drums, also available through app lab. I think this game has alot of potential and it does seem that with a lot of refining and tweaking this game could come out really fun, but it's not quite ready yet.","I don't know why i left the review originally but most of my complaints are gone, it's clear to see if you hit the notes now, it brings me back to my very vague memories of playing rock band, this game is delightful and i'm gonna probably learn how to get better at it, it's amazing that the devs are listening to feedback and making the game better!","This is a really neat rhythm game idea, but hot dang man ya gotta at the very least sync the notes up with the music. They always come WAY too early, where honestly my first playthrough I thought you were just throwing random notes at me and they had nothing to do with the music."
