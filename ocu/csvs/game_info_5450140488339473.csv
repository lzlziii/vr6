Your game is very great. I‚Äôve been playing since your game had a woman that‚Äôs the player and instead of Greg or Bob, you had just a crash dummy my recommendation is that you add animals such as dogs, cats and apes and a thing called the time machine where you can travel back to old versions. The only reason I‚Äôm writing this is because I‚Äôm actually friends with you ever since I made a video about one of your older. Npcs Do we need some kind of filter where it shows your future child, please add these things",the update isn‚Äôt here yet but that‚Äôs for pcvr only like why no multiplayer and updates it might be fun at all spawning more npcs but spawning more npcs might lagg your game lagg your game how you gonna play games that are fun just uninstall the game cause it doesn‚Äôt have updates and go play big scary it has a horror and levels and nope but there‚Äôs no nope yet mabe he might make mod website please project third eye you need to release the update and multiplayer it might be fun but it isn‚Äôt for quest,It has so many different vehicles!
