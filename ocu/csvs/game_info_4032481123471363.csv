Please update Air Brigade 2 to reflect the scenery of Air Brigade 1.","I have no issue with motion sickness at all and have played vr for 2 year. Had to stop after 5 minutes of this. Controls bad, view bad. I know is in development but I'm going to ask for a refund","I’ve been playing flight sims for almost 30 yrs now. All the way back to F-15, on a floppy disc on a Tandy computer, and Chuck Yeager on a 386. I’ve been waiting for the day when VR was good enough for enjoyable flying experiences. It is now! I’m really enjoying this game. The textures could be a little nicer, but at this stage, it’s still really good, and I know it’s only gonna get better. Love the flight characteristics, very quick and smooth response. I was instantly immersed in the experience. Even had that butterfly stomach on some of the aerobatics. Great job and Thank You to all the people who developed this one!"
