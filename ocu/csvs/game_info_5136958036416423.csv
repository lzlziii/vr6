The game isnâ€™t physics based, but thereâ€™s no wiggle sword fighting either, because it wonâ€™t get you anywhere. You have to be strategic and utilize abilities that your fighter has to best your opponents. But you donâ€™t need any buttons to use them. The only button you use is your grip. Thatâ€™s because you need to make poses and gestures to activate abilities and buffs. It does take a while to get used to, but that doesnâ€™t change the fact that this isnâ€™t the most fun addictive game out there! Great game!",This is my honest opinion. I love this game I think it is very unique and different with how the game works and the classes. My one problem is that as of recently my game crashes and I have to either quit out the game or I have to turn off my oculus. In the middle of a fight id freeze then Iâ€™d have to quit the game losing my ranked points saying I gave up the match when I really didnâ€™t. I love this game and wish I can play it more but there are just freezes that make the game hard to play and enjoy.,"I love that everything you do is based on your actual movement. You truly have to master striking the different poses and swing style of the class you want to play to be most effective. And you are free to move about within a set play space. You can get as physically active as you want dancing about with the faster classes or take it slow and methodical with the slower ones. There is some artificial movement with players getting pulled towards each other in order to force engagement, but it's brilliantly done.It appears that just your opponent is moving towards you since your view of the background remains locked to this movement. So no motion sickness for ppl who are susceptible. I was surprised the Quest version does not run at 90 fps like the steam version. It didn't make a big difference and I'm sure there was a reason this concession had to be made.",Theres a lot i want to say about this game so im gunna use a list in no particular order The Good stuff -Motion Controls Theres very little buttons used even in menus always feels great -Variety Theres 8 ish classes all unique with distinct play styles and fun even with player within the same class everyone fights differently and thats half the fun of multiplayer -The Style: The art style is the most eye catching thing about this game and for good reason all the environments look great and fit their class perfectly the classes and weapons also look great which is nice as its the main thing your gunna be looking at -Fast matches: Getting into matches is always quick and im surprised if it takes longer than a minute they are also very nicely paced not being to long or short -Lots and lots of depth: All the abilityâ€™s and different weapons combined with the different classes on top of all the tricks and maneuvers you can pull make a game that even hours upon hours into is still engaging and interesting -Music: The music is fantastic and gets you in the perfect mood for some stabbing fits great with the environments also its adaptive because of course it is -Easy to learn: While it does take some time to get used to theres a dojo to learn any class you want along with fundamentals and a training mode in the dojo and while waiting in between matches also no annoying tutorial if you donâ€™t want it Bad stuff -Lag can be a little annoying: It rarely if ever gets in the way of me enjoying the game and my WiFi hates the quest so it should be fine for you just be aware -Solo mode is not great: Doesnâ€™t matter too much as no matter how good the solo mode is multiplayer would still outshine it and it does have some value just starting out and for practice Stuff you should know -Very sweaty: Not much to say your gunna sweat -Not physics based: This goes well with the game and never is a problem but be aware of it this isnâ€™t bone lab Thats it for now i might add some stuff later I definitely recommend it worth the price and if you donâ€™t like it the return policy on quest is pretty nice,"Getting this game at the start was ruffâ€¦ my game kept crashing, it was annoying trying to learn because of it but all of a sudden it stopped crashing and I started clapping kids over and over ðŸ’€ðŸ‘Œ itâ€™s really funny watching kids take this game seriously and bow and shi and take a stance thatâ€™s really over dramatic then get demolished 2 seconds later. This game is 10$ super cheap for a hell of a time playing it and how the visuals look ðŸ˜‚ 10/10 would recommend."
