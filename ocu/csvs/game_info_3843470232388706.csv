BangSquash PRO,"BangSquash is a block breaker-style for Oculus virtual reality (VR) platform which could be attractive for people of all ages. We believe Bang Squash to be an ideal game to show off the basic operation of the Oculus platform to novice players, or to get in a mini workout session in a couple of minutes. It is an arcade game, so each level could be repeatable many times and there arenâ€™t two similar scenarios regarding the playing of levels, everything happens differently each time because of the realistic physics. The game launch with a whole set of fun achievements and a global ranking system to increase replayability. !!!Orientation-tracked controller is required to paly this game.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Music & Rhythm",English,2.2,Leber software,Leber Software,https://lebersoftware.hu/bang-squash/,"Jun 16, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3843470232388706/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3843470232388706&r=1, https://lebersoftware.hu/bangsquash-privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,182.3 MB
