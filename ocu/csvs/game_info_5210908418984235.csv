MageCosmos,"【Own An Island Here】 MageCosmos is an open world where your adventures are unlimited. Your incredible journey starts on a magical floating island with your own cozy house on it, like everybody else. Looking around, you will find neighbors living on the same island as you do. This is a HUGE world! 【Farm&Factory, Keep It Running】 Your life on the island depends pretty much on how you manage it. You have a big farm to grow various plants, feed animals, use your harvest to manufacture new items, and complete orders requested over the community to get huge amounts of MageCoins in return while having fun! 【Friends With Neighbors, Even Not With Real Human】 Speaking of that, friends are important or it'll be so lonely in such a big world, shake hands with whoever you meet to become friends with and send gifts to them. You can also use a small rocket, fly around and explore the islands. Some AI live there and they're desperate to meet visitors, ask them anything you want! 【Mini-Games And Worlds】 As is implied in the name ""Cosmos"", we are creating diverse styles of worlds to travel across, and party games for you and your friends to play together...It's going to be fun!",12+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Casual, Simulation, Social",English,0.5.2,Zaidengdeng Holdings HK Limited,Zaidengdeng Holdings HK Limited,https://magecosmos.live/,"Jun 11, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5210908418984235/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5210908418984235&r=1, https://www.magecosmos.live/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,1.65 GB,"When I saw the trailer for this game I wasn't sure about it, but I thought I would give it a try anyways.. Glad I didn't make the decision to bypass this one based on what I saw in the trailer. New to VR/Quest (just little over a month now), but this game is impressive. My only issue is that since this game just be launched for about 2 months, there are not so many players in it so sometimes I cannot complete the tasks. But I'm glad their developers are friendly and helpful, and they would like to play it with me. Can't wait to see the future development of this one!","On behalf of the MageCosmos team, we would like to express our deepest gratitude to all of our early players who have supported us throughout our journey in creating this VR social gaming platform.

Haven’t been able to find anyone playing on it. The one game I saw that was a castle defend type game was ok but buggy. Potential….Keep your eye on this.
