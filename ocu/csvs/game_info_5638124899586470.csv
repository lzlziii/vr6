I got all the way to the arcane expanse level 3 and I cannot progress any further. There's one section where you're supposed to do a double water bubble jump and then a triple water bubble jump to get up to the 3rd floor to get the silver key, and it's completely impossible. I have been trying this same exact jump for close to an hour now, hundreds of attempts, and I simply cannot get past that 3rd bubble and onto the 3rd floor. I'm essentially stuck, unable to progress because of 1 jump being like a nanometer out of reach. I really hope the devs address this because I was having an absolute blast with the game up until this point Edit: I found out that there are cheat codes available in the menu that help me bypass that level. It's nice that I'm not stuck anymore, but it doesn't help your case much when you NEED to use cheats to get past a section of the game. Flawed game design. Besides this the only other issue are some random glitches, no clipping out of the map, and various select areas that cause drops in frame rates. Still a very fun game with lots of fast paced action and shooting.","Worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (remove spaces and the comma is a dot): b i t , l y / e v i l v r Love this game. Lots of amazingly cool weapons. The retro graphics are gorgeous, the baddies are fun to kill and the levels are constantly scratching my exploration itch.","Kids will definitely have fun with this game. Playing the game feels like doom mixed with cheap knockoff movie swords and other weapons you'd find only at Dollar Tree or General. So instead of smacking your parents or siblings with a cheap knockoff weapon you can go wild on the variety of monsters they have in the game. Overall the game gets very repetitive as you go around finding keys to open doors while slaying enemies to get to the exit to fight a boss at the last level. Wish you could do more with the weapons such as upgrading them and make it do different things permantly instead of relying on a temporary power-up. Level designs are alright but I think the PC version has slightly better visuals and some levels seem to be weird where you have to rocket jump your way to get around, which rocket jumping is actually pretty fun in the game but I wish the game offered perks to our character such as double jump and such. In addition FPS can drop hard and map can become glitchy if you refuse to kill enemies and let a lot gather on you.","Aren't we all tired of quest games that are mostly just a proof of concept? I know I am tired of the endless onslaught of VR rougelikes that hide their lack of content with various tricks. Although I find some of them fun, I yearn for more games like Resident Evil 4, that were made on a different platform with a different design perspective. On pc and consoles CONTENT matters, LEVEL DESIGN matters. A game that takes 4 hours to complete, or a game where you've seen all there is in 2 hours just wouldn't sell. Unfortunately on quest they do. That's why I'm so happy that New Blood Interactive dropped a full fledged game, that is full of levels, weapons, difficulty, variety - everything that the usual quest games lack. Level design is phenomenal. It has the best music out of all retro shooters. Doom, quake - those games didn't have the epicness of what we can hear here. The weapons make use of motion controlls in a suprisingly fun way. *edit* Starting the game on ""hard"" and with ""warrior mode""(the way it's meant to be played) enabled is a must. BUY THE GAME so that they give us Ultrakill and Dusk. A lot hangs on how well this game sells and I have to tell you it's worth buying if you like single player FPP shooters. If you want to get it cheaper, here ocul dot us/3Ag0aeb","Pretty samey, very buggy, wouldn’t fly on a proper platform. Progression is confusing, possibly broken. At some point I’m brought back to a previously completed level, and I’m honestly not invested enough in this mess to figure out why. Another lazy ‘retro experience’ that isn’t good enough to call a full game. Dummies keep five-starring mediocre stuff like this and keeping the medium disappointing. Gotta get too close to dumb rune hints to get them to translate, so close that you can’t read the translations. That level of attention to detail explains all the other bugs you’ll endure trying to complete this lazy excuse for a game."
