I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Somehow, scanning groceries and targeting fruit uses different parts of my brain, so it's a challenge that also makes me laugh. The levels are fun, and the loudspeaker announcements are hilarious. The only complaint I have is that there doesn't seem to be a way to play this game while seated (everything is too low--below lap level). That means it's not accessible to certain players, which is unfortunate. Please either make (or fix) the seated scale gameplay so that those confined to wheelchairs can also play.","This is a genuinely great game and I love all the characters, levels, and weapons. And all for a great price. Definitely a buy üëç bit(dot)ly(slash)OculusDisc Replace (dot) with a period and (slash) with a slash.

Finally a shooter that's funny because you shoot at fruits and not at people. It's awesome that you also have to find the balance to scan the goods. And every round is just fun! With the juice won you can unlock new weapons. The game is just great!,Game is very exciting I love this game and I play it everyday at least twice. I‚Äôm locked in
