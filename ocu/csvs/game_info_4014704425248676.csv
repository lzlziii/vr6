For how good it is, and how much it offers, it‚Äôs a definite recommend. There is a variety of different types of meditations, meditation series, some with really great instructors, a garden/home environment you can design, and voice acting from the awesome Neil deGrasse Tyson. I mean, did I mention it‚Äôs free??? I would probably pay $10-$20 for this and still be pretty satisfied :). Thanks devs!","I love the beautiful kaleidoscopic graphics used in some of the meditations. They are so relaxing and calming. The Deepak Chopra meditations are WONDERFUL. I also love the stretching, which you earn access to by completing some meditations. I now have access to almost everything, and it's amazing that it's all free. I hope this excellent, high-quality content continues to be available, because I love it so much. It takes a little time to figure out how to navigate, but no worse than TRIPP, which now costs a fortune for content that is not any better.",They are discontinuing this app! Years of building a meditative garden gone!! üò≠üò≠üò≠ Edit! They are continuing! If they ask for money pay them! Don't let them die!,How it all started I found myself using daily skills that I enjoy in the world of MalokaÔøº in real life and I've noticed my strengths more each and every day by day Im must wil keep all i learned close to heart farwell my maloka spirit guided friends . P.s since the announcement of recent events pertaining this app is very hard to stay logged in once you log out it‚Äôs hard to get back in . -2‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è,I wasn't sure what I thought of this game at first. Now that I have unlocked more. I really enjoy it. It is visually stunning. I'm still exploring what is available but I hope to find more guided movement exercises. Sometimes I go to the purple floating puddle surrounded by what looks like northern lights just to chill and listen to the sounds or do to yoga. My job is stressful and this game has helped.
