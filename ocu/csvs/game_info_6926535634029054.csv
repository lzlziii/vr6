I set up my area. Walls, doors, light source, spawn points, base. Then save and enemy spawn never gets a green light. I'm following the tutorials but still must be missing something. I will update my review once I can actually play the game. I've tried on 3 different sessions to set up my play area. With no success. I belive this game would benefit from a more in depth tutorial.","I enjoyed playing this game and liked the zombie effects and gunplay. The setup took me some time to figure out, but overall great experience! Keep up the good work!"
