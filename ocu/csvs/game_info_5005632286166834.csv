The game has almost everything you need and multiplayer, there is only one mode I think they should add, creating your own shots and goals. I’ve seen the videos on YouTube that they make and it looks cool and would be awesome to save goals that the professionals couldn’t, once they do that, the game will be perfect and I will no longer ask for anything else (Also we should be able to play other people’s shots too) Thank you for reading and I hope this will be an update soon.","The Graphics, The contents, It is the best game iv’e tried so far absolutely LOVE IT! 5 star rewiew from me🔥🤩 BUT🍑 There is one thing u should add… and that is a mode where u can Create goals ur self😃, Iv’e seen the vids on yt and i think u should make it a public mode of creating ur own goals, Like you can go to a webside and Create your own goal and you get a code and Then you enter with the code in the game or smth☺️, But every other thing about the game is perfect👏🏻👍🏻",It’s fun to play and hard I recommend playing with a soft pillow or mattress or play outside it won’t work outside until like 6:30 because the sunlight but it’s still a great game to play also has multiplayer theirs a lot of kids though also please make creating own shots public,I can’t believe this is the best game I’ve played on vr there is no glitches no lagging and it’s the best goalkeeper game on oculus 😅😅😅😄😄😄👍👍👍☺️ hope you found this helpful,I reviewed 5 stars because the graphics the physics the modes and the players but the thing I want is a mode in set piece where you choose you type of set piece like free kicks penalties and add another where you practice your distribution It’s still a great game (scroll for bananas) No where near Keep going Almost there I lied about that :( 50% there Giggity CONGRATULATIONS 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 there fake Your still scrolling The ancient monkey said there’s a life supply of goalie gloves Oh yeah that monkeys bones are beneath me aren’t they Ig there not then I swear they were there though Here they are 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤 🧤
