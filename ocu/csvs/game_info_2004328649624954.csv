Also it freezes too often. The screen will turn into small square with black surrounding making it unplayable. I can go through a level or two, then ""black walls"" appear. I can't even exit the game and have to power off or restart the oculus.",There are very few problems with the game other than there being TOO much to do. It's also made by one dev (I think) sooo you guys complain too much.,"This game was so fun! It felt like I was riding a real roller coaster! The only problem was that there were a few glitches. Sometimes, when I’m in race mode, the track will disappear and I can’t tell where I’m going, leading me to crash. The wierd thing is that even after I crash, the track doesn’t reappear. It’s still gone. I end up having to restart my headset and go into the game again. It’s still a really fun game and this is the only glitch, so it still deserves the five stars I rated it.",Just purchased this and although it its fun to play it gave me some portal vives i do have one complaint graphics are not good at all and whats even worse is that it says its quest pro optimized but really its so blurry and text barely readable,Great game. Puzzling in this game is so cool is so cool. But i lost all my progress! Help
