Escape Room Online,"There is only one purpose, Open the door and escape! The cursed doll's room. Everything in the room is a hint. Like a tightly closed child's heart, this room is locked by itself and cannot be opened anymore. - How can I enjoy the game more fun? It's fun alone, but if you don't like the game being difficult or scary, invite a friend. Even difficult puzzles are overcome together by sharing each other's thoughts and putting their heads together through voice chat. Work with up to 4 people to find and solve hints! - I want to play a game with my friend! First of all, I am contacting a friend who will play with me after a long time. If the relationship is awkward, try [Buy for a friend]. Please tell your friend [room code] who bought the game after making the room. Friends who are invited as guests simply enter the room code and prepare. Done! Play the game [start] and enjoy room escape with your friends. - I want to play with my friends who live in other countries. It has been updated so that you can play with friends from other countries. Please enjoy! We look forward to your feedback. We will gradually improve our functions by collecting various opinions, and in the official version, we will visit you with more episodes.",16+,"Single User, Co-op","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Adventure, Horror, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China), Korean",1.0.0,Skonec Entertainment,Skonec Entertainment,http://www.skonec.com/,"May 22, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/9023860981020066/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=9023860981020066&r=1, https://vrsquare.skonec.com/privacy%20policy%20Skonec_01.htm",1.28 GB,Best $1.99 I’ve ever spent! We experienced no glitching or issues with playing multiplayer. We have a few hilarious and intense jump scares! We completed the room with only a few minutes to spare! Can’t wait for additional rooms!! Amazing graphics and overall quality! Great work guys!,"This might be the most well made co-op VR escape room games I've played so far and at $2, it's a steal (despite it being a little short in it's current state). Puzzles and game play are great. I'm really excited for them to release additional rooms. Highly recommended","So far I like it a lot, one room for the low price is great. But I'm either making a mistake or there's a glitch? The piece of paper for the blue key says SIDE + 1010 so I added 3071+1010=4081 and nothing happens. I tried reversing it, tried 3071, ect.. Am I missing something?",For this price is actually unbelivable. Most well spent money ever! One of the best escape room VR which actually can be played with friends. A BLAST! A MUST HAVE! Can't wait for more rooms! @Devs please add as fast as you can more rooms because I really can't wait!,"Fun and good game. Very happy for multiplayer, did it more fun. Hope so much for more of this."
