Combat needs a bit more of weight and feedback. In melee, you can just wiggle your sword like crazy and everything goes down fast. It doesn't need to be physical combat like Blade and Sorcery, but it would be great to have a system to avoid wiggling, like weapon speed or cooldown when doing damage. Bow is pretty nice, but hitboxes doesn't seem accurate (I see arrows flying straight through enemies with no damage, and if It does, I don't get any feedback). Overall, a nice RPG for those looking for Titan Quest or Diablo in VR.","Not fully sure what they are going for here. Feels kinda like a arpg like Diablo or titan quest. I like the dungeon crawler feeling here that's the reason I picked this one up. I've played several dungeon crawler rpg types like shadow legend, vengeful rites, karnage chronicles, the morrigan and ancient dungeons. This looked worth a try so I picked it up. I know this is an early release but it does need work. I enjoy the way it's going so far, but at this moment it's very repetitive. I can say I like the menus how it's like in a arpg. However pulling up the map would be nicer if it was just a single button press. It's nice having the hub world village and some npcs there. Right now though it's very limited. So far I have only been able to ""talk"" with 2 of the 3. Sound so far seems limited like not much as far as no background music, no sound when hitting monsters. Sorry but there's really almost no way of knowing you hit the monsters since there is no sound and your weapon passed right through them like they don't even exist. Granted sometimes the monsters flinch as your weapon passes through them. The dungeons are random and because of this in other titles some rooms will look the same. Here though, besides the size of rooms, every dungeon looks exactly the same. Same beige stone floors, walls and ceiling. No barrels, boxes, furniture or even corpses. While the skeleton models very in size and the way they look, they will repeat, so it's like your always fighting the same monster over and over. When monsters drop loot it's always the same orb. Would be nice if they actually looked like items. Found no treasure chests in the dungeons ether. The last thing I would mention is the interactions. Most of them are point and click, in a vr game that breaks some of the immersion. That reminded me, speaking of immersion, know matter the weapon you have equipped, you have a constant laser pointer out of the right hand. Stones of Harlath is $9.99 and is a good arcade action style rpg. This is $7.99 and seems to high in price for what it is. I wanted to like this more since I was looking for another good dungeon crawler to play, but after the first couple of dungeons, the repetitive game play, lack of story, interactions, sound, and variety, I didn't feel compelled to continue playing. I hope the developers can really grow this game because it appears to have good bones at this point.","This game has classic RPG vibes screaming from it. You start in a town, where you can store your loot, sell & buy new loot before each dungeon run. Each dungeon run made up of floors. You climb the floors until you reach and defeat the boss. During these runs, you will build XP to level up, find new and better gear to use or sell. After you finish a level of the dungeon, you will respawn back into the main world. Here you are safe to go through your new found loot, upgrade you equipment and stats or sell off what you don't want before the next run. You will find yourself replaying a few lower dungeon levels to get new gear and build up your stats before you are ready to take on the higher levels. This adds great replay to the game, and adds to that classic RPG feel. I really enjoyed grinding the dungeons to find better loot and level up. Brought me back to the 90s playing the classic RPG games. The combat feels good in the game. You have both ranged and melee combat. The weapons and shields feel like they make contact, and do not feel like pool noodles. You can hold out your melee weapon and watch the enemy walk into it and take damage. One thing the combat is missing though is some impact sound effects. This would really add to the immersion of the game, and add that extra touch to the combat system. The controls are easy and feel spot on. The inventory and gear system is simple on works great in VR. I had no problem moving around hordes of enemies and fighting at the same time. The world is very nice. The enemies look amazing, and give me 80s - 90s rock band feel to them. They are just sweet looking. The dungeons are large, but all look the same. They need some random items to be generated through out the levels to make them feel more then just a brick maze. Over all this was a great classic RPG dungeon crawler with a lot of potential too it. Has some spots that need polish, but all the fun RPG factors are there. Preview here, https://youtu.be/Grb9t19SNbk"
