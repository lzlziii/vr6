If you are considering purchasing this game (or others on Quest) click on my pic and then ‚Äúchat‚Äù to DM me as I can help reduce the price you pay. (See the end of my review for more help). I have loved this game from the first time I played it. I have played the whole game through as a single player - my was it a hard battle to beat. I died a lot and would not give up and the rewards were huge. This is a fun, demanding and exciting game. The mechanics are excellent and the graphics are neat. I found myself contorting myself within my guardian to avoid getting killed. The story is good and believable. In addition my friend and I play multiplayer regularly - we unwind at the end of the day in a big shootout. There are only 5 chapters for multiplayer (really wish there were more) but we keep coming back to beat our previous score. This is a great and immersive experience - I recommend it as one of the top 10 games I play regularly. I hope you enjoyed my review ‚Äì considering clicking the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù button! üëç All my links can also be found on - l i n k t r . e e / b l i s s 2 1 2 1 (just remove all the spaces).",If you like games that you don't have to move yourself while you're trying to shoot this will be the game for you. I absolutely love the game I only have one complaint but other than that I would give it a 4.5 Stars but it needs to provide more guns easily throughout the game because it does get harder and harder but it is absolutely the best game ever. I play this game solo but I also play with a friend of mine and we just have such a blast I love the game so much that I bought the game for her and she just absolutely loves this game and won't stop playing it. You must give it a try!,"I got the free trial, just to see if the game was for me, the minute the free trial ended I bought it, the game is just so much fun. I have a disability that makes some VR games hard for me to play but this game has a setting to help with motion sickness, which is a really nice touch. I just wanted to thank the developers. Keep up the great work.","(Edited review) Great game. Nothing to complain about now that intros can be skipped. Beginners can easily pick up and play this game easily. Once again, great game, and great price. (Original review) Need to be able to skip intros when you die. It gets pretty aggravating pretty quickly. Other than that, there is nothing to complain about with this game. Sure, there are little things that can be tweaked, but those little things still work as is. Too many people complain about the tiniest, minute, trivial little things, but you won't get that from me, because it's a GREAT game. Just let us skip intros, and I'm all good.","I've been completely addicted to this game for 3 months! It's given me an immense amount of pleasure and excitement and I love the multiplayer mode. 3 timelines with 15 campaigns each., 5 solo hordes and 5 multiplayer hordes each with 30 waves, means there's a lot of content. In the solo campaigns movement is automatic taking you to another static position from which to shoot the zombies. This minimises any chance of motion sickness. In the hordes you stay in one place through each wave. Part of the strategy is knowing which guns to hang on to for each zombie type. But this is fast-paced, arcade-style action and you'll die many times before you can complete each level. If you like fast paced, shooting zombie games, you will love this game."
