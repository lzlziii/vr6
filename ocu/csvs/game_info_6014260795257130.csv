I have a quest 2, with ample memory to spare and storage, all to run whatever I want to run; yet when it gets on Heartlands SOMETHING chugs it up or forces a crash it can only recognise as ‘low memory’. The response to check back in a few weeks to another reviewer also hasn’t helped. fix pls edit : I saw the very quick reply; which I think is a good sign. I have faith the developers are doing their best; even if I can’t play, I bumped up the stars to 4 because of this. Heartlands LOOKS good; it’s just sad I can’t experience it. Good luck.",I have the quest 2 an I have the same problem as the quest 1 where right after the cart I see the little orb if I do everything quick enough I can get to the point where I pick my turn option an it crashes saying not enough memory I see it working for quest 2 so I wondering if theres anything I can do other than trying a factory reset. game looks amazing an I really wanted to play especially when it opened just like an elder scrolls would I hope the new updates didn't render the quest 2 obsolete or something (amazing customer service deves are working hard are regularly active an not shy to respond an help people with any issues with there products),It’s early but the game has so much potential I like the way it plays and feels also the looting is not bad at all I like that you can search almost anything including bodies and can’t wait to explore the city,Promising but needs a lot of work.,"It says the full game but, I downloaded, played and out of bandit camp, rode horse cart to town, it showed the title, then credits to my surprise after credits it started right back at the beginning before bandit knock you out and put you in a prison cell. Sadly this is not the full game as advertised. Extremely disappointing. This game had so much potential. Sad"
