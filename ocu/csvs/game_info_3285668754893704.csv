Please give the option to turn down and/or off the music. I can barely hear the other player’s voice over the game music & sound effects. It’s really annoying!! Otherwise super fun!,"Carly and the Reaperman is a game like Moss, Mixture and Ven. Its a platformer where you control a character (Carly) like a classic platformer, but also interact with her in a God like former (Reaperman). The game has amazing camera controls and supports room scaling. You will never have a bad camera angle in this game, and you can explore and move around the worlds freely. The game is a lot of fun and reminds me of Mario, but you solve puzzles and help the character in a God like way get through the platforming levels. The controls are easy to master and you will be controlling Carly and interacting with the world like a pro. The game has over 50 levels of platforming fun to complete and a story to following along. If you enjoyed games like Moss, you have to try this gem out.","Sometimes this game is very hard and frustrating, but I loved it. Playing with a friend is very funny and a great experience",I bought this on oculus and unlike any other game I’ve ever bought they want me to buy it again to download it to my pc to play it on the oculus ???,"Good, nice, mmmhmmm, had fun. Nice job to whomever created the game. Don't listen to those bad reviews of those guys are just dicks"
