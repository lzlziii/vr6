To support the devs, i even brought that addon stadium, but dont play on it lol. The 3 issues i have are below, 4th is not really issue but needs an update. 1. Graphics are cartoonish, but its playable. 2. There is a weird issue sometimes where there is like a stuck helmet and bat while playing. Its a HUGE glitch and blocks the view to play properly and there is no way to clear that stuck helmet except restarting the game. 3 some updates cause the height alignment of the quest 2 to stop working and it makes the angle either too high or too low, have seen this few months back and can see it for the last 2 days now, so i guess its some bug in app versions. There is no fix for this issue and it also messes up the alignment of the whole quest 2 headset. The only solution is to restart the whole headset and the issue is back when i restart the game. 4. Some bowlers like robin king bowl very high bouncers and its not given wide or no ball even after multiple times, so that should be fixed If not for these 3 issues, its an excellent game and honestly i LOVE it.",My favourite game on meta quest.,Great new update and has lots of potential but I’m finding the game is freezing quite regularly whilst playing the ODI game. Players do not run after the ball and then freezes. Other errors occurring as well. Please get this sorted as it’s a real enjoyable game to play before the problems start,I have been playing this game consistently for months and I am yet to get bored of this. I only use oculus to play this game. It is a good game that tests how you can handle the pressure in the game. Few bugs need to be resolved for it to reach it’s peak form. Great job to the developers and the team behind this game.,"Would be a great fun game. But having issues with bats floating in the air, and not swinging as intended causing you to get out. Another issue, is with floor leveling issue. Bats dont touch the floor, you have to really bend down now.(this is a recent issue) Edit: Not having these issues with other games unsure how this would be headset related issue"
