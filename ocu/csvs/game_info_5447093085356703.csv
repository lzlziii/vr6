It was pretty fun and it’s so low quality non-laggy horror game which everyone should probably enjoy. It was fun. I enjoyed it but that made me sad why they discontinued it. They do need to make it a lot less darker in the menu so that I can see but it’s pretty fun￼ and I will recommend it,Guys ik that y'all are sad but don't be bc the cheese rooms 2 is gonna be on applab soon so be hyped for that instead of being sad bc it's discontinued,Hello creator of cheeserooms i really miss the old one the multiplayer mode and the robot mode so when are the cheeserooms 2 comming out
