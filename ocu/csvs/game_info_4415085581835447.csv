Space Bucket VR,"The epic tale of a hero, a bucket, and the vicious alien that tries to tear them apart. A receptacle-based love story for the ages in the grandest traditions of classic space opera and the tales of antiquity. You will laugh. You will cry. You will travel through vast stretches of space and time with a box on your head, a bucket in your hand, and a song in your heart. Embrace the future. Embrace your destiny. Embrace the bucket. Space Bucket. But in all seriousness, Space Bucket is a fun little arcade-style game where you run around catching stuff in a bucket while trying to avoid falling to your death. There's some grabby and throwy bits too, and we hope you enjoy it!",12+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade",English,1.0,Suspect Reality,Suspect Reality,https://www.suspectreality.com/SpaceBucketVR,"Jul 8, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4415085581835447/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4415085581835447&r=1, https://www.suspectreality.com/privacy-policy",174.6 MB,It has a decent sense of humor. There really isn’t any story it’s just a vr arcade game where you catch lasers in a bucket them fill the bucket with laser juice. That’s pretty much it I mean I don’t regret buying it. It’s only a dollar.,Update: ok so I was right this game is absolutely stupid and absolutely fun. It’s my bucket now bolt boy. I can’t believe I paid a dollar for this. I haven’t even played it yet. This looks stupid but also it looks kind of fun. Space bucket omfg seriously. I have to say though it’s a dollar and it’s called space bucket. I’d gladly pay a dollar for a stupid game as long as I can tell my friends I have (a) “Space Bucket” Once I play I’ll leave an actual review but I mean you got me to buy it on the name alone so good job.
