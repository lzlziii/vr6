Putting those aside I had pretty fun playing the little bit of story mode there was and then playing the mini games were great! The dark store actually scared me which is good because most horror games don't scare me, the inventory also needs a little work but I liked that there were different weapons to find and that all the doors and most drawers were searchable. I see this game becoming something great so I give it a 4/5"
