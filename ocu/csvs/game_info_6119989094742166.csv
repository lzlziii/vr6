There is more customization than any other tennis game, the ball does do a backspin when you want it to. (There is a certain way to do it to which I have not found except doing a slice on complete accident) and the tracking for the tennis racket without the whole real racket attachment is spot on.. now for quest 2 doesn‚Äôt have the best tracking. And yes it doesn‚Äôt track my swing every now and then but it happens quite rarely. Everyone who wants a tennis game and a fair game, get this one. Developer if you are reading this. Keep updating this game. Keep making progress. Make more announcements for the overcome person says besides, ‚Äúlet the racket do the work for him‚Äù I love this game to death. It makes me love tennis all over again :) great game developer. You are absolutely fantastic!",Seriously one of the most important updates beyond just the amazing improvements to the physics. Passthrough mode lets me play with confidence knowing i wont smash my hand against the wall or furnitures around me :) really improved the playability of this gameüìÄ super sample up and go up to 120 hertz is a breath of fresh air now I‚Äôm ready to play my man online lol .. gotta say the developer has done a great job and look forward to more new things he puts out .. I know my oldest son would luv this he used to play in real life tournys‚Ä¶ this is best tennis app so far out there,"I have played this for several months and I am impressed with how real it feels. The ball goes in the direction I am aiming at and with the spin I intend. I noticed that all the problems I have in real tennis, are the same in this app. I am not a fan of the live feature, as it feels clunky and doesn‚Äôt work as well as the AI version. One complaint (maybe?) is that,even at the highest level, the AI makes too many mistakes. I haven‚Äôt lost a set in months, so I would like it to be more competitive. That‚Äôs said, I highly recommend this app. As a side, it also has helped me to lose weight. I get my heart rate up about 40 points during my workout. I also wanted to add that it is so accurate, that I can ‚Äúcatch ‚Äú the ball with my racket watch it balance on the racket while seeing the shadow of the ball on the ground. Incredible!","There are various vr Tennis games available now (thankfully), each one differs a bit in its approach and features. FPT Version 4.2 for me is still the most complete overall. Mainly because of its most advanced autorun and the online mode with Rankings, most of the Times there is someone online to play against. The discord channel is very well maintained by the developer mikori, he is reachable every Day or within hours and helpful if something is not clear to the user. The frequency of Updates and new features is also the highest under all Tennis games i own. That said, after the Release of a new live Version the development of the next Version is directly started in a beta everyone can join, test and give Feedback. Latest new features for example were the hawkeye, a spectator app so you could watch games from your Computer without the oculus and always little tweaks to make the gameplay more realistic. There are more new features announced like, a more complex and customizable ball machine (currently very basic), a virtual hitting Partner or an AI Pro Modus, as some users found the current AI too easy (which i agree too, but tbh, the AI is already the most advanced from all other Tennis games i have seen) Most Important here is that the developer doesnt only talk and promises, he delivers constantly over time, progress never stopped so far. There is an arcade Mode for beginners and a more challenging sim Mode with less assisted shots. I would classify the sim Mode not as a true sim, but 'simcade'. The better players play with a Speed of ATP pros, the autorun makes it possible to play and have rallyies as the pros. The game contains a Portal Mode and a full pathrough Mode. In theory, if you would have the safe space, you could completely run on your own on a virtual Tennis court. Most people of course dont have that and use autorun to be moved to the balls. Overall the most advanced and complete vr Tennis game on the store, a must buy for Tennis Fans with an oculus","This game has greatly improved my health, energy, and happiness! I play it first thing in the morning, multiple times during the day, and right before bed. The pass-through feature on my Quest 2 headset makes it feel like I'm in a real full-scale playing field. I can't wait for the full color pass-through that's coming with the upcoming Quest 3. Five stars doesn't seem adequate - this game deserves six stars or more! Huge kudos to the developers at Mikori Games! Please keep releasing updates and continuing the great work!"
