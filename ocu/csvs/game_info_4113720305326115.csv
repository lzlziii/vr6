Keep it up, pals! UPDATE Love the New Tropical course! Can't wait to play back nine. :) -- Although we are both from Germany, I live in Denmark, while my older brother went as far as he could, to Namibia. We used to chat as often as we could, but this game keep us together by simply playing a few holes while drinking a helle. We both love this game, not only because it is technically and graphicaly amazing but also cause it keeps us together. Future is now! There are still small things to improve, but fortunately it looks there's a concerned team behind the game. Thank you, guys!","St Andrews is absolutely incredible and even better than I expected. It really is just like being there in person. Just a question though, is it possible to purchase this and Royal Liverpool outright? I used my remaining coins to get St Andrews and have now lost access to Royal Liverpool. I would much prefer an option to buy outright the courses I wish to play. Thanks. I have been playing Golf 5 for over a year now and have watched it become more polished as the devs listened to and responded to user comments and suggestions over this time. I have been sometimes critical myself but only because I believe in this game and the potential it holds. This morning I purchased the long awaited Royal Liverpool course, aka Hoylake, the venue for the 2023 open golf championship and to put it bluntly I am utterly speechless ! What you have done here and the level of detail and accuracy is nothing short of mind blowing. To add to my shock you are soon to release the Old Course at St Andrews, where I live incidentally. Guys, seriously keep this up and you are onto a winner in fact a 'game changer' and I don't like to use that phrase lightly. Well done and I really mean that !!! Edit2: Still playing the game regularly and love it even better now. My issue with the putting has been resolved by deleting all game data and re-installing the game. My advice is get a club extender and spend time getting it dialled in to your actual swing. Once you get that it becomes more immersive and as I said initially it really is the next best thing to real golf in my opinion. Keep up the great work devs and perhaps you can tweak the game slightly to make full use of the additional Q2 horsepower after the recent V55 update ;-)","What upgrade!, what a real sensation is to walk through the buildings around the Old Course, and also the wind included! Thanks for listening our suggestions! Congratulations for this incredible golf simulator! It is so realistic, I completely forget about everything else! The putt is perfect, the swing too. But what I really like the most, is to play multiplayer with my best friends or family. After some weeks playing, I really like the multiplayer option!",Update: The Open in Hoylake is brilliant. You get to play The Open Course from the comfort of your own home. What an addition to the game. Fantastic game with some realistic ball flight (something that I've used to try to improve my game on the course). Really nice addition to bring the finale of the DP World Tour to the game. Looking forward to the future updates from the team.,"It is amazing, green speeds are perfect, not as fast as US greens. Love the drive on 17th “The Road Hole” and iconic drive on 18th. Cant wait to play with friends"
