Pixel Ripped is back with a brand new nostalgia-fueled virtual reality game-within-a-game, this time in the year 1995! To restore balance to multiple dimensions, our videogame hero Dot recruits the help of the best gamer from 1995, an unassuming 9-year-old boy named David. Join this unlikely duo through challenging throwbacks to all your favorite classics from the late 16-bit and early 32-bit era of games inside a virtual reality world.

You have to do all that and more through multiple environments - including your living room, bedroom, the local video rental store, the arcade at the pier, and more. Where each level feels like an entirely new game, Pixel Ripped 1995 is an incredible journey for both VR and retro gamers.

I can remember having the same fight over, which was better, Snes or Sega. I also remember a time when going to the video store for games was normal. The review part of this I can see each classic game that inspired each level. Like streets of rage, 2, castlevania, alien 3, and so on. I was not quite as sure with the 87 games, though. Donky Kong was all I could see. The games were true to the way things were back then, well, till dot messed with them anyway. This is a linear story from the perspective of David, and he likes his games. The game had just the right hardness and length. Yes, some of the levels were frustrating, like mom flipping the controller for the first quarter of the level, but it was not anything too difficult to get past. This game does have replay value. Like any good story, it's great to go back to. Also, there are all those gold cartridges to find. As for the Vr side of things. I thought it was well done. It's hard to get used to at first, but then it's fun having the blaster. The spit straw is a little slow to pick up. Still, this was a good game mechanic. The only complaint I would give is that I could not for the life of me figure a way to pause ether game or bring up a menu to exit out 87 once I beat it I had to just exit to the meta menu and go back in, but that is not a big deal. I can't wait to get 78 now that brings back memories. Thank you for the amazing ride, and keep up the great work. Quick edit I found the pause button and all the sub menus. I have no complaints except that hardcore superpuncher is really hard. I worked all day on it till I figured it out. You need her ripped move for the last fight, Clever.","I’m a 41 one year old life long gamer, started on 8bit. Lemme tell ya, this game is a punch right to the memories. The first level you’re sitting on the floor of your living room, at breakfast, gaming on an old crt, while your family “exists” around you. In level two, you’re at blockbuster video playing on two consoles, a Nintendo lookin one and a sega lookin one, back and forth between two games, while the store “exists” around you. I’m being intentionally vague, to avoid spoilers…but if you grew up with a Nintendo or super Nintendo, master system or genesis… Play this game. You’ll unlock childhood memories every step of the way.","I got this game as part of the first month of Meta Quest+ for a 1.06 USD and I was not expecting to love this one from the trailers. It just all clicks when you play it, and it was awesome! I was 2 in 1995, but a lot of the same feelings existed during my childhood too. This game was both heartwarming and nostalgic, I Highly recommend it. Don't judge a book by its cover VR games in general are so hard to read from trailers.","Warning: It is important to avoid Moloch worship and be cautious of satanic subliminal messages for the well-being of individuals and society. Moloch worship refers to the ancient practice of offering burning child sacrifices to a pagan deity. Engaging in such worship is not only morally reprehensible but also illegal in most jurisdictions due to its severe harm and violation of human rights. Subliminal messages, on the other hand, are hidden or disguised messages designed to influence individuals without their conscious awareness. While the impact and effectiveness of subliminal messages are debated, it is crucial to exercise caution. Subliminal messages can potentially manipulate thoughts, emotions, and behaviors without individuals realizing it, potentially compromising their autonomy and well-being. To safeguard oneself and others, it is advisable to stay informed and vigilant about any activities or messages promoting Moloch worship or containing subliminal content. Promoting a healthy and ethical environment means rejecting harmful practices and being aware of potential manipulative tactics that may undermine personal autonomy and psychological well-being.","Well made game, i can tell the deva put their heart and soul into it, but some of the levels, particularly the street fighter level on hard-core is simply luck based. There is no way to avoid being hit, no blocking just jumping around praying to any god you can think of. Difficulty is good in a game, but this was only frustrating. There was no complex mechanic to rememeber or perform, just the mindless clicking of two buttons and moving around a small room. Cant give more than 3 stars because of it."
