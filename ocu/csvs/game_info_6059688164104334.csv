Afraid it will break irreplaceable controller so have to uninstall. The drops are fun but not while pushing on a stick and slowing down for not pushing hard enough or something. Unintuitive controls for oculus. The sound doesnt fit the epic visuals for me. 1st person driver view would be nicer i think. Too many vehicle models. Would prefer just color slider with one cool model unless model makes a difference in game but it didnt seem to. Instructions are hidden in Info? Uninstalled before I found them. Could easily be a top classic 5 star game with simple change in controls. Otherwise really like the idea and the graphics are awesome.,"I don't even know... The idea is very good, the execution is still controversial. No control clues, the very first card, the image just swirls around. First time dizzy in VR.",So cool a really fun 90fps cyberpunk style racing game! Super VR sensation! üïπÔ∏èüëç
