It crashed the headset at first. Then throwing was impossibly difficult, with objects not releasing from our grip. Other objects glitched in and out of existence every half second. In a series of games one player got a zero score for every game despite clearly accomplishing the task. Things got stuck in world geometry. On and on. BUT Since then they’ve released at least two major bug fixes. We’ve encountered almost no bugs since then save for one crash for one player. Four rounds is sufficient for this kind of confectionary. Don’t do a full tournament or it will wear you down.","A fun game, but it would be much better if it allowed the players to select the games they wanted to play (similar to the Elven Assassin menu). The board game is nice but it commits you to playing the whole game with no choices of where to go. Free up the choices and the popularity will increase.",Hook Hog game crashes on table of trials and four round fury with no way out except to exit out of game,This game has a game breaking bug. The developer is impossible to get ahold of and this game has never been fixed. Shouldn't be on the service. Before this bug the game was highly recommended. *edit* The developer reached out. After working with them for a bit they have fixed the bug. I've now changed my review to reflect that this game is fun. 1 star removed for some balance issues in 4 player and janky physics with others. But note. This game is waaay more fun with family and friends.,"I have never finished a table of trials game while playing with my friends. Every time we play the game always freezes or crashes, especially for the pig hook minigame. It’s such a shame since we have so much fun and then the game stops working and it kills the vibe."
