When you are to tell an assistant something instead of pointing where they want you to I have to turn my back and wave my arms all around to get it done. I have done a skill over 10 times...16 min to go through it and can not complete the last step...very slim instructions on other things so you are basically just waving your hands all around to complete. My classmates and I have experienced pain and nausea from this and long behold....there are recalls for it. Sad unhappy buyer.
