PadelVR,"(THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE ALPHA VERSION). PadelVR is a Padel sport simulator in which you'll be able to learn, train and play Padel. This is an early version with just basic features and with an early physics engine that we are working on. What you will find in the first Alpha: ‚ñ™ Freeplay mode: try serving and hitting the ball alone on the court. ‚ñ™ Introduction: a sequence of shots with progressive difficulty from back and net positions. Ideal for getting started. ‚ñ™ Warm Up: a coach will throw random types of balls at you based on your position. ‚ñ™ Minigames: two short minigames to test your skills. ‚ñ™ What you should expect: Physics may not be as solid as desired. Note you have a physics tab where you can edit in game physics to tune your preferences like Bounciness, air friction, etc! Due to the lack of an adapter for your VR device, the hand movements and sensations may not feel realistic. We are working on a haptic adapter that will simulate the weight and the air friction of a real padel racket. You can also use your own custom 3D printed handle. Game modes have been reduced for the first alpha in order to get more streamlined feedback. Soon we will update it with extra features! Join our Discord Channel and give us your feedback! This is a testing version and should be used only for personal use.

Found out it late. I would prefer an auto teleportation as option. Thumb stick is Not my favorite in a fast game. In warm up mode high return balls disappear to fast before racket meets the ball. Physics Great!,"Definitely not ready for sale. The developers are open about the game being in Alpha status, so far, graphics look good. Playability issues with physics and ability to move around maintaining some level of control. A 360 degree ability to turn to see the ball behind to anticipate shots off the wall is needed. Don‚Äôt give up the effort.",Great job so farc‚Ä¶can‚Äôt wait for the Beta and official start of this great sport üëçüèº Thank you all,Good game so good just need to wait full vr,And we‚Äôll keep making it better‚Ä¶
