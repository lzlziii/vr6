Rocket Launch Films VR,"Experience real rocket launches up close like never before! Through the lens of our 3D VR cinema cameras, we take you to the launchpads of Cape Canaveral, Starbase, and more. See Falcon 9, Starship, Atlas V, SLS, Terran 1, Delta IV, and others, up close during liftoff and testing where no humans can be. Perfect for high-quality headphones (and haptic rumble suits), feel the Earth-shaking jolt of rockets like never before with professionally recorded ambisonic audio. Join our community on Discord and also go behind the scenes as we film new experiences and exciting spaceflight events.

Stereo 180 videos do an incredible job at giving you a sense of scale and perspective of how large these things are. In fact, VR is sort of the only way to get a real sense of their scale (apart from being there in person). They've also done a great job at the audio capture and mixing, giving you the ability to move your head and hear the things correctly spacialized. I highly recommend watching the ""Falcon Heavy Landing Experience"" with some headphones as well as the ""Cosmic Perspective VR Experience"". It's a kick in the teeth! PS - big thanks for allowing downloads of the videos (so you can watch them in high quality rather than depend on your internet connection bandwidth)","I've always liked Cosmic Perspective's YouTube channel and their super nice production quality. Then I found out they've got this app packed with awesome high-quality footage! The spatial audio really makes you feel like you're right there, and the rocket launches (and landings) are LOUD! If you're wearing headphones, check your volume. ðŸ˜‰ Space and rocket fans might spot some familiar faces and hear familiar voices, which is a fun bonus. I recommend buying this app and supporting the team on other platforms as well, so they can keep filming more of this epic stuff."
