I was happy once they released it and it is trash the old version was 10x better than this version. This game is for sure a waste of time and space on your oculus.,The old version was better,I used to be a moderator for this game kinda like how I was one of the creators for polar climb and the others didn't credit me for making the music besides that the older version of this game was more fun idk what culliswullis did but plz change it back,The colors are too bright and I can’t really see when I’m on a tree Maybe just turn the brightness a little down because then it will be easier for￼￼ people to see
