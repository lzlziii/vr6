If its this easy to ban people who have done nothing wrong then I would not recommend!!!",Its pay to win and it clearly says ‚Äúif abused it will be deleted from tag‚Äù and nothing happened and this was the size changer.,This is a really good game but can you make horror? I know you made a REALLY good horror game called dodoo on side quest (I know it's based of trouts vr game) and that game was really fun so can you do it again but inside this game? Thanks.
