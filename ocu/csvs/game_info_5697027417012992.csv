Skader,"Our Multiverse is collapsing, triggered by a catastrophic spacetime event. Many universes are already gone and just a handful left. Those who survived live in a constant universe incursion state and are about to collapse as well. There is an ancient artifact that can protect a single universe from collapsing and the multiverse sentinels, a pure energy intelligence without a body, decide to conduct an ultimate tournament. The winner will take the artifact home to save their universe. The sentinels pick the best warrior from each universe and invite them to the contest. You represent one of these warriors, provided with a high-end skating device, a helmet, and a trail generator to compete. Each universe gives you a unique skill which distinguish you from the rest and gives advantage. The battle arena contains highly sophisticated features, power-ups, and the artifact. The player who holds it longer wins and takes the artifact home to decide their universe destiny.

I believe this game would benefit more with Gorilla Tag style movement, using your arms to move around the arena. The current movement system just wasn't for me. If the movement system works for you, then you will get a lot of entertainment out of this, but I believe this would be more popular if the option was there to switch movement styles, especially with the Gorilla Tag community.","After testing the game i have impression that feature that dev wanted to be selling point is the biggest problem of the game. Movement feels unresponsive and overengineered. Jumping sometimes works and sometimes not really. When you want to brake you often grab that shuriken instead. Turning sometimes works as you think it should and sometimes you need to wait for the game to let you. All that makes the movement takes too much of your focus you could have on actual game, chasing, making smart traps with trail and using gadgets on others. I see that intention was to make something original, but it is also problematic. I wouldnt mind accelerating with stick/buttons and turning by leaning and turning your body, jumping with button instead of that hand movement. Right now I'm not sure if I want to get back and play another matches, one I had were more frustrating than enjoyable.","SKADER is when Tron meets Gorilla Tag! Easy to start moving but hard to master, the arena is perfect shiny ice and you can skate over it. - LOCOMOTION: No joystick to move around, you need to work hard with your body to gain at least some speed, jump, brake, and even do a 360 in the air for an achievement! - MULTIPLAYER: It's a multiplayer game but the option to play with bots only is available and they can be hard to beat - GAMEPLAY: the goal is to get hold of the cat and run with it until someone stuns you and gets the cat, then everybody starts to skate after the new player. You leave a trail behind you, pick up some powerups and use your Glaive to stun other skaders - VR: you do need to stay and turn 360 in place, no need to have a room-scale setup but playing in a chair won't fly","For only a cheap price you can play this great game,with skating locomotion, fun battles and more, with multiplayer and single player modes,this is a special game buy it now!!!!",I've been Beta testing Skader for a while. This game is a ton of fun. When other active players are in the game it gets excitingly intense. For fans of Tron and/or fans of skating this game is for you
