This one is a bit better than cook-out and better for solo players imo. But also fun with a friend! Absolutely worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper: b i t , l y / s e p s d i n e r",I had the cookout game & refunded it I like this one so much better and it's cheaper 😌,Love it but it needs bug fixes I was playing it a couple days ago and I couldn’t pick up the patty when I was playing the tutorial,"I love this game, but I believe there is a glitch in the kebab truck. Every time someone asks for two strawberries, a banana, and two strawberries - it says wrong recipe! I have no idea what I’m doing wrong. I’ve delivered it raw, grilled, and with just a grilled banana and raw strawberries but it’s always wrong! The same thing happens with the strawberry and pink marshmallow recipe. The picture looks grilled. I grill it, but it always says “wrong recipe.” Maybe you could add a recipe book to the game so players can refer to that for the recipes! I don’t know. That aside, this game is a lot of fun! I love it! It would be cool if you added more restaurants!","It's a pretty cool cooking game. I just loved it! The challenges are cool, the movements are pretty realistic and you feel like cooking for real. You can move yourself inside the kitchen to pick all ingredients and use the equipments. It's only difficult to find others online to play multiplayer. But anyway it already worth for single player mode. The detail is that the game was designed to use walk through a fair amount of space. If your space to play is more limited, you can teleport with the control but the experience is not equal and you take more time. Anyway, a great game. So cool! I recommend to anyone."
