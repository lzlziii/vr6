The realism of the sounds and visuals are of the highest quality. With some knowledge of music theory, using the aid of loading PDF's of the users choice, one can practice and learn the whole range of musical scales, learn songs, and work toward mastery of playing skills, just as if one owned the physical instrument.","I am an Elementary Music educator with a degree for Marimba Music, and more importantly a father of a beginning percussionist. With the start of school and considerations for purchasing a $1500 large practice marimba for home use, I realize this app is going to be our at home practice studio for mallet percussion! Thank you and thanks be to God!","The instruments are pretty cool, but for the price it isn't enough. Adding music sheets doesn't work. most sound is pretty accurate, but very many double notes. Add more instruments from Melodic to Percussive like cymbals, wood block, Chimes. Also would like a way to play with friends as well. Would love to see this work, but it still needs a lot added."
