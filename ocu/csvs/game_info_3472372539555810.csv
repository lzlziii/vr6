Normally I like to play standing, but Quest for Runia works perfectly as a chilled sit down game. I really like match-3 games and this one has a good learning curve - it starts out easy, but in order to get 3 stars on later levels, you really need to think and make use of the special blocks and tactics. There are 7 worlds with 30 levels each, and it took me about an hour to get to the end of world 1. Definitely a lot of content for the price, so if you like this kind of puzzle game, definitely check it out!","Tolles Spiel, hat mir Spaß gemacht! Sehr entspannt und stressfrei :)","This is probably a fun game if you like Candy Crush or something like that. Otherwise you may not enjoy it. If I'm correct, the entire game is solving the cube puzzles by matching and eliminating all the blocks. The world and the wand and magic powers are pretty cool, so if there are any additional gameplay modes coming where you can do stuff beyond solving the cube puzzles, then I think that would really expand interest in the game to a wider audience. Even if you want to stick with the puzzle genre, adding some mazes or other puzzle types would be fun.","Quest for Runia is a puzzle game. You need to find the most effective way to solve many different puzzles by destroying as many cubes as possible in a limited number of shots with a magic wand. The tutorial makes it look like an easy game, but you will soon see, that you have to watch carefully and think a bit before starting a level. There are also boss levels and they are surprising, and they get harder every time. The game is lovingly designed with its beautiful and varied levels. You notice that the developers wanted to create a puzzle game with a special atmosphere in VR. It is definitly worth the pricetag and a nice game for kids, that enjoy puzzle games. I have played the game for a few hours now and stunt some tricky levels where I haven’t reached the 3 stars yet. At the beginning, I thought it was a fairly simple game without much of a challenge."
