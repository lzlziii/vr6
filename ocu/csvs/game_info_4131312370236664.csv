Straylight,"Swing, Soar, Die, Repeat STRAYLIGHT utilizes the revolutionary Fling Engine, allowing you to move through a beautiful and deadly universe in a completely comfortable way. Our bespoke physics engine is gentle enough for the VR n00b, yet complex enough for seasoned VR veterans eager to go faster, fly farther, and cut closer to the fiendish obstacles that litter your path. STRAYLIGHT was built from the ground up for comfortable VR movement, resulting in an enjoyable experience that greatly limits the usual vertigo or motion sickness most users find with other movement-centric games. STRAYLIGHT features 11 base levels wrapping their way around and through an array of massive, ancient monoliths, all set to an original soundtrack composed by Rob ‘88bit’ Kovacs. For those who master the base levels, we’ve included 11 bonus ‘Hardcore’ levels to test your skills to the limit. Also included is a friendly ‘Zen Mode’ for the times when you’re looking for a relaxing experience, want to show STRAYLIGHT off to the uninitiated, or you just want something to do while you listen to the incredible soundtrack. The universe of STRAYLIGHT can be a lonely place, which is why you can unlock GHOSTS by collecting the hard-to-reach cubes in every level. Challenge yourself by racing your previous run or best time. And if you’re hungry for a REAL challenge, square off against our own Bronze, Silver, and Gold ghosts to earn medals and inch ever closer to true STRAYLIGHT mastery.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Racing",English,1.0,Dr. Bloc,Dr. Bloc,https://www.drbloc.com/,"Jan 31, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4131312370236664/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4131312370236664&r=1, https://www.drbloc.com/privacy",549.9 MB,It’s easy to pick up but hard to put down! Great physics and the levels get increasingly difficult with new threats and dangers around every corner. The soundtrack goes great with the gameplay! What a fun way to really be immersed in vr. Must play!,"Being new to VR this game was a great introduction. The game has great movement and physics, all while maintaining a comfortable gaming experience. The game content itself is fun and challenging, with good replay ability as well!","Gameplay design at its best with intuitive and single use controls. Zen, X and ghost modes not found on similar apps such as Beatsaber make this game a must have for all levels of player age and skill levels.",Sling through space kind of like spiderman with energy beams and listen to cool music while doing so!,"Straylight is a fast Spiderman like swinging game in space. You will race through parkour like levels at extreme speeds. The controls are very easy to use, and the swinging motions feel great. The levels are beautiful and full of color. You don't have time to take in the sights though. You have seconds to plan what the next orb you are going to grapple onto to is and get to the check points. You will feel like you are moving through space and get a nice rush from the game. It is a great feeling. The voice that talks to you during gameplay is very comical, and you never know what they are going to say. If you are fan of Spiderman swinging type game, racing through space or parkour gaming, you will want to check this one out. Over all it was a great VR experience.
