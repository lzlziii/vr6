I wish I understand the coach in front of you (no caption for Deaf people like me). 2. Chill with all that talking. I wanna ride my bike and enjoy the scenery. 3. What the heck are those see thru boxes floating to me from left to my right? Am I supposed to punch them or something? 4. Don't think I can pause this app? Bluetooth needs say what it is not all that bunch of numbers. Overall, it is ok. I love the concept of turning the level of bike 1-5 which is cool. Always a room for an improvement."
