Sommad: Impossible Spaces,"Sommad gets you on an adventure in a self-overlapping VR maze. The game has two modes, Action and Puzzle mode.

Key features include: Finding keys, solving puzzles, fighting enemies, avoiding and decharging robots and obstacles, platforms and a map of the level. Key features include: ‚óè Finding keys to unlock doors ‚óè Over 60 clever and unique puzzles ‚óè Explore 5 beautifully designed worlds ‚óè Combat enemies ‚óè Around 5‚Äì6 hours playtime ‚óè Obstacles and moving platforms ‚óè Maps for all worlds ‚óè Leaderboards Sommad recommended play space: 2.5m x 2m Minimum play space: 2m x 2m",7+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Puzzle",English,1.3,Rovango Studio,Rovango Studio,https://rovangostudio.com/sommad/,"Nov 21, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5222241591228707/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5222241591228707&r=1, https://rovangostudio.com/privacy/",Terms of Service,190.5 MB,"update ü§î üëç(for developers) ok all in all the game is good but needs the refinements listed below: the game looks like an alpha ok its ok adding enemies but there are so many bugs i dont know where to start but sorry why not open a discord channel and have the alpha try instead of presenting it like this? At that time... -don't spam the enemies when the player is at the edges of the map, you risk making him bang some arms on the wall, it didn't happen to me but I immediately understood that with more instinctive people it can happen, if you really want to spam the enemies in the corridors near the guardian border then make them spawn far away and not directly in your face. and in any case this applies to any enemy, the appearance effect is really bad and also it's too close to the player, which forces him to take a few steps back, if you want to leave it like this at least improve the enemies' appearance effect. -improve enemies a bit graphically, add collisions, they look like ghosts with no mass, no weight, no resistance, add virtual hand collisions on everything, even walls. - make those green collectible gems translucent, which as they are now look like plastic gems instead of crystal gems - the sound effects ... dunno I put them to a minimum, how ugly ... -sword and bow... instead of pressing buttons, sword and bow put them behind the player's back, so that he can physically grab them and then put them away - Sword angle adjustment does not change when changed in menu settings. honestly i quit the game right away, hard to play when you see so many flaws, i don't want to continue, and is writing one that finished tea for god and eye of the temple with great interest. -handtraking might be needed too, but that wouldn't work well with sword and bow -enemies must be able to fight even with fists, clearly to kill them you will need for example three fists, against a single sword stroke, for example on bats. -I have seen bats fly through the spinning thorn traps as if it were a ghost, passing through the main pole. correct and add collisions. -a handtraking mode could use fists maybe.. I have nothing else to add because I haven't played it much and I don't want to see it again, sorry, maybe I'll try again if I see more updates. I repeat let him try the game, make a discord channel p.s. -often it gets confused to press the map button instead of the sword, if you move the bow and sword behind the player's back as I wrote earlier, this problem is solved too. -put the bloom effect on the eyes of the bats - the first and very short introductory level is the most beautiful of all, as inspiration, color tones and more, you absolutely have to make it a level as big as the others, that blue and those shapes are beautiful. -absolutely improve the water that I saw in one level, really bad, I'm not saying to make it as beautiful as the eye of the Temple (maybe!) but at least improve it -often it gets confused to press the map button instead of the sword, if you move the bow and sword behind the player's back as I wrote earlier, this problem is solved too. -put the bloom effect on the eyes of the bats - the first and very short introductory level is the most beautiful of all, as inspiration, color tones and more, you absolutely have to make it a level as big as the others, that blue and those shapes are beautiful. -absolutely improve the water that I saw in one level, really bad, I'm not saying to make it as beautiful as the eye of the Temple (maybe!) but at least improve it! - need an easier level of difficulty, which also provides for the player to respawn on the exact place where he died. the game is already in development don't test the patience of the players too much, don't tell me that if I die in an advanced part of the map I always start again from the beginning of the level?? - you need physics! for example if I hit the bat with the sword it could end up further back and bounce off the wall and then return to the attack. same thing with enemies, I remind you to improve the spawn effect and don't make them spawn too close.! - need an easier level of difficulty, which also provides for the player to respawn on the exact place where he died. the game is already in development don't test the patience of the players too much, don't tell me that if I die in an advanced part of the map I always start again from the beginning of the level?? - you need physics! for example if I hit the bat with the sword it could end up further back and bounce off the wall and then return to the attack. same thing with enemies, I remind you to improve the spawn effect and don't make them spawn too close. everything I haven't written is what's good or good enough so it's ok, or so it seems to me everything I haven't written is what's good or good enough so it's ok, or so it seems to me thank you for reading and for your attention p.s2 level 3 water ok tonight i played i got to chapter three in the puzzle version. previous recommendations remain. in chapter three the water has improved slightly it seems to me, but the problem still remains that if you look carefully you can see the single squares of texture that repeat themselves, and therefore the water does not appear natural. instead the effect of the water coming out of the pipes is good, to improve the effect of the water at the bottom that moves, because you can see the individual animated texture tiles, from which it is composed.","From walking in a non-euclidean maze, to using a map in such a space, to finding keys, to solving draw-in-one-stroke puzzles, to climbing between levels, to using various kinds of teleportation points, to typing visual codes, to recognizing a puzzle when it looks like a decorative element - this game is full of non-frustrating puzzle mechanics that will make you feel good! And all that packaged in a beautiful environment with lovely music. Could it be more polished? Sure; after all, this is not a AAA game; but it's already a great, relaxing VR puzzle game.","Room Scale games are special in VR and there are not many around that you can experience. Sommad is one of the best i have played natively on the Quest. Using your own playspace (min 2mx2m) you walk around a beautiful Maze completing puzzles and collecting gems and keys. With over 4 hours of content this is an amazing title to check out. You get lost in the world and forget that you are walking around your room, With great graphics and music, and the puzzles not too difficult its a must play game. I highly Recommend it",Giving 5 stars because I'm excited to see the development of this game style. Haven't played much yet. But the developer has been very responsive to my queries and ensured that I'm able to enjoy the experience! So crossing fingers that the game is as enjoyable as I'm hoping. Want to encourage more like this please!,"At its core it's an interesting puzzle game. You search for a lost plant in each chapter / map. On the way you collect jewels, find keys and solve puzzles to open doors and proceed. There are traps, elevators, teleportation places, roboters and more... It's a great experience like ""tea for god"" or ""TraVRsal""! You walk by foot (Natural Walking) in ""Impossible Spaces"". Therefore you need 2 x 2m or better 2.5m x 2m play space. We need more games with this concept! But it's not perfect... I would love to see puzzles with more variety. I want more interactions like switches or levers for moving objects or disarming traps. Maybe hidden secret stashes in the walls where you can find collectibles or achievements... Maybe placing objects (vases, boxes) on foot switches or similar... The maps (which are really good and helpful) should be improved especially to see the different levels. I like the stats in each chapter, but after the chapter has been played, the stats are no longer visible. There are no overall stats or a leaderboard after beating the game (best times, least covered meters...). There are also a few bugs. Lots of room for improvement, but 5 stars because it's already a very good game an makes fun! Hope the game gets updates in the future. Please make more chapters ;)"
