Has a Tron kinda feel to it,which appeals to me,even has the Motorcycles,lol,nice. Very different,which is a plus and there are many achievements and bosses at the end of each level.Also the slow motion and shield and all the other extras you collect on the way through each level. I had played the Demo and was looking forward to this being released today. Thank you developer for a great retro arcade shoot em up.5 stars. Just completed this on normal and now move up a difficulty and get them achievements in my basement on the shelves,looking good and I am really enjoying this game. The PC say's 54% completed,so a fair way to go. Enjoy,great game...","This game has a grid like feel. If you're any sort of a Tron fan, then this is an awesome must-have. It's very fun. I recommend jamming to some of your favorite music and having at it!","9/10 - IMO the gun system feels weak. It‚Äôs fun but it never feels ‚Äúexhilarating‚Äù to me. I like the visuals, the enemy variety, and the concept. I just want more spice and speed in the combat.","Great value shooter with nice retro vibe and graphics, glad I grabbed this on app lab and it def deserves to be showcased in the Oculus store. My only minor complaint is that the main gun sometimes feels a bit ‚Äòweak‚Äô against so many opponents and I‚Äôd love to be able to select an alternative, such as the machine gun, as the base weapon for a full playthrough but then that would devalue the perk system and would probably make the game too easy anyway! Also love the addition of the new modes. Endless mode is trippy!","I legit feel like I‚Äôm scamming the developers for paying this little for it. This game is full of charm, full of fun, and full of that awesome retro vibe you‚Äôve been craving. Do yourself a favor, buy this game right now. This should be in every quest library out there. Stop reading reviews, go buy it"
