The tension starts at the menu screen :). The only things I didn’t like are 1) it takes a lot of headshots to put a zombie down, and after they are down for a while, they will get back up, and 2) you can’t change the difficulty during the game. I ended up switching to easy mode because of how long it took to put down a zombie, but was forced to start a whole new game. I like being able to switch whenever. Even on easy, the final battle was so tense I felt drained after! Some good jump scares, good music, tense, creative, fun! Looking forward to what comes next!","I was a fan of Propogation on PCVR, so when I found out about Paradise Hotel I was blown away! It is so amazing! The Graphics are spot on. The immersion is on point and the fear factor and story is so well put together. Kudos Devs! Another great entry in the library of truly epic VR games! Looking forward to your next project.","Although I'm not usually a fan of horror games because of my dislike for jump scares, I decided to give this one a try since it's been so highly anticipated. Once I started playing, I was pleasantly surprised at how captivating it was. The level of terror is just right - enough to keep you engaged but not so overwhelming that you want to quit playing. The game is polished, everything from the mechanics to the story, to the sound design are top-notch. For anyone who wants to be fully immersed in a nightmare, this game is for you.

Bit scary (in a good way), and very fun and I love just exploring the hotel and discovering new items and the lore/story is great too. Definitely worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper!
