Their limbs are weak, but headshots seem to do the trick like they did in the movies. I tried to board the doorways, but ran out of supplies. Luckily a mysterious stranger showed up with a few upgrades to help keep them from overrunning my residence. Day 164: Today I tried out my new weapons. I crafted a Magniflayer Gun, a Freeze Ray, and fused some explosives into a hamburger I had laying around. I always carry my trusty baseball bat in case they get too close. Plus, after a few snaps of the camera flash to capture some memories, I can slip away unscathed. I honestly can't wait to get up and do it all again tomorrow. Hopefully Bob and Lorainne keep their distance...but I may have made a mistake using hamburgers... Gameplay and Easy Room Setup videos at: tiktok.com/@m4chetecolletti","So this was a bit of a drama to install and required a reinstall, redefining the Guardian and a lot of swearing. You certainly need a big enough room for three doors, a desk and a lot of the living dead. The latter will be the main challenge. I don‚Äôt live in Zuck‚Äôs mansion where this was tested in a spare room in the East Wing so when the Zombies are coming in en masse it can get pretty cosy. The need to position the store table each new level is odd as I just plonk it back in the same place every time. Can‚Äôt the game just remember that? Using passthrough really adds a new spin on the theme, I like the way they climb on and over the couch in my living room. What it also does is highlight how utterly crap the QuestPro passthrough is. Washed out colours make the real world look more miserable than the one filled with maniacal monsters. Hopefully the Quest 3 has better cameras otherwise MR will go down the same 3‚Äù pipe as the Metaverse. Gameplay is linear, the weapons choice is interesting but to be honest as soon as I get the machine gun I‚Äôm done. The shotgun I find too difficult to use despite it being the stock head removing tool as per Hollywood films. The reloading is a pig, please fix. Also grabbing the coins and first aid kits can be problematic if they are in awkward places. Maybe they could just appear closer to the player rathe the door. The ceiling fan is a nice touch but up to now I don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs relevance to the game. I also don‚Äôt seem to be able to punch at close range. There are some other oddities as well but I‚Äôm starting to sound a bit of a maungy git given it is actually a great game for ‚Ç¨10. If there‚Äôs going to be an update, maybe a manhole or skylight for some extra entry points. This might also help people who can‚Äôt fit three doors in their game room. In short, great game that can only get better.","I have tried everything I can think of. Reinstall, restart, redraw the guardian, oculus updates. Nothing works, it just keeps glitching up and freezes. It just won't work. It's stressing me out. I would like a refund.",Good start to games being in front room hope more scenery gets added in as only have 2 doors and aircon ceiling thing And table for weapons keep adding on devs could be a winner üëçüëç,Looks good on quest pro. It real looks like zombies are attacking me in my room. Not to complicated to play and set up was easy. Good old fashion fun for everybody.
