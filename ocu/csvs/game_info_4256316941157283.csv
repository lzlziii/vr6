Should DEFINITELY be on the main store, and it’s i crime that it isn’t. It’s more polished than 90% of the FPS on the main quest store. Trust the reviews. BUY IT. Some of the most fun I’ve had yet in VR. Is there a sequel in the works by any chance?","I tried Shock Troops first and thought it was okay. Clearly an homage to Castle Wolfenstein. But Bionic Hunter is Quake (which I preferred). Not exactly scary (except sometimes the monsters sneak up behind you and the big ones are BIG) and the environments are nothing special and a bit repetitive, but man, those monsters look beautiful. As others have said there are missions to keep it from being just repetitive wave shooting and I hope more are added. I agree with the comments that the pop-up messages are annoying. Even though there is an option to disable them some still come through and are very obtrusive. I don't need to be reminded 20 times that I have to repair two more satellites, thanks! I am truly in awe that only one guy was able to put out such a good game, and I agree it belongs on the official store! Response to dev: Awesome! Can't wait to check out the new stuff. Keep up the really great work!","It's fabulous at a good price too, and I'd say much better than similar games u pay twice as much for in Oculus store. The monsters are huge and graphically scary looking with freaky detail, great art work on the creatures.",Love the visuals in this game and the variety of weapons. Awesome space shooter!,"Look out Quake and Doom, there's a new kid in town. This game is pure and simple fun, but still challenging and chaotic at times, as monsters come at you from all directions. The weapons are cool, the graphics and gameplay are excellent, and the dev continues to update and improve the game on a regular basis, giving us more options to choose from. 100% worth the asking price, and it should be directly available to purchase on the Oculus store to begin with, as it's so much more deserving to be than other games that are for some reason. 10/10. :)"
