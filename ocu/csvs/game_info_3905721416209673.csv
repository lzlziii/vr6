But it won't recognize it. Sad...it looked like a lot of fun.,"It is no longer supported due to the amazing devs making it web xr due to servers costing alot, and sadly it wont work for me with webxr. and if i remember correctly, something about nft's is happening with it. ew. if that didnt happen, i would give this a higher score again, but with the nft thing *i dont know exactly if that IS happening*, and webxr not working for me, i have to give it a 3. when it works for me i will up the score.","I downloaded the app, and when I got in, I had a chance to speak to the developers (they said they like to onboard people personally whenever they can). It’s two guys with no budget trying to bring more free content to VR, which I can’t help but appreciate. The game is growing. Every weekend they try to either fix bugs or release a new game. They recently added a mining mechanic that is fun, and the music in many parts of the app really stands out. Excited for the next few months as they keep building, and glad there is free content on the Quest 2 that doesn’t get boring after 10 minutes.","It is a quite impressive work but horribly buggy. As soon as I moved to the left, the screen went a white and eventually went back to a normal screen when I fell down from the platform. Could not figure out what to do during the ""test your speed"". Hard to control the basketball in the nearby game. The water ride was horrible: lots of flickering, and I couldn't figure out how to get out of the boring ride.",Not worth your time
