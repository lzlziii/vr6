I was intrigued by the premise of this game, and I tried it out for 20 minutes. it is quite good for cardio, and it is fun to see the different styles applied. There are some things though that I hope will change in future releases: 1) It is designed for standing and sitting while playing, and movement is best achieved with the joystick. While it is possible to really walk, you do not see where you are relative to the guardian - in the heat of sparring, this is not good enough and I feel insecure to really move. It would be easy to change this, if the border of the guardian would be displayed as a colored line on the floor, as is done in Thrill of the Fight. That way, large range movements could still be done with the joy stick, and short range movement by real steps. And backwards movement with the joystick should not be possible at the same speed as forward movement. Currently it is possible to outrun the opponent moving forward when you are moving backward. 2) Behavior at ""lethal hits"" When you receive a ""lethal"" hit, the camera switches from 1P to 3P, which is quite disorienting. 3) Weapons Unfortunately, the way you hold weapons are unnatural. The hilt is not aligned with the controller, but it is at a degree that makes it hard to stab, for instance. The hilt of a sword or knife should be identical to the controller. Also, for whatever reason, sometimes the sword in my hand simply disappears in mid-fight, even though I didn't open the hand. Sometimes I can then find it lying on the floor, and sometimes it is simply gone. If there is a reason for this (for instance the opponent has disarmed me), then I need some clue to what has happened. 4) Hand size While the position of the hands relative to my body is exact, the hands are twice the size of my real hands. I could not find a setting to change the hand size. Nice work though!","I was doing the Judo mode, and though I know there are no leg grabs in modern sport Judo, traditionally, there have always been single leg, double leg, and fireman's carry throws.","User Interface is quite crude, but the amount of content is really impressive. It's a fighting game so you can have workout and you can try different modes. I hope this game will be developed. For this price I recommend purchasing immediately. Is there a discord for this game where we can get support and discuss things?","Potentially a 5 star game. The NPC’s look incredible and have smooth fluid movements and realistic techniques. The problems: you have no kicking ability and most importantly, the hit registers are way off. The NPC’s record hits when they are not even close to you. If it was an expensive game I would return it. But for $6 I will wait and see if updates make it playable.",^^^
