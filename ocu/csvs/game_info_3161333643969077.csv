Tracing Paint - The Pollock Krasner Studio in Virtual Reality,"Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner were two of the most influential artists of the 20th Century whose bold Abstract Expressionist paintings helped to shift the center of the art world from Europe to America. Tracing Paint recreates the studio where they painted. Restoring it to the way it looked when each artist worked there. With a Quest headset, visitors are able to explore the studios by teleporting or walking around them, in a room scale environment, to examine the paintings, inspect the paints and tools the artists used to create their masterpieces. Visitors will hear the artists describe their work their own words and hear what critics thought about their paintings at the time. Because of the large gestures they both used itâ€™s possible to discover precisely where Pollock and Krasner painted some of their most iconic works on the floor and walls of the studio.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", 360 Experience (non-game), Art/Creativity, Documentary & History",English,.27,MediaCombo,The Pollock Krasner House and Study Center,https://www.mediacombo.net/pollock-krasner-studiovr/,"Oct 26, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3161333643969077/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3161333643969077&r=1, https://www.mediacombo.net/tracing-paint-privacy-policy",487.0 MB,
