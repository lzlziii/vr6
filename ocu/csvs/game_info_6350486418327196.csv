My wife and I love to play against one another. The only problem is getting opponents. We were the the only two people in the world playing and it took forever for the game to match us up. It would be great to have an AI bot to go up against when no one is on line. It would also be great if you could invite friends & family to a private match and have it count towards the rankings as well as earn money to buy better darts. In the future it would be nice to have avatars sitting in the audience reacting to the game play.","The game looks very polished, but unfortunately in two weeks I was only able to play 2 matches. Whenever I enter a tournament, the game just endlessly looks for an opponent and won't ever find one. Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing for you to do while waiting for someone to challenge so you're just standing there for 5-10 minutes starring at the ""looking for opponent"" message before eventually giving up and either play the training for a few minutes or a different game altogether. The game needs some sort of ""waiting lobby"" where you can play some darts while waiting for someone to come in. It probably would be good to occupy the player by setting random score targets they need to hit in that mode.","Free , but you have to wait forever for an opponent. Gets very boring . I am sure people get sick of waiting and never try again. That being said really fun when you find an opponent.",The gameplay is fine but there is a big problem when you play tournament. The 1st player will bug and cannot shoot when the 2nd player turn both player gets the dart and get shoot and points will go to the 2nd player...no matter who shoots. Hope Dev will patch the bug.,got it yesterday and i think once the game has all its bad bits sorted like the frozen bit when you play another person on multiplayer it will be fine. Also the aiming of the darts is a long way off. But yes i can see this being a great game once things are sorted .
