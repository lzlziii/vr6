Finger Soccer VR,"Inspired by tabletop games, this game offers a unique blend of nostalgia and modern gameplay. To get started, simply choose your teams, formations and options. You'll then be matched with another player online, and the game will begin. The goal is simple: outscore your opponent to be the ultimate winner. You have the ability to tailor the gameplay to your liking by adjusting features like teams, formations, player size, game time, arena, ball properties which can affect the gameplay in various ways. And when it comes to controlling the action, you have options. You can play with your real hands using hand tracking technology, or you can use controllers for a more relaxed arcade experience. The choice is yours. Just be careful - hitting the ball into the net with your hands isn't as easy as it looks. You'll need to be precise and strategic in your movements to succeed. So if you're ready to join the action, start playing now and experience the thrill of online soccer!

The concept is original and the multiplayer mode is a lot of fun. You can choose different options and see how they affect the matches. The gameplay is innovative and easy to control with the controller, maybe little less with the hand tracking... The only thing I didn‚Äôt like much was the graphics, which could be improved. But that didn‚Äôt stop me from having a blast with this game. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the old soccer table games.","Great game. Zero motion sickness, since is a tabletop game and maximum fun. Love the concept. The game is easy and difficult at the same time üòÉ (depends on how you play). Please add the multiplayer soon, in mixed reality would be super cool!","Once I switched to using the controllers, things worked a lot better. It‚Äôs a fun little physics-based experience. Lining up the perfect shot feels great. A multiplayer mode is marked as ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù This concept would work great with another person.","I hate to give low marks on games as it is somebodies hard work. But this game is frustrating to say the very least. can take more then a few goes to make contact with a player. then it doesn't go in the direction you intended or it registers another player as being hit. in around ten minutes of play, the lost hand tracking sign came up, a little while whilst waiting to see if came, it did but then the table is out of my roomscale setting. moving the table is finicky as well. I quite like the idea of what the dev is trying to do. it like a subbutteo and shove halfpenny mix. But in current state not worth the time or money."
