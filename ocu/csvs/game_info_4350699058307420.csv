No, and it doesn't need to be. Color Connect fills its own important VR niche with calming yet engaging puzzles, immersive backgrounds and atmospheric music. This is a great game to play for 5 or 50 minutes at a time. A true hidden gem that's better than the majority of the titles in the main store. Grab it now.","I sank so much time in Flow Free on my iPod touch and it's great to see a similar concept in 3D in VR. This is a very nice experience, puzzles are good (can't wait to unlock the more challenging ones) environments are relaxing and overall it has the right mix of challenge and chill. Definitely deserves a spot in the main store! As a suggestion it would be cool to have a pass-through mode as it is very nice for this kind of games (like in cubism)","This game truly found the balance between challenge and accessibility. As the levels progressed, I really enjoyed how the developers ramped up the difficulty - never too hard, never too easy. I played through all the main game puzzles, and am looking forward to any DLC. Give this game a go. It's easily one of the best puzzle games on the Quest. As a side note, there was nothing more satisfying than opening a puzzle and seeing that a color only had one possible direction - that always felt good.","Every once in a while you need a break from Shooters and Horror games Well this beautifully done puzzle game is the break you need , Different difficulty settings give you a ton of challenges Full 3D view of the puzzle Subtle music Stunning backdrop Seated or standing pick this up today","As a puzzle lover, this is great game, it's simple, to the point, calming. But I have some suggestions to make this even better. UI: texts could use a little higher resolution. These kinds of games should always convey a feeling of delicacy, and resolution for certain elements is the key here. Carmack suggested devs should put majority of texts on a timewarp layer, maybe you guys can give it a try? The depths of the holograms in the center of the level choosing menu is obviously incorrect, and it would cause a little bit eye strain, it's an easy fix. It could also benefit from a higher resolution or anti aliasing, since it should feel like an art piece, right now the shimmering is very distracting. Overall, it's an intuitive UI and minimum which I like a lot. Environment and music: You guys are obviously going for an oriental zen vibe, which is very fitting, but I cannot remember any particular scene or track in the game, they are all kindda the same. Maybe you can introduce some chill or ambient types of environment and music, or change up some color combinations. also maybe check out Tetris Effect for some inspirations. Puzzles: Sometimes if the puzzle have multiple solutions which is obviously the case here, I would feel less accomplished. For this kind of puzzles I think if you guys can develop a more refined way to let gamers to deduct the solution, not just through brutal trial and error, people would feel more engaged. Then some additional tools would be nice, like marks for certain color or cutters to darken the white line (sometimes I know certain ""bridge"" is not walkable). If all of these are done then you could have some kind of puzzle editor to let players upload their own puzzle, to prolong the life of this game."
