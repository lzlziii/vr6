Target React Force,"Train: Sharpen and develop your skills and tactics against the randomly spawned soft targets. Practice your reload speeds and your side arm transitions at the firing range Plan: Use the Intel/Planning Room to plot out your plans and tactics. What entrance point do you think is the best? How will you maneuver? What areas will you clear first and prioritise? When and where will you use your flashbangs? What weapon will you take? What entrance point do you think is the best? Execute: Execute your plan against live targets Do you have the trigger discipline? Do you have the shot? Do you have what it takes? Can you secure the hostages? True random spawn system: True random spawn system to make each time unpredictable and replayable. Live targets will also randomly move throughout the layout to keep you on your toes. Each layout will also have a random amount of targets and civilians so you never know how much or how little to expect each time. Realism There won't be any hand holding here, for example it's on you to be aware of how much you're shooting. There won't be any ammo counters, it's all on you not to get caught out. In the heat of the moment did you fail to fully arm your gun? There won't be any highlighted parts to help you out. Remain calm and quickly fix your issue or quickly transition to your sidearm. if you go through a doorway without lowering your gun, you will find your gun being blocked by a wall and will be unable to shoot your target.",18+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Action, Shooting, Simulation",English,1.0,Inside Universe,Inside Universe,https://insideuniversevr.wixsite.com/insideuniverse,"Jan 4, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5771326126292623/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5771326126292623&r=1, https://insideuniversevr.wixsite.com/insideuniverse/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,892.0 MB,"I do have suggestions though to make this even better and that it of course multiplayer. Multiplayer would help make it more realistic in breaching in with a squad. Another suggestion is possibly night missions, this would also make it more realistic in a way that it could also add night vision. Another suggestion is customization extension, this would like the player pick through a variety of sights, lasers, flashlights, mag mods, suppressors, and more. Commands/negotiation with enemies, this would allow you to command enemies to drop the weapon or put there hands up and more but to also to make the player having to make a decision where the enemy might be tricking the player or actually comply with the player into arresting the enemy. Player customization, if you are adding multiplayer then this would also help so then people don't have to look at usernames to know who is who. Blood settings, this would allow the player to customize the blood into no blood or realistic blood.","First of all this game is well made and especially the live scenarios are great because they feel somehow much more dense and real than tactical assault for example regarding the cqc aspect. Still some things should be polished up a bit: First, the whole setting looks a bit trist. Grey in grey and few colors make it look a bit washy. The graphics are decent and to me this looks nicer than the Polygon-style of tactical assault for example. It's good to have different training options from stationary targets up to a live scenario. The training house can also be randomised which is great. Maybe some more weapons should be added which would greatly add to the replayability. But what's missing the most is some sort of hand to hand option when you run out of ammo. So some sort of knife would be great or of this doesn't fit into the police/swat-context then you should be able to grab and redirect a weapon to buy yourself some time and punch an opponent down or be able to grab and push them down to ground and handcuff them similiar to what you do with the hostages. Like this you could also have the challenge to finish a mission without even killing anyone. Enemies AI could also need some work. They should move faster and maybe seek some cover or run around a bit more but right now they seem to be a bit too static. Also some menu button ingame would be good to choose the destination where you want to go so you don't have to walk around the base and look for the type of scenario you want to play. Some ingame option to quit your present mission would be good so you don't have to walk back to the swat truck all the time. After your mission some sort of analysis would be good like how many targets you neutralised and how many hostages you saved, the time needed and maybe how many shots fired and how many hits you had. Once the mission is over a clearer signal could be given or some menu could pop up to show you that you have just finished your job and don't have to walk back to your truck. Lastly I don't get why you should plan your mission on a tacical table with several figures when you are on your own anyway. This would only make sense with multiplayer or if you had bots in your team that you could give orders to which would be a great add on as well. So all in all I understand that this game is an Applab version and I really enjoy it. I also see a lot of potential in it but as it is right now it needs some more polishing.","A decent game for $13 plus tax. Some tips: A setting to change the angle while holding the glock, and maybe a higher resolution model. Gripping a gun, hold and release would be a nice option. also the gun is a little close to the magazines on the chest. Gripping is kinda slow, there is a slight delay when gripping to when the visuals in game grip. Maybe a dark mode and add flashlights and lasers attachments. More guns. I like the game, I know this is an indie game, so any update is appreciated. I suggest the developer look at VR Practical Shooting (App Lab) and Shotwood (App Lab), also indie tactical shooters, for ideas. There was an update and now the controls are weird. The controls were fine for me before. I can turn/rotate but I cant move or I can move but not turn.",This game has really good graphics especially for such an early state and the gameplay is very smooth on my part. I know there’s a big update coming out and I really can’t wait this game is really good for its state and I think it has a lot of potential. If you can figure out how to add multiplayer this game I feel like would be known more and gain more players but so far the game is amazing!,If you are into tactical breaching games this is for you. The game just got put on app lab so it’s not completely finished but it’s really fun Ideas: -enemies will get back up if not shot enough -fake hostages (This game kinda reminds me of ready or not) -maybe you can add some maps like houses or decorated rooms -arms -more guns The game is really good for 13$
