I've had it now for awhile and I'm a big fan of splatoon so this is Even better my opinion being it's in vr. Also it's free yall!! Yes 100 percent free and honestly if it were to change right now and have a price I WOULD ABSOLUTELY PAY WITH NO PROBLEMS. Give it a go AND YOU WONT B DISSAPOINTED. AND I AM WILLING TO BET ITLL BE ON YOUR TOP 3 FAVORITE GAMES AND THATS A FACT. LAST the devs Even join in gaming and they are super cool and fun to play with:),"If this game was released as it is now, i would have to give it 3 stars or so. But this review was published while the game was in 0.4.5. The gameplay is immersive and complex, with multiple weapons (goozmos) to choose from; branches of each, and multiple maps to choose from, giving way to creative strategy and expertise. The Community is Grade A and on point. Moderators are always available if help is needed, and the players in general always are helping new players by teaching them the gimmicks and strategies. Developers have open ears for new ideas and feedback. I personally have had multiple of my ideas put into updates and patches. Overall the game is just plain fun!
