I initially thought I might face motion sickness like other racing, fortunately didn't have any of those issues with it here. Absolutely loved the Car Wash Mode, spent a good bit of time just washing cars even when they were clean. I also enjoyed some of the game modes that were there in the PC version from a unique perspective. I know that the developer consistently updates the game on Steam quite often. Hoping that this version is no different and has a tons of new updates. If you enjoy Micro Machines and Mini Motor Racing on Oculus, definitely give it a try."
