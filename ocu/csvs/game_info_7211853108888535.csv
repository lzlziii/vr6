I don’t wanna follow some dumb discord I just don’t want to have to sign up for anything else at this point I’d be happy with emails stating when anything is happening or SOME kind of update? This game looks like it’s going to be off the hook, and worth good money.",I enjoyed the demo. I needed more space to move around than l had. I found to enjoy the game you need to stand. I will buy the game and recommend it to others when it's completed.,"Tried the demo and it has me wanting more. The graphics are great. The puzzle mechanics are fantastic, very interesting, clever and intriguing. The one hallway where you go downstairs I was anticipating a jump scare and almost didn't want to go down, but thankfully no jump, thank you for that, lol. Looking forward to the full game and more great mechanical puzzles, someone did great work creating those. Is there an estimated release date? Can't wait.","Much of VR truly bores me, but to my surprise this game (even as a demo) offers a fresh approach to VR Game play. I was completely immersed (not because of the graphics- while they are good) but because the puzzles kept my mind occupied and I was fully in the game. As you develop this further the only thing I would add is a sense of urgency as some point. I would have enjoyed some more stress in feeling like I needed to figure this out in time ""or else"". Please give us the ""or else"" element and complete the project. FANTASTIC","Reminds me of many an escape room experience in a room exquisitely similar to this. I couldn't really latch on to anything here and get going on the mystery, so I just messed around."
