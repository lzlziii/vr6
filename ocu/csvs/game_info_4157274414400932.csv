No shooting zombies or fast-paced run and gun, just simple, fun puzzles involving a hampster and your ability to solve the tubular puzzles. Get the hampster from point A to point B to point C (etc) until he finds his food and the puzzle is solved. I was surprised at how entertaining it is to play. I just bought the full version (this is the demo) but the demo only gives you the basic, simple and easy puzzles, wait until you see what comes next! Kids will also love this game because it has several adorable hampsters running around in their habitat. They will be having so much fun that they will never know that they are learning cognitive skills as well as puzzle-solving and eye-hand coordination.","I think I will be buying the full version of this its very entertaining not seen nothing like it graphics are amazing, sound is spot on settings can be altered with is perfect I can't wait to get this.",Loved playing this. Great thought gone into it. Just finished casino level 6 and thoroughly enjoyed the game. Right amount of thinking without getting too frustrated! Will definitely purchase when the game gets upgraded,"I absolutely love this game!!! I'm a massive fan of hands on puzzle games, The graphics are amazing you get to tap, poke, grab, twist and turn things, put together a remote control then use it to move a ball round a maze... But then there is the cake levels!! Wow just wow the little begger puts the cake ingredients in his mouth then makes a tiny cake in a tiny oven that u then feed to him it's just Soo adorable I'm in love with this game, ain't even got to the casino levels,.. can't wait to c what the coming soon section is.. this one is definitely worth your time especially as it's totally free!!!!","Best twist to a plumber type game that I could ever imagine!! This is BEYOND Cute af!! If you like games like plumber, This is All You!!"
