It’s a shame development came to an end this game has so much potential and is already so much fun in a vr experience.,"I am in LOVE with this game. Can someone answer me, how is it free?! I bought the developers a “coffee” but it looks like only a handful had done the same. And this game is so fulfilling. It’s my own little village where I can garden by my house, hang out and collect things on the beach, build up my ranch and animals, fish in many different areas, and I can even mine for ore… which is very satisfying for some reason. The ONLY thing that I wish was different, was if there was more of some kind of social interaction. it gets a little “lonely” Otherwise, great job!!","It is a great game, but the lag and fishing glitch is a little Emerson breaking"
