Vendetta Online,"Vendetta Online is a cross-platform 3D space combat MMORPG, allowing thousands of players to interact as the pilots of spaceships in a vast universe. Users may build their characters in any direction they desire, becoming rich captains of industry, military heroes, or outlaws. A fast-paced, realtime ""twitch"" style combat model gives intense action, coupled with the backdrop of RPG gameplay in a massive online galaxy. Three major player factions form a delicate balance of power, with several NPC sub-factions creating situations of economic struggle, political intrigue and conflict. The completely persistent universe and detailed storyline add to the depth of immersion, resulting in a unique online experience.",12+,Multiplayer,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Gamepad","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Flying, RPG, Space/Universe",English,1.8.656,"Guild Software, Inc.","Guild Software, Inc.",https://www.vendetta-online.com/,"Mar 4, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4340670129365944/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4340670129365944&r=1, https://www.vendetta-online.com/h/privacy.html",Terms of Service,641.7 MB,"Quest needs more games like this, with depth, hundreds of hours of playtime. Feels like a small Elite Dangerous in VR. Highly recommended. Hope in the future they add interactive cockpits with virtual Hotas, virtual buttons and switches to control things like flight assistant, target selection, etc. Would also be nice if docking was more challenging like in Elite Dangerous, and if stations interiors were different from station to station. But overall I am impressed with the game, and I highly recommend it to any space inthusiast.",awesome game,"Here's 25 off for starters: rb dot gy /8mbo2 The game's got a bit of a learning curve, especially in vr, but once you get the hang of it, you'll find yourself exploring a huge and immersive sci-fi universe. There's a ton of stuff to do, from shooting stuff up to trading and mining, and you can communicate with other players to form alliances but that's not really my thing. Honestly I basically just took courier jobs while playing the Firefly soundtrack and that was pretty amazing. One thing I will say is that if you're looking for non-stop action, this might not be the game for you. There's definitely some menu navigation and progression stuff to deal with, but it's not too bad if you're willing to take the time to figure it out. And make sure you go through the tutorial, because it'll give you a good overview of everything.","I have been playing VO for a long time in VR i started e Samsung VR , this app is awesome and i hope they keep adding more and more nice stuff to it","This game is a lot of fun. I played it on PC and it's even better in VR. To the developers, please add multiple languages"
