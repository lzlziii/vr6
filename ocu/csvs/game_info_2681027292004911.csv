If you are considering purchasing this game (or others on Quest) click on my pic and then “chat” to DM me as I can help reduce the price you pay. (See the end of my review for more help). This has now become my favorite Rogue game of all time. I bought it as soon as it released and I have not been disappointed. I have played literally hours and hours and watched online sources for hints and tricks so I could master this game. It is easy to get into the play and progress but it takes a while to learn the “best” techniques to master getting a high score – or let’s face it – not dying too quickly. This is what I think makes it so much fun – you can actually, with planning, ensure you are well armed and strong enough to fight the bosses. There are three distinct areas you progress through, and each area has two sections. There is a boss at the end of each area (3 in total). And there are 6 “categories” of character that you play – each category, when complete, unlocks the next character. Each character has a distinct style of weapon and each weapon has to be mastered. The graphics are fabulous, the sections are randomly generated so you do not enter and fight the same characters or scenes – they are different each time. Even the treasures, tarot cards, weapon upgrades and ammunition supplies are different each run. Note: ammunition can be scarce – use it wisely! I don’t want to include a spoiler here but I did find a safe way to ensure a section is saved and can be returned to rather than going all the way back to the beginning – it took me a while to find this “trick” and I did die and start the run again multiple times in the beginning until I realized how to create a safe save point. I started this game and was so caught up in the fun that I literally played it every day until I finished it. I think it took me several weeks to get through the whole game. I do also think, because of the randomly generated scenes, weapon upgrades and loot, that this is incredibly repayable. I have some recommended sources for tips and tricks and I am happy to help if you have questions. I really recommend this game – try it – if you like Rogue games this is a gem! I hope you enjoyed my review – considering clicking the “helpful” button! All my links can also be found on l i n k t r . e e / b l i s s 2 1 2 1 (just remove all the spaces).","It’s cool. To me, it feels like all the best parts of an rpg and an arcade game together. Fun, endlessly replayable, and way too addictive. I’d guess I have around 150 hours or so in it at this point, and I find myself playing a run or two before I load up blade and sorcery. Truly one of the games of all time.","The game is great, mechanics are lovely, everything is perfect, but it would be so awesome if you could party up with other players and there could be this whole system where only one person can be one specific class, or it could just be an team of rifleman, or scouts, would really make the game more interesting, and there could be an feature where you could give your teammates equipment and weapons, ammo, ect, but you both have to be willing to give and accept trades so there can’t be any stealing, this includes anything you could find in the levels of the game, like if one person finds an item, it’s there item so the other players can’t use it unless that person lets them use it","LOVE THIS GAME!! I've already put in dozens of hours. It's tough (with 4 unlockable difficulty levels), and so very rewarding. Feels a bit like an FPS Dark Souls. Finally great to see a rouguelike where you actually feel like you've progressed after you die since you then get to spend rank points on unlocking weapons, extra lives and more. You also unlock classes. You'll also have a greater understanding of your weapons, unlockables and your ever-more-varied-and-powerful enemies. Worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (remove spaces, case matters, and the comma is a dot): b i t , l y / F r i e n d T L B","This Roguelike is like if you took the best weapons of WW2, some bosses inspired by dark souls and doom then Sprinkled some Holy Warhammer style just for the heck of it. Gameplay is extremely easy at first but after you start to unlock classes upgrade guns in the Hub World the game throws everything at you with enemies getting smarter in the earlier levels throwing enemies at you that you didn't even know existed like soldiers with trained crows. The replay value of this game is endless 1 run is never the same except for boss rooms however bosses do get harder the more u upgrade in the hub. Levels and loot are randomly generated as well as enemies later on. If you like games that are endless or challenging and just want to shoot stuff this game is for you."
