Shrouded Citadel,"An unknown force has pulled you to the Citadel's location and beckons you to enter. Unique traps and puzzles await you on every floor with a variety of obstacles intent on stopping you. While inside, you'll discover entities which will try to help you and others attempting to prevent your escape. Upon entering you'll find a plasma cannon that will give you access to puzzles and the means to defend yourself. It will pack a punch but you should choose your shots carefully, especially when a looming presence confronts you.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Adventure, Shooter",English,1.0.27,Pifer Studios INC,Pifer Studios INC,https://shroudedcitadel.com/,"Mar 21, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5342829222412095/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5342829222412095&r=1, https://shroudedcitadel.com/privacy-policy",911.3 MB,"The general game idea and the levels are nice. But the execution is flawed and you can get better puzzles in many other games. You don't grab things or interact with puzzle items, merely touching them is enough to achieve most tasks in this game. And graphically it looks more like a GearVR/Oculus Go title. With more content a few updates this game could become pretty good I think, but as of now I wouldn't recommend it."
