Nada, zilch, NOTHING shows up on the other side of the board in the Japan environment just the game pieces that move on their own. Gameplay is okay, so if you want basic chess, yes this offers that. Chess Club VR outshines this for better graphics and online play. The new update will not let me choose anything. Unable to play.",Game has yet to load for me. Just the neverending load screen,I just learned to play chess (only took 38 years) and now I’m addicted like none other. The 2 best parts of the game is that it’s very accurate hand tracking system and the puzzles.,For some reason I got this game for free anyone know why?,Game is nice but have you planned to add lichess / chess.com integration ?. It is so difficult to find good club players Update 10/12/22 7 millions of mobile players ?. No. Searching for an opponent and no seeking response And there are only 37 reviews so very very few players
