Climate Change Pinball,"Climate Pinball is a pinball game about climate adaptation and resilience. You play the game to save the planet, and the goal of the experience is to encourage behavior change and climate education in a fun and interactive manner. The overall message of the experience is that positive change and to help remind us that climate change is not a lost cause. This is not the first crisis humans have encountered, and it won't be the last. If everyone does their part to push for good habits, reduce consumption, and demand policy change we can turn this around.
