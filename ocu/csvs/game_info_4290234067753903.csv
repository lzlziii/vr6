Didn‚Äôt add any games I can buy. Didn‚Äôt make it easier to use. Instead, it made me exit my arcade, go through an alley, and go to a different place. Now I can‚Äôt buy the axes for my personal arcade, can‚Äôt expand my arcade, AND have to input a new code a different sharing lobby experience. Kind of frustrating and a bit of a letdown. Axes are cool, but I have to create a totally different lobby. I can‚Äôt buy the axe game for my arcade at all. And not only that, you now run out of room in the arcade for more games. So so so disappointing. Still 4*, but the axes is such a letdown on implementation. ‚ÄîOG Review‚Äî Title: I forgot this wasn‚Äôt real üëÄ This is the first VR game I‚Äôve played where I forgot I was playing in a VR Environment. Crazy immersive experience. üçøTLDR The game is fun; the tasks are a cool way to understand the gameplay as well. A but expensive, considering DLC, but a solid add to your library. üî•EXPERIENCE Where this game shines is in the multiplayer aspect. Yes, everyone has the same arcade games, but playing in someone else‚Äôs arcade & seeing their creativity is great! My teenage son and I play together and it‚Äôs so much fun going to his arcade, playing games, and sharing life. It‚Äôs an amazing way to connect with family and friends in a truly retro way. Arcades always were a magical way to connect with people and this VR option captures that very well. Also, at one point it was so immersive that I nearly sat at a table and talked with an NPC. ü§£ I have never had that happen with VR & it‚Äôs a credit to the experience the Devs have built. ‚ö†Ô∏èMISSES & NEEDS Like all VR games, people want more. More games to play, etc. Leaving that obvious note out, there are some minor improvements I think could be made. - MORE ROOM: the Arcade barely has enough room to buy all the games and some furniture. It‚Äôs rough if you want to expand and have duplicates of games. - USE META QUEST AVATAR: not a fan of the avatar in-game. It would be great to have an option of using the avatar we created for the Quest in general. - LOCAL LEADERBOARD: some people want to be tops in the world. They will find the bugs and leverage them to be on the board. Good for them üëçüèº. I‚Äôd like to see a leaderboard for friends or people who have been to my arcade. A local leaderboard would make that feature meaningful‚Ä¶as of now, it‚Äôs just a bunch of randos I don‚Äôt care about and wouldn‚Äôt ever attempt to beat their scores.","Positives: first of all, bravo, you guys took on the challenge of making the game and connecting with big brand arcade people as well but most of all actually making the games playable and all while having things like character customization and building customization, I love it and I‚Äôm ready for any updates 1.) When moving quickly around in the game and the peripheral vision has that dark blur, it‚Äôs a good touch BUT it just flickers on, it would be much easier on the eyes and less annoying if it could like smoothly transition to the black blur and not just plan black, like the edges barely faded black and to the farthest of the peripheral, dark black.","Love this game, very fun and incredibly accurate compared with the physics and detail compared to other games that are similar. I would love to see coin pushers. If Andamiro would be willing to collaborate, the SpongeBob coin pusher would be so cool (and they also have a lot of other cool games)","The whole thing is great so far, but I do agree with everyone that you should keep expanding the game library. Especially since what we have so far is just a cool bowling alley and a dozen or so quick ticket earning games. Those types of games are certainly a staple don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they are only a portion of the arcade experience, there are other bigger games that really draw people and have them playing for hours. I do know you‚Äôre probably the most active vr devs I‚Äôve seen, always working on updates and are very good with responding to reviews and even listening to requests. So I know you‚Äôre working on making this the best possible. I know someone already gave you the idea for laser tag and another one suggested things like skeeball so I‚Äôll just state that I agree with them. But If I were to request anything else, I‚Äôd suggest looking into getting the other types of arcade games too. Like the light gun shooters, fighting games, racing games, and side scrolling beat ‚Äòem ups. You know, the big feature games that people spend most of their time playing in the arcades when their focus isn‚Äôt just tickets. The whole arcade experience just feels a little incomplete without them. Also maybe a few classic old school games. Though I can already guess that electronic screen games like those are possibly a bit of challenge with software and hardware limitations. Though I do have an idea concerning at least the light gun games. You know how a lot them now a days are housed inside isolated booths with curtains and such? Maybe use that to your advantage and seat the player(s) in a tiny separate game map that looks like ‚Äúinside the booth‚Äù when they choose to play a light gun game or something? Would that cause less technical stress on the game overall if it was just a tiny space with just the player(s), the controls, and the ‚Äúscreen‚Äù? I‚Äôm not a programmer so that‚Äôs mostly just a guess on my part but I‚Äôd figure I‚Äôd throw that idea out there because I really want those kinds of games in this. I wish you good luck on this project of yours and I hope to see it grow into a true must have experience for VR. Update: alright, skee ball. Like I said, I agree that was a good other suggestion to use. It‚Äôs as you said, it‚Äôs a long running classic (nice additional touch with the bowling alley). I Hope to see more added to this library. Especially my personal suggestions for the big electronic games. And speaking of, if your trying to figure what to do about the fact that most of said big games don‚Äôt give tickets. Maybe make it so those types of games will produce far more revenue for the arcade than others (due to them usually being token suckers), and have it so the actual players get tons more experience playing them (since they‚Äôll probably just be using the free credits option for those). Update 2: the axe throwing thing is a neat addition and the axes you can win at the prize store are really cool, though I wasn‚Äôt expecting to have to walk to a location outside and down the street just to do it, honestly I was half expecting it be another hidden chamber in the arcade. I mean the idea that the street outside your arcade is possibly going to become a giant entertainment district over time is a really exciting discovery and I can‚Äôt wait to see what else pops up outside, but are you going to make said street a little less‚Ä¶ creepy at some point? I don‚Äôt know, a dark empty city street and alleyway in the middle of the night with no one else around and only the noise of barking dogs, ambient wind, and far away cars is setting off some nervous instincts when I trek out of my arcade.","The games are fun and feel very realistic. The base game is quick to realize but the devs seem to be releasing new games recently and I‚Äôm really excited about skee ball coming. Recently the developers have added public rooms to the multiplayer functionality. This could potentially be one of the best games on quest over time. 8/26/23 Update: Recently Arcade Legend has added BATL Axe Throwing as a free content update. This content is a first look at expanding gameplay beyond the arcade. New axes can be purchased with tickets and the different axes have varying stats. Hopefully the dev studio will continue with these types of updates. If so, this game will be a beast in time. Two thumbs up!"
