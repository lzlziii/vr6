My experience goes all the way back to pong in the 70's. Of all the genre's of video games one of my absolute favorites is escape room style puzzle solving...I've played and beaten the best. To me,the Myst series of games by Cyan was king of the hill for decades. Fireproof games??? You have earned my total and absolute respect! The Room is a MASTERPIECE! It combines clever and challenging puzzles with a world so stunningly beautiful, I have stopped in areas just to marvel at the attention to detail in every area of this game. If you enjoy escape room puzzles...Trust me. Don't miss out on this one.","my sister, brother and I all played this game and loved it. slightly challenging but not too challenging- they did a great job with this game and fantastic graphics. I would recommend this to all the girlies who used to play nancy drew games growing up :)","By far the best game I've played on Quest. Some (very few) people have said it's too short, but I've played it over several sittings rather than rushing through, and I've avoided the hints as much as I could, in order to get my money's worth. I'm satisfied that it's equivalent about to 4 solid nights at the movies and worth it, most definitely. Don't rush through. Savour the puzzles, don't be in too much of a hurry to cheat, stay away from walkthroughs if you can bear it! Loved it. Wish there was another just like it. üëç","Loved the Room and was so excited to get the VR version by the same developers..nThe graphics and puzzles in this game are amazing. Hints are given if you get stuck. Love this game and was sorry to get to the end. Hoping for a sequel at some stage! Buy it, you won‚Äôt be disappointed if you love a great puzzle game. There is only teleporting movement but for me this didn‚Äôt take away from the experience.","This is one one awesome thick adventure of a puzzler. I have heard so much about this game from the iPhone days and had zero interest in playing it. My eyes aren‚Äôt that great and I gave up on games that require you to look meticulously around the room for objects (iPhone). But solving these puzzles while I‚Äôm ACTUALLY there is amazing and gives me no excuse to complain if I can‚Äôt solve one (and the game is not bugged). There are 3 main levels at 3.5 hours (plus two semi levels working on strengthening the plot and tutorial) and so a little over an hour per room (level). It took me an average amount of time doing all the puzzles without hints, they were a little more challenging than ‚ÄúI Expect You To Die‚Äù (which I absolutely loved) and requires focus and patience (like all good puzzlers). I only bought this on sale because $30 for 3.5 hours of gameplay is steep. Wait for your Oculus30 or use mine below instead, or have it gifted to you. Either way I‚Äôd get it because it‚Äôs one of those games about EXPERIENCE rather than length (quality over quantity). I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs definitely little excuse to not getting this one. It‚Äôs really, really good just like people say. The graphics are realistic hence grainy but set the mood really well. It‚Äôs like steampunk aesthetics what with all the indecipherable gadgets and their functions, and the fact that your surroundings look like the 1800‚Äôs Now take this spamming! Take it!
