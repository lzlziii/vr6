Skategirl Destroys the Universe (timed demo),"SKATEGIRL DESTROYS THE UNIVERSE is a game played on TV screens floating in a surreal 3D VR space. On the screens the player controls Skategirl, who just destroyed the universe. The player in VR must grab, move and fit together the TV screens like jigsaw pieces to create a path Skategirl can move through to escape the horrible consequences of her own actions. SKATEGIRL will be available for sale in 2022. In the meantime, this time-limited demo will be available during Gamescom (Aug 23 - Aug 29, 2021).",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Arcade, Puzzle",English,1.0.19,"Mermaid Heavy Industries, Ltd","Mermaid Heavy Industries, Ltd",https://mermaid.industries/,"Aug 23, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4287777787950777/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4287777787950777&r=1, https://mermaid.industries/page/privacy-policy/",69.0 MB
