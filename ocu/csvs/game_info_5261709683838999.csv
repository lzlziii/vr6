Not really impressed with the environments as rather blocky, but once in gameplay it doesn't matter as such. In the tutorial it tells you how to get the lightning coming down( again blocky), but doesn't say if it effects game score, or even if it does. The gameplay is your basic two colours sort of thing, with a switch at times to one colour but holding the grab button instead(you can keep the grab button held at all times anyway. You have like little demons running towards you in various orders and position and flying skulls, so you get a lot of movement at times. To be honest tried the hard level on it and was too much for me trying to keep up with the changes, but sure that wouldn't be the case for younger people. But I did enjoy the gameplay on the whole. But I am convinced that some hits of mine showed up as missing. It is debatable if it is me or a glitch in the game. But as a new release any glitches will get sorted. You get ten tracks for the time being, with more coming early in 23, with a story mode. Music is subjective in taste. But I really thought it was rather average and forgettable and I can't see me really playing this much even with the promise of more tracks. I hate to be negative about the music as I think the developer is a part of doing the music as well as the game(could be wrong) You may be wondering why I gave it 4 stars, yet be rather negative towards it. I can see a lot of people enjoying the gameplay, it's something different to exercise to.",Congrats on getting v1 out there.. can't wait for more songs and quality of life upgrades!
