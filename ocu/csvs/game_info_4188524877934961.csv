BlackCarbon,"An ecological catastrophe. Everything is black carbon. Is that all? There it is, a single plant fights and survives successfully … Which plant is it? How did it survive? Let’s see here, let’s get closer to it … However, it runs away … Runs away from me, away from the human, runs away to survive… Will it? Or maybe the plant that resists, that flees, is a symbol of life? The elixir of life? Hope for the future? Demonstration of the power of nature, survival … I am a being that has also survived the ecological catastrophe, which tries to attract the eluding tree, I am Übermensch, above death, above every devastation and catastrophe. Can we work together to rebuild the world which technology has destroyed? I try to approach the tree that is distrustfully fleeing, to cultivate and make our common future better.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","360 Experience (non-game), Art/Creativity",English,"0.1

It has made me realize the importance of trees in our life and we should not remove them or else we will have to play this game, which is a masterpiece dont get me wrong, in real life. The other reviews are total bogus do not trust them. This game is something to be remembered forever. I rate this game 5 stars, but I'd give it a star for every tree on Earth. Best Game Ever.",This is so stupid. You literally are walking after this tree. That’s it. Dumb,is exactly as advertised. you chase a tree. for far too long. Idk if there is anymore this instantly bored me to tears.
