Masterfully verified gameplay, excellent responsiveness, excellent soundtrack and style. Roman - you are a talent, continue in the same spirit, I will support you.",A super addictive runner with heaps of well-executed gameplay mechanics that kept me coming back for more. Big thanks to the dev for providing 2 codes to giveaway in my best of App Lab video: https://youtu.be/ZNFV4r8MAYw,"You will be amazed how a game can take up so little room on your Quest and yet have more depth than most of your library. Try the free demo, and come back for the rest! :) Also I recommend turning jump settings to head position if you are having trouble with wild jumps. The hand position jumps (default) offer more freedom, but can be difficult to master. Personally, I prefer having this setting on head position. Menu/UI took me a minute to figure out, and it also took me a bit to figure out that I couldn't turn while holding onto the katana. Love the dancing tutorial man!"
