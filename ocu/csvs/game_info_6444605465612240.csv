Octonic,"QUEST 2 AND QUEST PRO ONLY. MULTIPLAYER. GIVE YOUR VR RUNNING WORKOUTS A DESTINATION. Transform boring treadmill workouts into VR fitness adventures with friends in Octonic’s virtual worlds. And now, a non-treadmill run-in-place option is available! Combine immersive VR with the natural movements of walking, jogging, or running on a treadmill. Just step on a treadmill, put on your headset, perform a quick calibration, and start exercising naturally in VR. Octonic’s Motion Engine connects your Quest to 40 treadmill brands, allowing full control from VR. In non-connected mode, Octonic is compatible with all fitness treadmills. For those without treadmills, we now offer a stationary, run-in-place mode, allowing you to stay in shape without the need for extra workout equipment. Demos of all our running worlds, which include gaming, competitive, and recreational trails are included with your free download. Full worlds are available in-app as à la carte purchases, an all-worlds bundle, or through subscription packages. Octonic supports a swappable hand-tracking and controller interface. Use a non-fabric head strap, like Kiwi, for jogging or running.",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer",Standing,"Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,Health & Fitness,English,3.2,Octonic,Octonic,https://octonicvr.com/,"Aug 23, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6444605465612240/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6444605465612240&r=1, https://octonicvr.com/privacy",4.47 GB,"I'm enjoying the app and the developer support is just great! I see a huge potential for this app. It's already a lot of fun and I believe that with new headsets and a PC version (if possible), we'll be to walk in some awesome places. I already like it a lot!","This app has a great deal of potential. The basic functionality, especially the safety features, are great. I've played three worlds so far and they feel like a good basis for more development. This feels like a great start, I can't wait to see what else gets added in.",I would like to see a xreal version quest is very bulky not your fault. Don’t like the music. I would rather use Spotify,This game is what I have been looking for!! If you can get the graphic to be like Supernatural app this would be 10 stars hands down!! I just subscribed for a 3-month trial. A glitch I observed during the walk: The map screen next to the avatar keeps flickering between horizontal and vertical positions. It's distracting. Keep it up!!,"This is a very good start for what is going to be an excellent exercise app. I love the pass through and the ability to see the treadmill. This makes it super comfortable. The interface is good. The scenery is a bit boring. It needs more animals, plants, bushes, etc. The music selection is ok. Please add the ability to play youtube music. Also, as another commenter mentioned, the pace seems to be off. I am using a non-bluetoothed treadmill. When I set my treadmill to 3.5 mph and the app to 3.5 mph my feet are going faster than the scenery moves. It does keep perfect time with the steps of the avitar though. Anyway, to get it to feel right with the movement of the scenery, I consistently have to set the app to go 1mph faster than my treadmill. Otherwise it just feels off. I know you've responded that the pace is accurate - but it doesn't look and FEEL accurate. Can't wait to see more worlds."
