War Yards Beta,"War Yards is a 1v1 multiplayer shooter that approaches bullet time combat in a whole new way. The game utilizes a unique set of mechanics that allow each player to control the speed of their opponent‚Äôs projectiles. Bullet time mode can be activated at any time, but while active it restricts the player to room-scale movement only and removes their ability to reload. These mechanics create an unparalleled combat experience that seamlessly blends fast paced action with tense strategy. War Yards combines these innovative gameplay systems with incredibly detailed stylized maps to make for a truly unforgettable VR western adventure. Features: - Challenge your friends to intense and highly strategic 1v1 duels. - Utilize incredibly unique multiplayer bullet time mechanics to outsmart your opponent. - Explore 4 highly detailed stylized maps inspired by classic western settings. - Enjoy the freedom of playing with users across nearly all VR platforms.",16+,Multiplayer,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Shooter",English,"0.1.6

Good gunplay really good maps and makes me feel like im in the west,"Garbage, first start. Just start over .","This is the first game that has genuinely made me made now I have played cactus cowboy and games like that and those games still have charm but this game is terrible, number one the ai is so OVERPOWERED every round they shoot hits and they don‚Äôt reload and I am on easy mode on the tutorial level and the health doesn‚Äôt make it easier in fact it makes it harder. Now I said at the time when downloading this, I hope multiplayer is good, well guess what no one and I mean no one has a sever online cause no one plays this shüí©itty game and I know you (the creator of this game) update your game but you haven‚Äôt noticed the ai being WAY too powerful and number too the levels are so lazily made that no detail or anything stands out, its like you pulled 3d models out your üçë and placed them around with no creativity in mind or thought like is their anything else then barrels or lanterns or crates or wells in the first level. I had high expectations when I saw a pvp cowboy game but then I get this a dumpster fire. In summary DO BETTER.","The bullet time mechanic is what makes this game insanely fun, and it‚Äôs the ONLY way to win, since the ai hit every shot that you don‚Äôt slow down and dodge in bullet time. This is NOT a run-n-gun shooter, but it‚Äôs extremely satisfying dodging rounds coming from multiple directions and taking enemies out at the same time. The game definitely needs polished, but the devs are most certainly on to something here!","The game is glitchy, aiming sucks, its hard, its shallow, etc... yeah it has potential but its so goddamn far from it"
