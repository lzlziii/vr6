There has to be a sequel to explain.","Read the reviews, its all true . Fun adventure and puzzle journey using your own created drones to help repair the clocktower.

This game has been on my wish list for some time, and I bought it during last week's summer sale and I just completed it last night. The developers did a wonderful job captivating a beautiful story and a puzzler all into one nice package. I'm 53 and loved it. My son is 8 and also loves it (Just know that an 8-year-old needs a LITTLE guidance with this game and puzzles). There's three Save slots also, so other family members won't ruin another's game. The only thing you will be disappointed about is that it ends too quickly. I spent about 5 to 6 hours total playing (Oculus really should create something or it tells you how long you've spent in a game. If they can track the return window for a game in hours and days spent they could do the flip side of that for the consumer), mostly because I'm a completionist when it comes to games.","This is the best vr game I have ever played. It perfectly balances gameplay and story, something a lot of puzzle games I love on here do not do, it successfully makes the player both have a reason to play because of the story motivation, as well as general motivation to engage in the world. The music is a perfect little piano melody that gets intense when it needs too, the story feels like I’m reliving memories by how it presents itself, puzzles are not difficult, but still intrigue me, surprisingly polished for an indie vr game, and the overall vibe is perfected. It has been a huge inspiration for me, an aspiring game dev, and a really nice experience overall. 10/10, if I could wipe my mind, I would wipe this game from my head to experience it for the first time again.",This game was AMAZING. there where some times where I got stuck on a puzzle but besides that it was one of the best oculus games I have every played.anyways I wonder will there be a second game or maybe a prequel to the game where you play as edea (I think that is her name) or a DLC maybe? I know this would take a long time but the wait would be worth it.
