Give Me The Future VR,"Journey through the world of Bastille‚Äôs ‚ÄúGive Me The Future‚Äù, the #1 album inspired by our relationships with technology, lucid dreaming and the coming together of the real and the unreal. Allow Future Inc. to transport you to the Innerverse, where these concepts are brought to life in a stunning virtual reality experience. Explore four songs from the album captured at an exclusive live performance, including a never-seen-before piano version of ‚ÄúNo Bad Days‚Äù performed by a 20-storey high hologram.",16+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", 360 Experience (non-game), Music",English,1.2,WPP,WPP,http://givemethefuture.co.uk/,"May 18, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/7360356487368039/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=7360356487368039&r=1, http://givemethefuture.co.uk/givemethefuturevrprivacypolicy.html",5.31 GB,"This is such an amazing experience. I just wanted to check it out, but now I just love going back again and again. Pull your trigger buttons while enjoying the experience, it's a pretty cool effect. Distort the light beam has become one of my new favorite songs. ü•∞",Omg this was freaking awesome I mean 10 out of 10!!!!!!!,"Another one of the nebulous 'future experiences' that is just music videos, but not the good VR ones, like just normal ones on a stage, and you're like 'there', but. no. The music is lame too, but that's subjective.",One word: WOW! More words: What an absolutely brilliant experience. Each song and corresponding environment/effects really encapsulate the Give Me The Future and Future Inc. narrative and I can‚Äôt wait for more VR content from Bastille. Even my 68 year old mother loved diving into VR with Give Me The Future. (How about a Bastille song pack add-on for Beat Saber? *hint hint*),"Loved this experience and would probably never have listened to Bastille normally but this makes me want to keep listening, more bands should do this!"
