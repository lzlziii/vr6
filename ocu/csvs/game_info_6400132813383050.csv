The physics are quiet well and the hitting Model feels natural and challenging enough for me, giving me a similar feeling as in real life (without the ball weight impact of course) The customizable ball machine, called Drilling Lab is the most advanced i have seen so far in a vr Tennis game. Together with a Helloreal Adapter its great fun to play and practice. The developer is responsive on discord and reacts very fast to suggestions made (if they make sense). So, in summary, i already give 5 Stars, as the game in its current state is already offering all Important Features you would expect from a vr Tennis game (AI Match, called bot Match, online matches and very advanced customizable ball machine). The devoloper allows to Start playing the game in a free Mode, where not all feauteres are available, its worth and without a risk to take a look for everyone who is interested in vr sports or Tennis especially. And i am pretty confident there is (much) more to come... 5 Stars already üëç","I regularly play tennis with retired pros, college players, and club monsters. I'm subscribed to The Tennis Channel, TennisTV, and I attend pro tournaments to spectate when I can get a chance. Needless to say, I love tennis. And If you love tennis like me you will love Court Time Tennis. It features the most true to life physics I've ever seen in a tennis game and has a ton of settings you can mess with if you want to simulate different scenarios. The shot assist mode was so good at interpreting my ground strokes that it took me a few minutes to even realize I was being assisted, and the unassisted mode feels more realistic than I previously thought was possible for this generation of VR. Directional ball spin actually matters as well as velocity. The developer is constantly updating and open to feedback so I am very excited to see this game grow. At the moment the game is geared toward singles play drills but there is an excellent multiplayer mode, wall hitting mode, and a moving ball machine bot that simulates competition. I'm sure there will be more in the future so I'm not really too concerned. Considering the game is only in beta at the time of my writing this, Court Time Tennis is a 10/10 for me.","Open court is just plain fun. There's a lot you have control over, the different spin you can put on the ball. It's also a very generous free version with all kinds of drills and rallies you compete with others in. The physics are top tier. In the manner of walkabout, eleven, and crazy kung Fu.","This is the most realistic tennis game I have played. And the standard version is free! You get numerous 'game drills' and 'warm up rallies' against a bot to test your skills. Each one has a 'star rating' to encourage you to improve. There are a range of customizable settings. You can play in different venues and on different surfaces to name just two. Each week there is a new leaderbaord to see how you fare against others. You can also match play against a bot with increasing levels of difficulty. If you upgrade to the Pro mode then even more settings are configurable for each drill. So ball speed, wind speed, spin, pace and even racket bounce and grip styles. The Pro mode also allows you to access the multiplayer mode and take on players from around the world. Loads of fun.","From the dev of ProShot tennis which had much promise. Already with the wall, passthrough, robot, wind physics etc this is elevating it above the competition. There are some good tennis games now and I've played them all. This feels the most fluid and natural in terms of swing and physics. A very talented dev well worth supporting."
