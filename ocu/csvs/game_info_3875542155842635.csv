If you set your weapon controller alignment correctly, you may feel like you are hitting targets instinctively. I only tested pistols, since I don't have a gunstock yet. But from my experience as a practical shooter of real firearms, it feels really cool. It's also nice to have the ability to create your own scenarios. Lots of possibilities here, with further improvements it could be the best way to practice IPSC, PCC and more. For a better experience it is recommended to have as much space as possible, so that you can move freely through the stages. Thanks to the developers for the work and I hope this project continues growing.",This is an awesome game!!!! This is a great way to get your USPSA practice in when you can’t make it to the range. Practice your time and accuracy. Choose between day and night shoot. There is also a discord site you can join and shoot with others. This game is definitely worth it for sports shooters.,This is a very good platform to plan your techniques and shooting walkthroughs however the gun mechanics could be better Gun Club Vr has more realistic firearm mechanics really wish in the future this app adopts the same mechanics. This app has alot of potential and recommend everyone to try it out. It still has bugs such as appearing very tall in the game and trying to quadload with shotgun but the pistol part is very promising. Looking forward to this game to be completed,If you are looking for a training tool for IPSC or a bit of fun? Then look no further. This is awesome fun and a real training tool.,This Is the best shooting simulator I’ve ever played if you enjoy shooting this is the sim for you
