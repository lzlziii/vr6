From painting in a huge studio, to having a smaller canvas on a scenic boat view, this app absolutely delivers on every front. My favorite feature to utilize so far is the stencil feature. It allows for even the most artistically challenged of people to make stunning pieces of work!! I really enjoy the music accompaniment while creating - my only suggestion would be working in a web browser so I can watch stuff while I paint/draw! Imagine having a YouTube painting tutorial you’re able to follow along with!?!? Or just watching some mindless entertainment between thoughts of what to do next! There are so many tools you can use to best showcase your creativity… compared to the couple other art apps I’ve played, I foresee this keeping me captivated and coming back the most. Thank you devs for creating this gem of an app!!!","So first off, let me say that I am NO artist! I’ve always wanted to have an “artistic” side, but the “logic” side of my brain wants everything to be symmetric… That, and always trying to be “perfect” with hand-drawing makes it really hard for me to be “artistic” per se. I’ve tried multiple different art applications on the Quest and this is the first one that has an actual solution to mix both art and the symmetry that my mind needs when being “artistic”! There’s a “Mandala” mode that allows you to draw but then replicates whatever you draw as part of a circular pattern. It reminds me a lot of the designs you see from the Diwali holiday that India celebrates. I find many of those colors and patterns mesmerizing and the mandala canvas allows me to replicate those patterns in a very uniform way. There’s also a mirror canvas that replicates everything you draw on one side to the other side. I haven’t completed any art in any other application until this one. I like it a lot!",This is a great game to have in the library. It’s the type of game that you can sit down and play whenever. It is very relaxing to play and doesn’t get boring because there are so many different stencils along with many environments to be in. Highly recommend this game even if you aren’t a top tier artist.,I was on the fence at $20 but figured I could return if I didn’t like it. Very cool app. I’d like to see an export option so I can print these in real life. The ability to size my canvas also for printing. I’ve made a few cool TikTok’s with Arto. Looking forward to seeing where this goes. I’m a daily VR artist so you’ll be seeing me around. S o far Zen is my favorite part of the app. One thing I shake a bit as I’m a bit older. Any way to enable steady hand? That would be huge.,I am by no means an artist or anywhere close to it but Arto makes it easy for all skill levels to create amazing masterpieces. There are so many different locations to create and even stencils so no talent people like me can make something recognizable. The tools take a minute to figure out but after that they are easy. The developer is very responsive to feedback and obviously cares about the user experience. I really enjoy this app.
