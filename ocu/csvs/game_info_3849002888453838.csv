Cute but serious minigames are fun to play and the concept is interesting. Recommended for dads like me.,We didn't expect we are still playing this game. My kids love it so much.,Even better with fishing and stuff...liked it alot.,"Mini games such as tennis or bowling, I think these refer to Wii sports, are not bad. It seems I can meet people at... lounge? or something, but I haven't met someone yet. The game has many contents, but shallow now. Need more updates, and users. I will recommend to play this game for VR/Quest beginners.","With the update, the game got sweeter. I like the new moods of the house!"
