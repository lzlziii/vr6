Kill It With Fire VR,"The good news: Kill It With Fire VR gives you ultimate freedom to hunt down and murder spiders. With fire! And ninja stars. And rocket launchers. And a submachine gun. And a huge range of other weapons, too. Take on the role of an exterminator and destroy mankind’s most ancient and deadly eight-legged nemesis. The bad news: It's SPIDERS. In VR. And there's a lot more of them then there is of you. Don't say we didn't warn you. But you're not going in alone. You've got a huge arsenal of weapons and technology to help you do a little bit of population control. And if there’s a little collateral damage caused along the way? Well, it’s best to be SURE they're dead. Features: - Large arsenal of unique weapons and equipment - Eight different spider species - “Realistic” fire simulation system - Gratuitous chaos and destruction - Dozens of optional objectives - Loads of hidden upgrades - Battle in the Arachno-Gauntlet! - A secret ending?!?!

It was short but fun. Huh the voices In my head are back What burn it all ok 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,I personally had no bugs clean graphics and I love how you had almost the same guns but in different styles of the guns and all the new upgrades with a big difference between the x box/console it was fun and even when I showed my mom when she was buying it cuz she had a pin she seen the trailer and even she was like wow.,Best game to kill time and stress definitely recommend it. If you only want to play for 12 minutes. I finished all the acrachno gauntlets in 2 days but I’ve kinda had loads of experience in real life. WTH was that ending? After you finish the game (took me a day) you can play the levels over again. My hands glitch out a lot. The guardian doesn’t work so well. there’s nothing down here what did I say?

Spiders will take you by surprise sometimes which’ll get a scare out of you, but you can just brutally murder them. Which in a very twisted way, is a blast. Get this game for a fun time. Also please add multiplayer 🙏"
