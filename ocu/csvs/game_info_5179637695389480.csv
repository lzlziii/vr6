I'm sure that must bug other players. Flak guns are easy to spot anyway without those pesky indicators. Thanks.",I love the game but I wish move into the jet age.,WILL YOU PUT PREMIUM PLANES IN THE JAPANESE HANGER PLEASE!!!! FIX MY SCOPE ON THE TANK. OTHER THAN THAT ITS A GREAT GAME. ITS LIKE BEING IN THE COCKPIT!!!!,This so good. The physics are not arcade like at all the grind for new planes is not very hard at all. Canâ€™t wait to see if you plan to add more aircraft to the game.,I just wish you could turn off the hud elements and maybe if there were more controls you can push or flip that would be great too
