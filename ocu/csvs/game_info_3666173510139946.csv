Sploder Golferoni,A goofy golfing game where you can slice giants in half and also see how many points you can get from hitting targets,16+,Multiplayer,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Sports",English,0.1,Matt Pistella,Matt Pistella,https://www.facebook.com/StellarPistol,"Apr 6, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3666173510139946/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3666173510139946&r=1, https://www.stellarpistol.games/home/privacy-policy",344.0 MB,Ok Iâ€™m a little embarrassed to say I had fun playing this. The physics and graphics are not great. I also canâ€™t consistently get the same swing twice (and I even swing and miss a bunch). So whatâ€™s fun? It was actually kind of cool to play this as a driving range game and I played for about 30 minutes. The real pay off though is when you hit the guys. It is incredibly satisfying (I wonâ€™t spoil it).,i was so excited i love golf. no good at it so i thought this would help but nooooo very inacurate. stupid guys waving for no reason are irritating as hell.balls go where ever they want. not even worth the 1 star. sorry,If you play it I donâ€™t need to explain itâ€™s badðŸ—‘ðŸ—‘
