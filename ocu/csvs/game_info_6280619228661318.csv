REFLEX MASTER,"""Catch!!"", ""Hit!!"", ""Dodge!!"", ""Elbow!!"" Here you will find a variety of games that will train your reaction and coordination skills to the limit. All games will increase or decrease in difficulty depending on success or failure. Therefore, the level of difficulty is automatically selected to match your level. Catching games improve hand-eye coordination skills. Hitting games improve quick and accurate positioning skills. Ball avoidance games mainly improve upper body avoidance skills. Elbow strike games mainly improve motor function in the shoulder area. Wall avoidance games improve the reactivity of the whole body, including footwork. Combining several of these games at the same time requires more complex and quicker situational decisions. For advanced users, there is also the ability to create and save/load your own customized and unique training. You can freely change the range, timing, and speed of the target, or even the size of your own hit points, to create a training program that suits you best!",3+,,", Action, Sports",English,3.4,resetstyle,http://www.eonet.ne.jp/~musouken-kobe/,http://7rs.jp/vr/REFLEX_MASTER.html,"Apr 26, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6280619228661318/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6280619228661318&r=1, http://7rs.jp/vr/REFLEX_MASTER.html#PrivacyPolicy",Terms of Service,144.3 MB,
