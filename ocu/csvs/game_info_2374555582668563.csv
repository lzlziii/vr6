As your journey continues, you must decode the events of your past while confronting the dangers that lie ahead. Hitchhiker is a road-trip odyssey about exploring the unknown in order to find yourself. Hitchhike across a strange and beautiful landscape in five rides with five total strangers who will challenge your grasp on reality... And maybe your philosophy on life.

Felt a bit frustrated by how minimal my actions and choices mattered though, but still ""along for the ride"". The driver seemed to talk in riddles that amounted to nothing, but I figured would all come together at some point so I attempted to be attentive even through the monotony. Was relieved when I finally finished the first driver. Second driver: even more monotonous and at this point the unique scenery that you drive around in circles tested my patience all the while as I looked around the car just in the hopes of an escape. This driver somehow managed to be even be more infuriatingly dull and at one point even admits that his ""sage wisdom"" that I'd hope would amount to something, was just placating lies. At this point after the myriad of other dead-end ""puzzles"", useless props you find and expect to mean something, do something, have a point at all!, and the pointless mindnumbing stories I just wanted there to be some kind of discovery that didn't just lead to more questions that I could care less about. Third driver out of five: Nope I'm done. I thought I was patient enough to at least get to the end to at least make sense of this shallow prosaic alagory, but I chose to just look up what it amounts to. I am glad I did, because apparently it's so vague and unsatisfactory in the guise of trying to be cerebral and letting you come to your own conclusions. Reading a few conclusions by players who managed to labor their way through still made me roll my eyes by how little I cared about the outcome of such unstimulating characters.",This is definitely more of an interactive story then a game. However I still though it was worth playing. The acting was decent. However the gameplay was a little uneven. Chapter 2 made me sick but chapter 3 gave me the motivation to keep going. The puzzle solving was a lot harder then the flat screen version. Not because the puzzles are hard but because the controls rely to much on motion.,"When I got to the ending and the credits rolled I was kind of surprised. It didn't feel finished, at all. It felt all over the place and confused. It was a strong start and some parts were okay, but even Dexter had a more exciting end in the first series and we all know how disappointing that was.","UPDATE: Thanks MadaboutpandasBerlin! I managed to get past! If you like surreal games, and want something relaxing yet mysterious, this game is for you. Part low-key puzzle solving, part philosophy, it's up to you to figure out what happened to your missing girlfriend. Motion sickness is an issue at times, especially when you have to repeatedly go in circles. The controls could use some refining. But if you like a little weirdness, this game is worth a try. Previous: I've only played the first part of the first chapter because no matter what I do I cannot ""tap the driver"" to continue the conversation. I thought it might be a boundary issue and spent time trying to ensure he was in my boundary, but even then, I could not get the game to progress past that point. So far I'm intrigued. The motion in the car does not make me motion sick. But if the controls don't work you can't play the game. The four stars are because I think it could be engaging. I really warmed up to it, but could go no further.",This is a NARRATIVE game people. Not alot of game. Adults would like the mystery n understand it but 25 n under I just don't see many liking it. I did get pulled in from the mystery but in the same I dont think there's any real replay value. If the game was 10 or 15 and ya like narrative games then by all means but don't expect alot of solving. 90 percent is listening and picking 1 out of 2 options 2 respond. No offense but this wasn't my kind of game. Just not enough game involved.
