Pandemic by Prisms,"Have you ever wondered how scientists developed strategies to limit the impact of the 2020 pandemic on human lives and health systems? Pandemic by Prisms is an algebra learning game that builds lasting fluency with exponential functions and allows you to apply algebraic thinking to one of the most important problems today - the global pandemic. While it does not deal with the science behind pandemics, it is designed to equip you with foundational algebra skills to understand how to make informed decisions about a critical public health issue. The purpose of this beta launch of Pandemic is to gather feedback and spread awareness of its final release and of Prisms' full Algebra library launch in September. The complete Algebra course will include 5 multi-part modules on the topics of linear functions, quadratics, exponentials (Pandemic), systems of equations, and statistics.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Narrative, Strategy",English,0.5.61,Prisms of Reality,Prisms of Reality Inc.,https://www.prismsvr.com/,"Mar 18, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3079043625531665/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3079043625531665&r=1, https://www.prismsvr.com/privacy",916.6 MB,"Really enjoyed it. With the use of a real world problem, interactive elements, and great visualisations, the app makes math much more digestible and fun. Itâ€™s a bit short and left me wanting for more, but would still recommend!","The tools that are developed are simple to operate, very intuitive. The integration of video and narration is really well done. I see great future for it. It's a really solid base to expand on. Needs a bit more work on polish and being mindfull of playspace limitations. But seriously I'm impressed. Usually those types of apps are incredibly dull. Doubly so if I already understand it. But there is a joy of discovery here. I really hope that at some point I'll be able to use it to learn new things myself.","I bought Pandemic to add some math education to my son's VR screen time during the lock-down and it was a hit. He was intrigued by the game's ""mission"" which was to develop pandemic containment models using exponential functions to stop the spread. The experience was relevant and ""real"" and the game play got progressively harder which kept my son engaged. He's pretty critical of ""learning games"" but this experience was different. He completed the modules, mastered the algebra functions and successfully contained the spread!","I played through this experience last week - and although the pacing felt a bit slow for me personally (in part because I already understood the concept that was being explained), I can imagine this being a very valuable tool to teach abstract mathematical concepts to students who still need to grasp how exponential functions work. I'm looking forward to seeing what other modules will be added in the future!"
