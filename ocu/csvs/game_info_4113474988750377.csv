Z-Race,"Z-Race is a fresh take on the concept of VR racing, complete with high-quality graphics, unique track design, and our very own “Formula Z” racing ships. With 15 tracks of varying difficulty and creative lore, prepare to be immersed in a high-tech futuristic universe. Compete by flying 13 Formula Z ships across three different speed classes, each equipped with your own companion coach, voiced by your favorite members of the VR community. Intuitive controls and motion design create a game that provides the racer with little-to-no motion sickness, allowing absolutely anyone to play. The multiplayer experience in Z-Race is designed to assure you’ll always have competitive opponents to play against, and not be stuck with ones that are too slow—or too fast—for your skill level. No matter how good you get at flying Formula Z, you’ll never be alone. The faster you are, the more competitive your rivals will become.",3+,Multiplayer,Sitting,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Flying, Racing, Sports","English, Chinese (China), Japanese, Korean",1.0.11.5,XOCUS,XOCUS,https://xocus.co/,"Dec 27, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4113474988750377/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4113474988750377&r=1, https://xocus.co/privacy-policy-eng",1.46 GB,"Interesting take on a racing game, the sound bite about hitting the wall was funny the first time but quickly gets really annoying - especially if you are learning to play it. Seem to only be able to play 'asynchronous multiplayer' no single race, career or time trial and when I did race I came 6th and said I was first which was odd.",I loved Wipeout back in the day. This game gives me the same rush and improves it. The controls are awesome and easy to get used to. This game is really fun and I love it. I hope the devs fix the loading speeds. Also it would be great if you could select the next track when you finish the track. Now you can only repeat the same track.,"After playing for about 15 hours and getting number #1 in the leaderboards on every track I am posting this review. Z-Race is phenomenonal. It's creative, fast paced, and competitive all at the same time. I have been playing time trial racing games at high levels for over 10 years and this is the first one in VR that really earned my respect from a competitive viewpoint. In the game, you control a ship with your hand/arm and navigate around the tracks while racing the ""ghosts"" of other players that have a time that is similar to yours. As you improve your time, you get new ghosts of players further up the leaderboard, which drives you to improve further and adds so much replayability. The skill ceiling in the game is high, you have to learn the tracks carefully to grab boosts and use them at the best times to save the most time, there is also a slow motion technique to help you grab boosts that are in awkward areas. I will be playing this more and optimising my times further. I honestly cannot say how happy I am with this game because I've been looking for a competitive racer in VR for a long time. Suggestions from me - A replay mode so I can watch my ghost or even others ghosts. A way to restart my runs without having to finish the run (there doesn't seem to be a pause menu?) A way that I can race against my own ghosts. A mode with no obstacles. That would be very cool and optimized from a competitive perspective. Great game. Thanks again. I look forward to more projects from you in future. Good luck getting Z-Race onto the official store, it deserves it!",The game is fun but the settings are just not their. It’s small and not very helpful. I wanted to see if I can change my camera angle to first person or at least change it to look like I’m in the car unlike just holding a car. It is fun but not a lot of customization not optimization. The loading screen to leave takes so long it’s quicker to quit the game. The intro themes are also very buggy and glitchy. So little customization that you can’t even turn off the narrator. It has potential.,"If you tired with ports of classic arcade game, try this one, it has own way to control which is really easy to get in, however, i doubt you can get first placeses everywhere. Race with nearest players in chart by ghosts."
