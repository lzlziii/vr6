Engaging, intuitive and fun. I really like the overview presentation of the midi file and look forward to developments which incoporate the color selection Dom has made into the waterfall learn mode.","Well engineered and thought out! As a beginner, I'm very excited at how well this works with our regular piano, which had been idle for too long. Makes learning much more interesting and challenging. I'm looking forward to how this progresses, particularly with the beginner lessons. I'm hoping to see right hand and left hand exercises added soon. So well done -- I would gladly pay for it!","Very impressive software, but sorely needs logic to skip or remap notes that are outside the range of the selected piano size.","Amazing work the developer is doing here, i`ve tried all the piano apps on quest2 and this one blows them all away and its free","Experienced amateur pianist here. Instant sense of how a song fits on the keyboard, how it sounds, and when I hit a wrong note. Better than sheet music. Metronome/Beatsaber-like experience is both fun and discourages bad habits like slowing down on hard parts or playing the note wrong over and over because you misread the sheet. This is the ONLY way to sight-read music. This app is awesome as it is, but I have suggestions. Turn on note names and fingering labels and autoplay. Turn off the input stopper thing. This should be the default settings. Note recognition didn't work with my real piano at all. I detected wrong notes myself by ear when my real piano didn't sound like the midi. A mode with working note recognition (audio only) and hides the handtracking hands (unless doing menu gestures) so I see my real hands would be AMAZING. In fact, if I could run this game menu with my controllers that mode would be fine. Handracking is a hindrance if it isn't working perfect, the option should be available shut that junk off. Maybe one day it will work well enough to depend on. A shared library of uploaded songs (within the headset app) would reduce the need for us all to duplicate effort of song creation. Just browse and download, or upload to share after making something new and awesome. Simple rating system for contributions. A full-mp3 audio experience would be great too. Like Beatsaber. Instead of hearing a midi when you play well, you could hear a real recording of a pro on a concert grand, or you could hear the duet part and the drums or whatever. The more real-music and game-ified this is, the more compelling it will be."
