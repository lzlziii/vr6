Slam,"Slam is an innovative multiplayer tennis game designed exclusively for the Meta Quest platform. Notably, it stands out as the very first rhythm-based tennis workout experience in the gaming world. Central to the game mechanics is an energy gauge. As players engage in matches, they have the opportunity to charge this gauge by hitting targets placed around the court as hard as possible. Building up this energy is crucial because it unlocks the ability to unleash a power shot. Landing a power shot can drastically tip the scales in favor of the player, giving them a significant edge in potentially clinching the point. To master the game and maintain a competitive edge, players accumulate energy by consistently hitting these targets on the court.",12+,"Single User, Multiplayer","Standing, Sitting, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,"Music & Rhythm, Social, Sports",English,1.0,XRSYS Labs,XRSYS,https://www.xrsys.net/,"Jan 28, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6416298631718700/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6416298631718700&r=1, https://www.xrsys.net/privacy-policy",571.7 MB,"I really dig this game. The core gameplay loop is fun and enticing, and watching it develop as they refine and add has been a lot of fun. The multiplayer is tight as well. Overall a great, solid game for fun or to work up a sweat. Easily worth the price.","I loved the Demo version, so got the paid version a couple of months ago. It was well worth it. I like it better than any of the other tennis style games I’ve tried. I happily play both standing and seated. I’m looking forward to more music!","It's a nice lite workout game with catchy music, and nice graphics, I really like the idea. But the aiming is ruining the experience. It seems it doesn't matter at all, what angle you hold the racket when it touches the ball. So if you have played real life tennis or Eleven Tabletennis, you will miss a lot of hits unless you unlearn how to aim in real life and try to figure out how the hell this game works. Of course I understand this is a more arcade style game than Eleven Tabletennis and needs some auto aim, and it's impossible to hit the ball to the net or outside the court, but often it messes up my otherwise good aim and the ball travels in a totally differet direction it should. If the devs can fix this, it will be a fun game to spend hours with, but in this state you will get frustrated in five minutes and go play someting with good controls.",The game is a lot of fun and gets you moving. It does get a bit repetitive. The only real objective is to chase a higher score. I am not a fan of the music but i can live with it. It is worth the purchase of the full version. Can't wait to see what they have coming in the future.,"This is a great game, it's fun trying to beat your own top score! My only minor complaint is the strobing lights within the game, I find them quite distracting and wish they could be turned off - but that isn't enough to knock any stars off. Looking forward to future developments! Edit: Since the update I find myself enjoying the game less. I just want to get into the game ASAP but now I have to navigate a virtual arcade to select SLAM. Simplicity was a great aspect of the game - two clicks and you're in the court but it's not the case any more"
