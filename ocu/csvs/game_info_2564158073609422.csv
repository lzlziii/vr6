What do I do,"This game is probably one of my favorite games on vr! A lot of people say this game is bad, but DON‚ÄôT LISTEN TO THEM!!! 1. A lot of people say this game is bad because adults are saying things that shouldn‚Äôt be said in front of kids. While I understand this, it isn‚Äôt the games fault. Let‚Äôs face it, people are going to say things. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you try to do, people are allowed to say what they want. If people are being rude to you just turn your volume down, easy fix. Then mute your mic and your all set. People in this game want to be able to communicate with each so they can tell their location, or tell if there is a enemy. Besides, it‚Äôs meta that allows people to talk, not the game! 2. A lot of people dislike this game because it just recently turned free. I think it was a great idea! Now you can play with your friends and neither one of you have to buy it! So what if there is an 8 year old kid playing‚Ä¶ he has a right to play just as much as anyone else. In conclusion, it‚Äôs a great game. Just trust me on this. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. If you don‚Äôt get this game, you‚Äôll be missing out!üòÅ Please leave a like if u found it helpful!!! :D","So I've played this game for about two years, and ive out of to make my reciee until now. Let's start with the positives 1. It's incredibly fun! Being able to climb anything enhances your mobility and gives way to many movement techniques. 2. Gun metas. Unlike many other games like Warzone where there meta might stay the same for a while, the meta moves around like frequently. Now there are a couple guns that are quite popular for use that perform well, but the most powerful gun will switch around whether it's from the P90 to the 1911. 3. The gun skins. The gunskins look really sick. It's nothing necessarily special too gun skins from call of duty or it's gold and shining everything, but they are unique and really cool to your guns. The only negative with this is that they suck at switching up the shot. As they're only good for switching it when you need to pay for it, which recently seems their most focused. Lets go over the negatives. 1. The community. Just like any game, not everyone is nice. Since the free to play update, you will run into your fair share of kids, let's just say they think they're above everyone else. Also, if you're a female/girl, it's better to play with your friends, etc. Almost whenever I play in a lobby with a girl and there's other boys / men, they'll get absolutely ripped apart. With the absolute most insane and rude insults known to man. But don't let that be a reason why you don't download this game as it's not everyone. 2. The game devs. Recently, people have been disappointed in the fact that the devs have veered away from making a game the community loves, to trying to monetize as much as possible. They just seem to overall stop caring. 3. Skins. By gosh, they have a ton of cool skins, just so dang expensive. They have monthly skins for playing the game, but it their just lazy reskins where they just change the shirt and pants and call it a new skin. They need to make the monthly skins the same quality as the one you pay with for bureau gold. TLDR: really fun game, toxic community sometimes, sometimes towards women, expensive shop, devs focused on monetising instead of making a fun game.",I give this game a five star review because I love it. But I have a love hate relationship with the fact that they made it free just kinda make me mad because I paid what was it like 30 bucks for this game and then they made ot free and yeah they tried with that og banana bs but I wish that they would give us people who paid for this 30 bucks in store credit of some gold in this game of equivalent value. This game has ok graphics I mean if they were better than would have to nerf the render distance so I understand why they are bad from a game dev standpoint but there not like free mobile game on the app store bad. The game play is awesome its fun and kinda stressful but overall if you've played fortnite before it's VERY equivalent to that. The looting system is what it is its not the best like (in my opinion) ghosts of tabor but not as bad as some of the other games that I have played (for the sake of my account I won't say them) I wish that they would remove the wheel and you could have one slit on tour back and one on your aide simpler to padlov if a main on your chest and a side arm like onward or breachers. The map is not randomly generated but the loot is. Overall I would not get this game unless you get mad at getting killed and losing all your stuff this is also a battle royal that you can't be by yourself and kill everyone and everything in sight you have to be with a squad and then you drop and then you loot and then you kill everything in sight also you will encounter some kid screaming rhe n word in your squad and it could get kinda annoying but I wouldn't mute your squad until you establish that there not all children. But overall I like this game and it's not like fornite you can earn skin and stuff though event battlepasses by playing game and you can earn gold from doing quests so if you don't want to you can not spend money on this game if your alright with that. I love this game I would love to get in a match with you if you find this helpful press the button below if you want to but most of all love yourself love others and be yourself thank you for your time and goodnight or goodmorning or when ever your reading this.
