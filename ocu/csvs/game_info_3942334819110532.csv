Zoe Beta,"Zoe for Oculus Quest is a learning platform letting you design, visually program, and play your own interactive experiences all within your headset. Setting up your environment is easy: you can select from a variety of backgrounds, then drag and drop the models you want from the included 3D library. You can resize, rotate and place each model in your scene, and decide whether they are static or can be grabbed, are influenced by gravity... Once you are set you can bring your environment to live using Zoe's interactive system. Program a full experience using an intuitive set of customizable conditions and actions. And of course, you can play it at any time. Have learning about how to create unique interactive experiences !",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Art/Creativity, Educational",English,0.6.3,Zoe Immersive,"apelab, Inc.",https://www.zoe.com/,"Jan 29, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3942334819110532/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3942334819110532&r=1, https://www.zoe.com/privacy-policy/",Terms of Service,1.45 GB,"I love this app, it just needs more content. I'm still stuck decorating a house that I can not finishðŸ˜Ÿ please update, I miss playing.","this is a good program but there are bugs , i was wating for the next update but non came, there are bugs such as things only working once and such, it has no real guide on how to do things .and vary limited tools, once there is more it could be 10/10 amazing but till then it is not much more then a sad thing",This used to be my favourite app of all time! Not even paid apps matched up to it. This new update is absolutely terrible!!! The quality and performance has WORSENED!! The headset already doesnâ€™t have the best visual quality and now this?? The poly look was great everything was sharper and brighter. And I lost all my hard work on my old projects!!! Iâ€™m so upset! I canâ€™t believe you!,"All Iâ€™ve been able to achieve is smacking a bear and it rotating and shrinking while screaming. The interactions (basically the scenes logic) applies only to 1 object, and you canâ€™t set the interaction to all objects of a certain type (bear), and the interaction can only happen once, so you have to create a new interaction for every time youâ€™d use it (no loops at all). There isnâ€™t even a way to copy interactions, or even delete an action in it, so if you create one you donâ€™t want, youâ€™ll have to delete the whole interaction and recreate it. Your hands arenâ€™t objects, you have no buttons other than grab, there arenâ€™t many actions and the ones that are there are extremely basic (you canâ€™t set something to a variable or make something spawn something or make loops for example). The idea is really cool, like Dreams in and for VR, but itâ€™s not capable of much more than 1 screaming bear.","I can see the potential but you're gonna need a lot more programming options to make interesting interactions. Also first users need to land on the example scene at first launch otherwise first experience is not good with empty scene. I think you should have more examples and a community tab where people can share their scenes easily. Also I tried to make a language practice scene, but your keyboard needs support for other language characters too."
