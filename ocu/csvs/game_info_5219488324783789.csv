The true freedom of movement here is unmatched - run, jump, dash, grapple; it's your playground - and I really mean it! The co-op feature takes it to another level. Battling endless enemies with a friend is so much fun, and the interplay between the classes (Warrior, Rogue, Vanguard) is masterfully crafted. And you can see that there was a LOT of love for details in every aspect, whether it's about the lore, upgrades or overall design. I personally adore the Rogue - zipping around, causing havoc is incredibly satisfying :D The progression system adds the cherry on top, offering loads of skills and weapons to unlock and upgrade. It's the kind of game that keeps you coming back for more, just to see what else you can do. EVERSLAUGHT Invasion stands tall in the VR landscape. It's thrilling, fast-paced, and hands-down a must-play. This isn't just another VR game; it's a redefinition of the genre and the kind of game that we have been waiting for! Thanks to the dev team which dared to take on this monster of a project to spark a change in this genre!!","This game is not like any other, fast paced, violent, and full of surprises. Three separate classes that offer variety in gameplay, and levels that will keep you on your toes. You will break a sweat while playing this game, but you also just might break your sanity among the unrelenting hordes in this nightmare fueled world. In all seriousness, this game is something truly special, if you enjoy high-octane melee and gunplay, this is the game for you!","Knowing Everslaught since it's first release on Steam and knowing that has been put on hold for a Quest spin-off, that's the Invasion at the end, I was cautiosly optimistic. The PC version is a ton of fun so that version should be too, right... right? The overall gameplay feels not really satisfying. You're in an arena and just hacking at wave after wave. Uninspired and yes I have to refer again to the PC version again, that has a way tighter and more fun gameplay. Even the presantation felt way more epic there. This is just your run of the mill meele hack and slay wave game. Presentation wise you see it's on a mobile chip. They did a good job for that but with the name everSLAUGHT there needs to be way more blood when hitting and slashing enemies. Feels like a pg version where the blood was removed. The air ship is neat tho.","I don't usually play standalone games but for the first time I will make an exception. The game feels like those old school arcade fighting games where you buff yourself during the battle. Very good mechanics, very addictive as well. This is action packed, fast paced, you really need space to play this game, just keep your Ming dynasty vases away, there's a point that you are so immersed into the fight that you forget what's around you. Just get the game. Best Quest game out.","Everslaught Invasion looks great on paper, and the trailers had us really excited, but is essentially a disappointing experience. The shield is tricky to deploy, you cannot parry with your sword or weapons. The collision detection isn't very good, and, perhaps worst of all, wiggling your sword or axe at the enemies has just about the same effect as hacking away at full strength, giving you very little incentive to play it as a real fighter. The maps are well designed, but the sub-missions that you have to play before you reach the end; one consisting of lighting lanterns around the level, and one consisting of destroying totems, are mind-numbingly boring interludes, and they repeat with every map, every level. The multiplayer is somewhat broken. Sure, you can play with a friend, but the game doesn't even include any voice chat functionality, so you can't plan things together unless you're already in a Meta Party to begin with. Also, despite being marketed as a co-op experience, the game doesn't really require players to have each other's backs or cooperate in any meaningful way. You just both happen to be playing the same map together. The grappling hook is cool, the lack of weapon parrying and the lack of weapon physicality is not. These issues, along with the disappointing multiplayer aspect makes it hard to recommend. For a full review, search YouTube for our 6DOF Reviews channel, or just type 6DOF Reviews Everslaught."
