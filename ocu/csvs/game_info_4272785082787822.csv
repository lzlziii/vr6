Frenzy VR,"Frenzy VR is a game full of mayhem and destruction. You are placed inside carefully constructed environments where you can go mad and be free to do what you please in a world without consequences. A VR game where all objects can be a weapon, with the added bonus of having satisfying destruction physics. Ever dreamed of hitting your best friend in the face with a toaster? Probably not, but now I mentioned it I bet you want to try it! Frenzy VR is great for stress relief, anger management, and of course just having a bit of fun!",12+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Fighting, Shooter",English,"58

Going into the game I thought that the physics were phenomenal and very fun to mess around with. There is a wide variety of weapons to use and they work perfectly. The story is well done and the maps are awesome. I am excited for the next update. If you would like the code please privately message me. (Ask Nicely),It is so fun Throwing people into Tables and stuff! Now i can finaly get my rage out when i get angry! And i like how almost everything is breakeble. Many levels but i hope it will come more levels and Weapons. And in the New levels it would be cool to add cars you can drive! And a new boss would be cool! And multiplayer would make this game the best game ever. One more thing... ROCKET LAUNCHERS!!!!!!!!! But frenzy vr is the best ragdoll game ive played.,It’s like killing people without facing trial it was such a hassle getting out of death row after killing 24 people and the story was great but I wish the graphics were realistic to feed my satisfaction of murder overal it’s great ps add a school and more Childen Friend me and I’ll give you the link,"Go to bit PERIOD ly / Biastes to find deals on tons of oculus games including this one (remove the spaces and replace the PERIOD with a .)
