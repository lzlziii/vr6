Please make an option to add multiple models to one project! Ok, a lot of people have been asking this. You need any oculus link cable, a pc, and a vrm model. You can make a vrm model in Vroid studio. You don’t need a vr ready pc to do this. Connect the headset and pc with the cable. Go into the quest drive and go to the Play Animaker file. Go to models and copy and paste your .vrm model. RENAME IT “My Character”. Or else it won’t work. Go into the game and import model. Boom shot got it.","After the title screen, it doesn't do anything, all it is is darkness, I tried deleting it and reinstalling it, waiting for so long that my headset died, please fix this if you can (╥﹏╥)"
