Language Lab,"Disclaimer: This is not your standard language learning app. It’s the CrossFit of language learning apps. If you need to see grammar instructions and want multiple choice exercises to tell you how good you are, there are other apps for that. If you prefer to see an alphabet written on a blackboard in order to learn pronunciation, there are other apps for that. We re-approached the language acquisition process from the ground up and created lessons that mimic the same learning process that we have all used while learning our first language. We built this because we were tired of spending years in classrooms, looking at alphabets and grammar written out in text books and hearing lectures from “experts” with “decades of teaching experience” before going to foreign countries and understanding next to nothing. We built this because we wanted to understand. We wanted to communicate with people from other cultures with other languages. If this sounds like you too, come join the revolution.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Social, Travel","English, English (Australia), English (UK), English (US), English (Canada), English (South Africa), Arabic, Chinese (China), Chinese (Taiwan), Dutch, Dutch (Belgium), French (Belgium), French (Canada), French (France), German, German (Switzerland), Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Russian, Russian (Ukraine), Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Venezuela), Ukrainian",0.11.78,LanguageLab VR,LanguageLab VR,https://www.languagelabvr.com/,"Oct 8, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3802077353226534/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3802077353226534&r=1, https://www.languagelabvr.com/privacy-policy",1.21 GB,"It was a great extracurricular tool for VR Language Learning as the games would give the students a bit of a brain break without removing the learning, but once the games got put behind the monthly pay-wall, it's just too much. If there was a one-time purchase for just the games, it'd be potentially doable, but not monthly.","It has a wonderful purpose, but with a lot of bugs and problems learning italian for exemple. Confratulations about your job, but, you should Take care about your user experience it is not good, many bugs, poor strategy, many mistakes, classes with no evolutivon...",It's a very nice app for children to learn English. But I have a suggestion that you should change the way you charge if you want more people to use your app. Monthly fees may deter many potential customers.,"This is the closest thing to the best language acquisition method ""comprehensible input"". I have over a decade of language teaching experience and it's frustrating to see the struggle of my students. We get used to teaching/learning a language by starting from pronunciation, grammar, reading text etc. It's very inefficient. Children acquire a new language by listening first, they guess and try and in the end they learn a new language much faster than adults. This app has huge potential. Thanks a lot to the developers! I look forward to your new addition. You're in the ABSOLUTELY RIGHT DIRECTION!","The idea of the program is great, I like it, Thank u"
