STRIDE,"Get ready for the ultimate rooftop experience! With STRIDE, you'll feel like a parkour pro as you soar from building to building, vault through windows, and slide down cables with lightning speed. With our smooth locomotion system, you'll be able to make quick decisions and feel the rush of speed with every movement. But the fun doesn't stop there! STRIDE features epic multiplayer modes like HORDE, where you'll avoid the clutches of zombie players or infect as many survivors as possible. In KING OF THE HILL, grab the crown and hold onto it for dear life. And, of course, we've got some sick gun action with DEATHMATCH, TDM, and CTF. And if you're looking for a solo adventure, we've got you covered too. In ENDLESS mode, you'll face infinite challenges as the level generation keeps you on your toes. ARENA is perfect for perfecting your parkour tricks and honing your shooting skills, while TIME RUN tests your speed and agility in a race against the clock. With so many options and the freedom to move like never before, STRIDE is the adrenaline-fueled adventure you've been waiting for!",16+,"Single User, Multiplayer",Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Arcade","English, Chinese (China), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Spain)",2.16.12,JoyWay Ltd,Joy Way,https://stride.joyway.games/,"Aug 5, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4901911359882668/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4901911359882668&r=1, https://stride.joyway.games/privacy-policy",Terms of Service,4.39 GB,"Okay so, if you were looking around the internet and you see a parkour game called STRIDE and you saw something called FATES keep in mind, at the end of most FATES trailers it says 2023 at the current moment we don’t know when FATES will come out, but, we do know it’s sometime this year, FATES isn’t out yet, and I can’t wait for it. So the closest thing you have to that is Arena mode, watch some YouTube videos on that and then decide if you want to purchase. (The following is for the devs) Add more challenges to Arena, it’s just boring at the moment and could use some type of update. Add multiplayer Endless. Make it where you can see yourself when you look down, like a body, arms, feet, just where you can see yourself. Finally please don’t release FATES at 11:59 December 31st… just don’t.","This game was GODLIKE on its release, the single player gameplay was, and still is, amazing. Sure, like other games, it had some bugs on release, but those were all patched soon after. The issue became a thing with the multi-player. You see, when the multi-player was released, it really got the gears moving for what could've been a great Multi-player game mode. However, the multi-player has plenty of issues in it, sliding is terrible, and it's dead now too. It could take forever for you to find a lobby. The Multi-player is also really flooded with kids, and this game isn't exactly meant for kids. However, there isn't really anything you can do about that. Or is there...? Looking at it being at a glass half full point of view, the game having kids in it could be a good thing for the child's health. This game could be a good way to get the kid exercising a bit and get their body moving. Now, looking at it from a glass half empty point of view, the number of children on a platform, that is really meant for teens and adults, could be annoying to those of more mature ages. So I'd suggest, for Multi-player, have the player enter their age, and then place the player into a lobby with people in their age group. This way, the adults are separated from children. This would not only help keep kids safer from potentially dangerous strangers online but also preserve the environment for adults to have fun in too. All in all, it's a good game, but the multi-player could really use some tweaking. You folks are doing great with this game, truly, and I hope this idea gets implemented as it truly will help.","You get what you see. A very fun parkour game, the only things I had issues with was with wall running, which after a bit more practice I mastered the mechanic. The only other bad thing is the fact that most of the time I can’t really get into online lobbies cause I don’t see many people playing anymore. But that’s a very slight downside when all the single player stuff is as fun and addictive as it is. An amazing game I haven’t gotten tired of and can’t imagine getting tired of. Definitely a steal.",I had stride for 1 year now and i always wanted to have a story but when i saw the STRIDE FATES news i was happy when i first see it and i put my email in it i couldn't know what happened to it but a few days later i was very late to the party of it and i was not surprized about it and it may take few months or next year -_- but the game itself was fun tho,"The game mychanics are great, but the maximum amount of players I saw in a lobby, was 8. You can't even play multiplayer game modes with more then 1 player and you! Edit: Thank you for responding, you just earned another 5 stars!"
