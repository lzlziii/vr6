It absolutely blew my mind and allowed me to grow my VR feet. This game is outrageous. The heights you soar to, the complexity of the levels as you progress. The immensity of the action as you hop around imaginative edifices up down and sideways can be overwhelming, and you may get nauseated along the way unlike a game like Swarm for example. I got over any and all nausea as I processed forward, and I was new to VR then. This plays parkour but not like stride. You have to stretch your flexible robot arms to designated areas to proceed, much like teleporting. However, when you release your grip from the designated area you rebound to great heights, depending on your angle, distance and speed. The graphics are minimal which makes them surreal and I love that. This is a VR classic that I can‚Äôt recommend enough. Now take this spamming! Take it! Take my spam!

L I N K T R , E E / D I S C O U N T F U R Y","I may be biased because I speedrun this game, but I do it for a reason. Genuinely a really fun game, especially once you get on the leaderboards. The controls aren't like any other VR game out there I know of, really unique experience. Highly recommend üëç",I love The Climb 2 and I got this for this reason. But this is so FAR from it... I just played for a while and never again.,"Climbing platformers are inherently the most immersive genre of VR game. To The Top is no exception. The graphics are simple but clean and sharp, the worlds are vast and creatively designed, action and physics are mostly smooth. Personally, I'm not a fan of the music in the game, but thankfully audio doesn't seem necessary to game progression, so it's the perfect game to play when you want to listen to your own music on headphones. There is a lot of content in TTT, and some good replay value as it appears there are three main goals in each level: Grab all the green gems, grab the hidden items (I'm not sure I've encountered any of those yet so I don't know what they look like), and try to beat the 3 target times. I love that one can complete these achievements gradually, and come back to any level at any time to work on progressively collecting items or bearing the speed run times. Areas for improvement: 1) The method for moving from one area to another is to grab, release, look to your new destination and grab again. While this is an undeniably fun and unique approach, it takes away from the immersive nature of the game because it's simply not intuitive or natural. Would it be possible to add a ""natural"" option of locomotion that uses a grab, release, and pull/swing your arms to get you to your next spot, a la the GT model? That way players could choose between the two. 2) You can't grab just anywhere on a given blue surface. There are only a few pre-determined configurations of where your hands can latch onto a surface - There is no scale gradient here. If you move your hand position in between, it will automatically lock into one of the preset positions. While this doesn't seem to affect gameplay, it's similar to snap turning vs smooth locomotion - it seems janky and is less immersive. It reminds me that I'm in a game. Would it be possible to add ""smooth"" hand placement? 3) When I've missed the mark and fallen to my death between buildings, I get transported back to the last checkpoint. Perfect! However, when I miss my grab and end up landing on a flat surface with no blue grabby stuff within reach, I'm stuck infinitely. I have no choice but to restart the level from the console on my left wrist. But when I restart manually, I have to return to the very beginning. This makes no sense to me. Why not respawn at the most recent checkpoint? There should definitely be the option to restart the level from the beginning for speedrun purposes, but why don't the checkpoints come into play when the player gets stuck? Seems inconsistent. Overall this game is fantastic, and I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible. Devs, please consider making a few changes (especially #3 above) to enhance gameplay on what is already a fun, immersive experience.","It‚Äôs a fantastic game, and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably better than Beat Saber and Super Hot. If I‚Äôm in the mood for VR, this is the first app I boot up!"
