Y‚Äôall slapped a $20 label on the game just for some updated graphics a few new weapons and some a game progression. The least y‚Äôall could do is let everyone who had the game before the full version came out have it for free,"This game has been out for a long time. The built in mods make the game 100x better. Even though you‚Äôre game can crash from some mods it will work on the second time. So whoever wrote a bad review has not unlocked mods yet. (How to get mods, 1. Jump off the bridge 5-6 times. 2. Check your right hand and you will see a yellow dot. Click that. 3. Click the MODS button to see mods. I hope this helps :) )","The game itself is amazing and the gameplay is immersive, although there is a point in my experience where every time I try to load into the game it softlocks into the skybox refusing to let me play. It shows the unity logo, then bam, stuck in the skybox. I‚Äôve tried waiting, uninstalling and installing, yet nothing works. Can you help with this?","I have literally been sucked into this game. Every time I put my headset on I straight away go to Battle Talent (Demo). I love going through all the dungeons fighting my way through tiny goblins with bombs and maces, normal goblins with maces and swords, skeletons with any weapon you can think of, dark elves suited with armor, and my favorite boss to fight; The tall, red - eyed, dual wielding goblin. This game gives very great parkour and challenges it‚Äôs very addictive. I really thank the creator for coming up with this game. I don‚Äôt know what I would play without it.","I really enjoy this game. It's really good just as a demo, and I probably won't buy the full game, you can use mods in the demo and use it infinitely play it. Would play"
