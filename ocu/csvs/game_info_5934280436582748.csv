We just need some more people to join and then it will not just be a wonderful one but maybe full of wonder enjoyable with out a doubt and can also be replacing the daily workout and if that is something you usually do then you should definitely consider this and you'll be surprised..!..üëåüî•üëç,"This is the perfect experience for all of you who are looking for a competitive vr ball game! The concept is simple but brilliant, and everything is made to the highest standards! An absolute pleasure. üëèüèª (Oh and it‚Äôs free !!)","This is the most fun I've had in VR for a while. The concept is easy to pick up and understand. There's cosmetics, change your gloves, face and chest along with the arena and other things. It's constantly being updated, I love the flow of controls and menu items now. The locker room feels more like a room than a small space on the wall. Each update is an improvement. You'll be sweating, but you'll have a blast. The announcer isn't dull. They can add a few more voice lines, but ""Abra Kadabra"" always cracks me up. I'm looking forward to the full release! It's also free to play!!!","This game was very meh around a month ago, but since then, there has been an update that fixed a lot of issues and added power shots. This game is amazing and has a dedicated developer team, especially for being free to play.",It's a pretty good game you should definitely try it out because it's free you'll definitely swell a lot for sure and it has you moving around a lot and a small space so if you don't mind motion sickness it's a really good game to play for online
