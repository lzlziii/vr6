I forgot to update my review, the game is amazing and is definitely worth every cent after resolving the issue.",yes,"I have been djing for 15 years starting with the exact setup as in Vinyl Reality. Recreating this exact experience in VR is nothing short of incredible. If you have or have been spinning records just get this, you won’t regret it.","I haven’t had any previous dj experiences, but after using this app for a couple hours I can say I’ve created some sick mixes and actually find myself loving my own mixes instead of cringing. It is a great app to experiment different songs and techniques. It is also visually appealing. It’s very fun and great to use.","I just tried this free app for about 1 hour and I have to say, I am amazed by the quality and realistic way it works! I have to admit, that I am really new to VR, having bought my first VR set (Quest 2) just 7 days ago, but I have been DJing for 40 years now, using the SL 1200's and this looks and feels almost like the real thing. I still struggle with letting go of the record and it being in synch with the other record right away, like I'm used to with real decks, but that is just a matter of more experience with the controllers. The way you found a way of using the PFL by tapping the side is something, I really like! I also love how you can adjust the turntables and mixer settings, like IRL (fader curves, stop speed, etc) Unfortunately,I did not see a way of using my own MP3 collection, since I couldn't access Air Link with this free version, but since it was a test, the records that were supplied were ok to use. I was completely awe struck, when I read you are able to upload and use your own slip mat design! In that case, something I loke to see (as a Hip Hop DJ) would be the option to put the turntables in the so called ""battle mode"" (i.e. side ways, so they are closer together, next to the mixer) or even next to each other and the mixer on either the left or right side. :) I think I need to buy the PC version to use my own collection, so I will do this and see how I can perhaps start to use it for live streaming as well. :) Cheers, from DJ Bite, Amsterdam, The Netherlands"
