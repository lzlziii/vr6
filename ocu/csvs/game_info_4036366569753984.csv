Agority VR Space,"Spinview’s Agority platform helps you immerse your team, your clients and stakeholders in a real-world environment for effective and engaging meetings without them leaving their desks, let alone their city. The key benefit is the combination of the flexibility of online collaboration with the interactivity of face-to-face meetings for more satisfying and effective working. Features of the app include sharing presentations and video, creating bespoke surveys with real time results and more. You can design a space appropriate to the meeting so up to 8 people can focus and communicate with each-other in any environment you choose - from the Agority lobby to a tropical rainforest. Agority helps you create a workspace designed to encourage a culture of sharing without the cost and time taken to get people physically in the same office. We exist to share the power of our technology with everyone and we’d love to hear from you.",12+,Multiplayer,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Productivity, Social",English,1.1,Spinview Global Limited,Spinview Global Limited,https://agority.app/index.html,"Jan 24, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4036366569753984/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4036366569753984&r=1, https://agority.app/privacy-policy.html",Terms of Service,546.3 MB,Boring!
