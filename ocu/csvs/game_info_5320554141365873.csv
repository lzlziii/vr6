Snowboard Funpark,"Riding a snowborad in virtual reality is fun, but doing tricks on ramps, rails and curbs is addicting. With our physics-based approach, we managed to create an experience that every snowboarder will instantly feel familiar with. The board can be oriented by swinging the arms to gain momentum. The orientation of the hands determine the angle relative to the hill, that is used to decide if the board follows a direction or not. Just like a real snowboard. When approaching a rail or curb the snowboarder will keep his spinning momentum due to the low friction on the rails or curbs material, the same is true for air-time, what allows you to do spins on rails, curbs or in air-time. Gameplay • Level System (only one level at the moment) • Score System • To-Do-List for each map • Map - ""Mount Pee Pee"" • Map - ""Ski-Hall"" • Map - ""City Spot"" • Freestyle-Mode • Recording and Reviewing • Board Editor • [upcoming] Mini Challenges",3+,单人,立式,Touch 控制器,Quest、Quest 2、Meta Quest Pro,、模拟,英语,0.1.5,YueWorks,YueWorks,https://yue-beifong.jimdosite.com/,2022年6月19日,隐私权政策,483.3MB,https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5320554141365873/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&locale=zh-cn&store&item_id=5320554141365873&r=1,This games is soooo good my fav vr game,If I could have three things in this -2 new maps( jump line) Rail jam/slope style - board flex for butters and nose and tail presses - challenges/ multiplayer sessions Highly recommend game,Needs a lots of work but still its fun and would be better if there was more options,I love this game it is very fun it needs some work but overall it’s awesome. I with they would add more maps tho,"This game is very fun, and I feel like if more stuff was added, such as maps, game modes, etc, it could succeed very well."
