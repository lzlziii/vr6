Everything Has Arms,"It's hide-and-seek on steroids in VR. And everything has arms! Hunters are looking for the heavily ""armed"" items in this multiplayer VR prop-hunt game. As mimic you blend in and fool the hunters, high-fiving other mimics for victory. Hunters need to find and catch the flexing flower pots in this fast-paced hide and seek game. Everything has arms in Everything Has Arms. In Everything has Arms you either take on the role of a Hunter or become a Mimic. Mimics can disguise themselves by possessing objects and hide as them. Score by high-fiving other mimics and staying in the game as long as possible. As soon as the hunters spot you, you need to bolt and lose them before they catch you. Hunters need to find and chase down the Mimics. Their finger guns will slow them down and hinder their jumping ability.",3+,Multiplayer,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Shooter, Social",English,0.16,Holocafe,Holocafe,https://everythinghasarms.com/,"Aug 9, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5540628439290318/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5540628439290318&r=1, https://everythinghasarms.com/privacy",Terms of Service,307.5 MB,Server Do not work,Miss this game,THIS GAME IS TRULY AMAZING IT CHANGED MY LIFE LITERALLY AS GOOD AS GORILLA TAG,It’s fine when I’m in the lobby when I first joined but when I go to play games as soon as I give the handle hi5 it starts freezing up and every like two seconds it freezes and I can’t get it to work so please try to fix thank you or give me some advice,"Unlike all the spam on sidequest, it's not a clone/copy, but a pretty impressive showing on the genre.
