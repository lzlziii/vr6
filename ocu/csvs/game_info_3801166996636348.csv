Not easy. Funny and enjoyable, beautiful graphics and music. Reminds me of classic retro Raiders, or Galaxian, but VR makes it way different. I got the PC version and this is the same but wireless.","I was thinking Space Pirates with fantasy elements, and then I kept playing. Way more depth and atmosphere than Space Pirates. I love the enemy character models, so detailed up close. Really great job people!"
