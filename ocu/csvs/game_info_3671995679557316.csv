When I launch the game, the left side of my view is strobing black and white and I can't do anything",Display not working correctly with half of the player's vision blacked out.,REAL WAY & PRACTICE RESPECT&GRATITUDES to ****** BLIND LADY ****** ******,A very unique concept for a creative game. I like the precision needed for slices you really have to be on point and unlike some games you not just gonna be swinging around like crazy. I did feel that when swinging it felt a little stiff I couldn’t quite flick my wrist to get those nice yuck swings. It almost felt like I was using a two handed weapon with the stiffness of it. I was curious if the sheath in your other hand will serve a purpose. Maybe it does and I just haven’t figured out yet what. It is lacking with some type of tutorial but I don’t expect one for a incomplete game. Maybe add some different scenes like I thought a darker environment would make you feel like you we’re actually blind. I love the sound but it would be cool if you could hear where your next opponent may be coming from. Also not sure if it’s not complete but one of the modes would crash the game I believe it was the option all the way to the right can’t recall what it was called. All in all I think this is a very good start to a good sword game that actually requires your full attention rather then just going swing crazy. Ps I love your guys logo at the beginning of the game I could look at the ninja dog all day it is very cool IMO,"this is the first VR game I have disliked. it seems cool, and I'm sure it works perfectly fine for most players, but as a left handed person, I struggled with it. and unless there is an option somewhere that I missed, there is no way to hold the sword left handed."
