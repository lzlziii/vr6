This zombie shooting game puts you above the hoard. The zombies can’t touch you but they can still kill you with things they throw at you Teleporting from tower to tower takes a little getting used to but you’ll learn fast when that dynamite is thrown at you. Added bonus is the ability to play with up to 8 friends in CoOp mode.,"This game is great. I loved Elven Assassins! This adds quite a lot for being so similar. It's still being worked on, but it's already so good. I haven't played much, but just somethings I saw right off the cuff. I don't like that I can turn with the joy stick, it really messes me up when I'm trying to jump from one tower to another, especially when I'm under pressure. I'd like to be able to rearrange my guns, but this could just take me getting used to it. The grip isn't the best. when loading the grenade launcher I have to try a couple of times to close the barrel. It would be awesome if I could flick it closed like they do in the movies. Grip issue with the bullets in rifle and shotgun. It's probably because I'm going so fast, but it's frustrating when the zombies are coming and my reload is messing up, but maybe that's what you want, to have that careful precision be more like a real life zombie attack. I haven't played all the levels, but I hope to see a mission level where you're on a train defending it from zombies on horses, that would be fun. I'd also like to see smaller levels, for 2 or 4 players where you're defending a saloon, but that doesn't seem to be what you're going for and that's ok. The game is really great and has wonderful potential. It's worth every penny, right now, if you don't change or fix a thing. Thanks.","This is a very satisfying game! It's not a horror survival, but it grows on you, and it's quickly become my most played game. Protecting the town by shooting the zombies is deeply satisfying. If you shoot their legs they can't throw the dynamite at you! I don't necessarily need a sight on every gun, but I agree with others that the pistols are hard to aim - even for this Texan. You get all the guns at the start, and although you do have to load them, you don't have to go through all that 'upgrade to a better gun' mess. I've introduced at least six friends to this game and everyone got the basics within a few waves. And there is a real heart-pounding intensity when the hoard gets right up to the gate and you are the last one alive and desperate to make each shot count. And the community (which is just starting to grow) in multiplayer games is friendly, helpful, welcoming, and sometimes super funny. I personally have not found any major glitches on Quest2.","Comments on aiming ability and use: Can’t see where the shot is going to land with hand guns. Learning curve with shot guns. No instructions on how to use. A lot of “ figure it out on your own” Bow and arrow is awkward and not as refined as in Elven Assassin. You have to hold it away from your body and out some to shoot. Not very comfortable. Glitch: Two players in a private room. When room is supposed to load, it kicks you back to the fire menu.",Very fun to play with different weapons and more beautiful graphics. Love this cool genre of vr game - Manual Tower Defense.
