Be Your Best,"With access to hundreds of moments from professional games, you take to the virtual pitch, putting yourself in the boots of one 11 aside player. Scan the pitch at the right moments, make the correct passing decisions, and react to regular awareness tests, as you work to improve your vision by replicating situations from real games. Whether you're looking to fit in more training hours from home, stay sharp when injured, or gain an advantage going into your next game, Be Your Best is designed for all players, both professional and amateur. Be Your Best is a professional training tool and not a game. Improving your performance takes consistent practice and dedication over time.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Educational, Simulation, Sports",English,2.9.8,Be Your Best,Be Your Best,https://www.beyourbest.com/,"Mar 9, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5105468496138399/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5105468496138399&r=1, https://www.beyourbest.com/privacy",Terms of Service,990.3 MB,"Good training tool but completely overpriced. It’s so poorly optimized so you lag the whole time and they claim they are working to add updates etc but they update like once every 3 months. Match play is unusable it’s getting like 20 fps and there is no tactical understanding from the ai so it’s pretty much just ball chasing the entire 5 minutes and there’s no replay for it, calling for a pass doesn’t work. Maybe they could get more purchases by charging a time fee instead of a subscription and in turn would get more money to put towards development","I saw the advertisements for this game while looking up scanning on Youtube. After a week of use, My vision and awareness in practice and in matches allows me so much more time to find a teammate or dribble into space. Using the app right before a match had my head on a swivel the whole game and put me into the right mind state to perform at my best. The BeYourBest team is very responsive and I look forward to using the app everyday.",I hate this game because every time I sign in it never works my friends even has a vr and tried it never worked and my family share the vr and they have problems with it is there a way to fix it?,"Such an amazing game! If you keep practicing regularly, just a few minutes of full focus every day, you will feel the difference on the „real“ soccer field quickly. They’ve also been developing the game consistently and I’m sure it will be even more incredible and more realistic in a short time.","My son (2011) plays competitive soccer and is loving the Be Your Best Pro app. It has improved his scanning on the field and field/game awareness. He is still in the learning process with the soccer IQ app, but he loves the different competitive scenarios it provides including leveling up as he achieves higher scores."
