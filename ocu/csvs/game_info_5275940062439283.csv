So strange; I didn't uninstall and reinstall it a second time. Most importantly, all's well for now; I'm bumping up the review to 4 stars. I can't wait to explore more. One problem that I have noticed is that when activating the haptics on the jump function in one of the levels (kind of strange that it's not just a setting to toggle), the graphics became blurry. It was almost like looking through old school 3d glasses. All of a sudden, everything had a shadow above and a shadow below it. I also don't really understand the point of the app. All of the destinations in the space worlds are seemingly very easy to find. UPDATE: Randomly, the locomotion finally starting working properly. We'll see if it continues to work normally during my next play. There are some great ideas here with some lackluster execution. The gravity is far too strong. It's almost comical. While it may conveniently fit the content of the storyline, it completely detracts from the wow factor of the gameplay. It makes no sense that the gravity is many times greater than Earth's, yet the character can jump hundreds of feet into the air incredibly rapidly. Simply fixing the jump function and normalizing gravity would go a long way to improve the experience. The sheer scale of everything is amazing and vast! I want to see more. I downloaded this with high hopes but the game is currently unplayable. I can't move forward into unobstructed areas, but can somehow move through walls. The movement is completely broken. Jumping launches me downward into the floor, from which I stutter back up into my original position. I uninstalled and reinstalled, and not only did the problem persist, but my progress had been saved from before the reinstall, leaving me stuck."
