Rainbow Reactor: Fusion offers a cozy and accessible VR experience in a single-player campaign puzzler. Keep the reactor from exploding and have a bunch of fun while doing it. 5/5 in my opinion - this game is wholesome, quirky, and worthy of a spot in your library.",Where in gods name do you find the water for the steam gun? I have been looking for days and I know it’s so simple because she tells me I should know where it is and I don’t. So can somebody please help me ￼,"I 've got so much game with my Quest, i 've never pay attention for this game. But today 21/12/2022 I decided to try it, what a great surprise, i really love it. I Hope devs don't give up this game and still update it","I really enjoyed this game, it felt like playing bust-a-move/Puzzle Bobble but better. The later levels offer more challenge meaning you won't breeze through them on your first try, probably. If you get frustrated and want to walk away from a level for a bit there are areas that need cleaning which sounds boring and probably is to a lot of people but I found upgrading to the better equipment to be a fun distraction from the main objective of the game. I've played 80+ games on the Q2 since getting it about eight months ago and I would place this game in my top ten, definitely recommend it to anyone.","Very good, but underrated game. I enjoy the well made story, the environment, the puzzles and the match 3 game with throwing balls. It deserves more attention."
