Tales of Tsynara,"Become the wizard you always wanted to be. Be the champion of Tsynara, an ancient place created by powerful wizards. They used the key elements of nature: Fire, Water and Air to keep everything uncorrupted and in balance among the realms. Until, fallen mage Aldern unleashed a cataclysmic spell, binding the planes in his own chains of energy . Now, as being the prodigy of Tsynara, travel through the fire plane, collect spells and face the minions of Aldern. An original approach for playing a mage character like no other. Fly for exploring, cast spells from each of your hand for eliminating. You will feel the true nature of this notorious plane and lose track of reality. Explore the corrupted Fire plane controlled by this evil mage's lords and dragons. Face the dragon and feel the real mayhem in it.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, RPG (Role Playing Games)",English,1.6,Beren Studio,Beren Studio,https://tsynara.com/,"Jul 11, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6280284645358464/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=6280284645358464&r=1, https://www.tsynara.com/privacy",831.5 MB,"You get to fly. You get to use magic. You get to fight demons. And I hear there is a dragon. What more can you ask for? Having to hold the grip button to fly feels strange, but I guess it is one of those things that you can get used to. Personally I would prefer a bigger play area, with alternative paths to take. On the other hand, I've only reached stage two, so I don't know what lies ahead. For some reason the game made me think of Space Harrier that I played when I was young.","The graphics and magic shooting system were so good. But it was little bit hard for me to go through. The life and magic guage on my wrist and hand is nice idea but it was hard to check during battle. And If my flares were shot from wands not bare hands, targeting could be more clear and intuitive.","I particularly like the concept of a flying mage casting spells to slay monsters. It's a good base, I look forward to future updates."
