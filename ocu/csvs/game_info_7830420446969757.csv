Polysketch,"The ultimate low poly 3D modeling tool! Sketch out your lines and surfaces like drawing on paper, then use a few key tools to add color, detail and modify. Simple, intuitive tools keep you focused and creative - then export a clean, game-ready mesh for prototypes, 3D printing, or just getting creative from the couch. We've found Polysketch is great for: ~Game dev and prototyping (Unity, Unreal, etc) ~Custom objects and worlds in VR Chat and Roblox ~Tabletop game creatures and props, to be 3D printed ~Concept art paintovers Instead of many complex tools, Polysketch focuses on simple, natural 3D sketching to create your shapes. It's like paper, but simpler because you don't have to learn perspective ;) You can export your creations as standard ""OBJ"" files for use in almost any app (Unity, Blender, etc). Even better, the line-sketching method ensures a clean and game-ready 3D mesh, so you can use it right away!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Art/Creativity, Productivity, Utility",English,"0.48

I got to try this for free as a tester, because of how early in development it is.. but i ended up buying it like half an hour into trying it. I was blown away, it's just so good! I want it to succeed! It turns 3d modelling into something simple, way less complex than your traditional modeling software like blender, 3ds max and the like. What you make in it can be exported for use as a 3d model in any software that takes 3d models! So like 3d printers, software like blender, game engines, you name it. The workflow is nice and intuitive. You basically draw the outline of a shape, then either start creating 3d outline drawings of it (like drawing a cube on paper), or extrude (it's like taking a surface and extending it. it'll make sense when you see it in action). You can set colors per thing you draw, so you can quickly make models with lots of different colors in them, without having to worry about textures. It reminds me of LittleBigPlanet and Dreams, two games by MediaMolecule that were known for their intuitive creation tools and the many amazing creations made in them. Dreams also took 3d modeling and made it simple and intuitive, in a different way. This could EASILY become the next tiltbrush, gravity sketch, or even rival big 3d creation software like Blender as well as creative games like Dreams and LBP that make 3d creation fun. It's a shame it's so unknown yet, it deserves a way bigger audience, and i hope it ends up on the main quest store someday! Dev, you've struck gold with the intuitiveness and simplicity. Please don't let feature requests bog that down, keep it nice, simple, and intuitive, but better and better at what it does!","Polysketch is a great pickup-and-go app to create 3D models in VR. The interface is fairly intuitive, and the overall presentation is pretty straightforward and user-friendly. Also, the developers have been responsive on their Discord and social media like Twitter and Reddit, and they've been quick to integrate feedback into each software revision. I've been amazed at how easily I've been able to generate objects (stylized for sure due to the low-poly nature, which lends itself to sketches/concepts), and how genuinely fun it is to just sit on the couch and create stuff from scratch. It's like doodling in my sketchbook, but in 3D *and* VR. Really good stuff!","I've been waiting for an app like this for years. There are numerous good apps focused on scultping in VR like Medium, SculptrVR, Shapelab, Substance 3D Modeler, etc. But for less organic shapes or game assets (low poly) 'polygon modeling' is the first choice and that's exactly what Polysketch offers in the easiest way I've ever seen in a 3D modeling software (and I know a lot like 3ds Max, Maya, Blender). With Polysketch I was able to design simple game assets after just half an hour of training! I also think it's brilliant that the mesh doesn't have to be composed of quads or triangles! It is enough to draw/connect 'ANY POLYGONS' and the mesh will be generated automatically. I hope the app will be officially approved in the store soon! Unfortunately, innovative apps are still rare here.","Great tool, I enjoy working in 3D Space sometimes to brainstorm. Considering this is in Alpha its already a great start. The only thing it is missing in my opinion is more drawing tools, and some underlying tools to detect face generation when attaching new faces to existing faces. I get that its mostly for modelling, but some people are going to want that simple line drawing or pencil writing type feel. Maybe add menu for line drawing. Since Tilt Brush has been made open source, maybe you can use some of their ""tools""? Regardless... I will be utilizing this for my meshes when in VR. Awesome! Worth the price","I found this so basic it's actually quite unusable for any real modeling task. I get it that it's in beta but TBH asking for $ for this, at its current state, is not justified in my opinion. This should have been an open beta for gathering thoughts from users."
