Not only does it have a unique aesthetic that sets it apart from other games, the fact that it was created by a one to two-person dev team makes it even more impressive! The game features progressive difficulty, a decent tutorial, and a good variety of enemies to fight against. Players can level up incrementally, which improves their stats and makes them better equipped to take on the game's increasingly difficult challenges. TBH this game feels like a trippy fever dream version of classic wave-shooter arcade games I loved as a child and I mean that in the best way. It’s actually quite addictive the more difficult things get because you repeatedly try to top yourself while getting farther up the leaderboards. DTA has a great soundtrack and well-done voice acting, which helps to create an immersive atmosphere. Players can choose between teleporting or smooth movement, providing flexibility and accommodating different playstyles. One of the most compelling aspects of DTA is the dedication the game dev has for creating a rich and detailed lore that spans across multiple games and even future comic books. The game's world has secrets, hidden areas, and mysterious creatures that hint at a much larger story for the player to uncover. This suggests that there is a lot more to this world than what is seen in the game, and that players can expect to learn more about the game's expanded lore/universe in the future. Dream Tango Ascension is a VR game that has clearly been crafted with a lot of love and care. As a passion project, it is unlikely to be abandoned in a year like some other popular VR games. I will give it a 5/5 stars due to my appreciation of the aesthetics, difficulty, and consistent improvements made by a small dev team (got to show 'em some appreciation). If you’re a fan of wave-shooters, astral projection, spirituality, and virtual reality this is the game for you!","This game is BEAUTIFUL!!! I'm so in love with the graphics style. Visuals are stunning, music is perfect. Little Pallas is so freakin' adorable! I want him. Gameplay is good. I played on easy and died a few times. Some of the enemies are tricky. I played for about an hour and only unlocked 4 out of 56 achievements. This game will last a while!",This game is great if you are into the paranormal and know about the things that people encounter when they Astral project. The beings are wild looking and massive! Here is a link to my video review! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPttYVKgnrA,"The nature of the wave based shooter will keep you on your toes if you don't mind your surroundings. The designs, visuals and music are pleasant to look and listen too, with an interesting story tied to it. The hidden lore was worth finding to expand on the story as well. The game can certainly be challenging if you're on your toes and paying attention to everything around you! Take advantage of the different enemy types and how to deal with them, and clearing everything currently in the game is definitely possible. I can't wait to see what additions and challenges find their way in to later builds.","Hi, I just purchased this app. When I open it, evrerything is blank. All I hear is music but the screen is just black."
