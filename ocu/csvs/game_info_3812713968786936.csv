Hand Posing Tool: Pirates!,"This is a tech demo for: https://github.com/MephestoKhaan/HandPosing an Open-Source tool that allows to quickly author hand poses for grabbing objects in a realistic and solid way. Works with controllers and hand tracking. Download the Unity project: https://github.com/MephestoKhaan/HandPosing_Demo This demo is intended to become not just a collection of real-use examples for the tool, but a feedback and testing base from which to gather feedback and grow, creating a more useful tool for everyone. Get on board and grab all the different objects in this pirate ship to learn about the possibilities of the tool while having some fun, then get the Unity package and add quality grabs to your own project! FAQ: -Currently only smooth locomotion is supported with the controllers. You can experience the demo in room-scale. -The project is in active development! We hope to bring many improvements over the next months. -This project uses anonymous analytics regarding grabbing interactions.

With a little bit more updates it will probably be one of my favorite if not my favorite games to play.","Where do pirates get their Christmas gifts? ARRRGH-os! (Get it, like argos?, ar- just forget it.) Sorry for the cringe joke. This source tool is cool, more people should make different demos like this, or a full game with it. Like it alot, just like pirates like SHIP-ping their parcels from ARRRGH-os! (XD I'll stop now.)",Why do inde devs always make exactly what I am looking for. Please make it multiplayer and open world with islands and ports like sea of theives but in vr,"Loved the concept. But I found my hands would get 'left behind' when opening the door or trying to steer/spin the yoke. And when my hand wasn't stuck on the door, the door would somehow close half way like a screen door on a spring. The tracking was off once objects hit the ground. I wasn't really able to grab items again, at least not using hand tracking only. I never did figure out how to fire the cannon. I tried grabbing all of the candles and it never worked out for me. For some reason my playing area was much smaller than my guardian zone. That got irritating since I lost about 1'-2' all the way around. The trap door was neat, but to be fair I was hoping to do more with the cutlass at that point. The tracking on that was pretty off, and it seemed like I was constantly holding it at a weird angle. Took me about 4 tries to grab the cork for the bottle, and then couldn't get the message unraveled. If this were the spring board for another pirate themed game, I'd be 100% down, even to be a beta tester (blunderbuss, anyone?) Just give me an option shanry with some singing skulls at the for of the ship and I'm ready.","I'm impressed with this hand posing system that can work with both the controllers and the hand tracking. This is a pirate thing, it's just a short room, but it looks very good, and its fun."
