This is a very slow-paced game, like watching a TV drama/anime series. But it is exactly through this sort of slow-pace, laid-back gameplay that you really can start to feel for and connect with the characters. The characters are also proportioned right for a Japanese anime styled game and should cater well to western audiences even if you are not a weeb. Granted, I was a little disappointed at first that it is no longer about giant mechas like its predecessor, but heck, the world is very beautiful (although a little barren, but maybe that is the point) and characters are more believable. The music are also masterfully done and fits the scenes well (it gives me the vibe of an old PSP semi-visual novel game called Fate/Extra). One criticism I do have for the game is that it loads way too often between event/free roam transitions that would have been seamless on many other games. Although the loading time isn't long, seeing the loading circle frequently really breaks immersion. I hope this can be improved if their next game is still a VR visual novel. Oh and we desperately need to be able to interact with more of her parts when petting Lily. Even VRChat avatars have more touch-able parts! Don't lose to an SNS will ya (jk)! --- VRアドベンチャーとして大変素晴らしいと思う。ADVらしくかなりのスローペースでの展開だが、だからこそキャラ一人一人を知る時間たっぷりで、それぞれの魅力をじっくり味わえるのではないかと思う。まあ、ドラマやアニメが好きな方だったらそこに文句を言う輩はまず居ないでしょう。 最初は巨大ロボから脱却したことについてややがっかりではあったが、今作の世界自体が綺麗で（やや虚無さを感じるが、まぁそこも世界観に合うでしょう）幻想的で、そして登場キャラも前作よりも電波さが減ってもっと現実味を感じられる。音楽も大変素晴らしく、イベントシーンとぴったりしていると思う（なんだかPSP時代のフェ〇ト/エ〇ストラを思い出す）。 ただし、ローディングタイムと画面についてはやや不満です。イベントや会話発生後→自由移動の遷移上、ちょこちょことローディング画面の暗転を挟むことが多い。他のゲームだとこういうのは基本シムレースになっていることが多いため、次回作（根幹はもう変えられないと思うので、EP3での改善を求めない）で改善して欲しいところだ。マップの遷移時が仕方がないにせよ、同じマップでもローディング画面が頻繁に出るとかなり没入感を損ねてしまうと思う。 あとリリィの撫でられるところをもっと増やして、というか増やせ！VRChatアバターのほうが触れるパーツがあるんだぞ！負けるな！","I am the one who played the previous games from dearest, like Tokyo Chronos, Altdeus. Both of them I have been no doubt to give 5 stars. However, this one I only can give 3.5 stars after I completed all episodes. The system in VR of japanese AVG is a new trial. Obviously the ability of this company is not enough to reach the bottom line of explore against foreign company. It is extremely boring in moving, interacting and solving the puzzles. I falled in sleep so many times. For the story, maybe I have a over expectation. My feeling is ""Ok, that is the end finally"". No connection from Altdeus that you need not to play it if you are the fan from Altdeus. It just fulfils the beginners who play japanese gal game first time. One more thing, the graphic is very bad in default resolution neither quest 2 or quest pro. If you want to have a good graphic, you need to use sidequest for changing the resolution. I dunno why some reviews will say the graphic is better than Altdeus. Hence, I give it 1 star to make more balance in the actual rating. Thank you.","I started off thinking this game was just gonna be like a new anime game. And the only reason I bought it is because I watch anime. And I am SO glad that I bought this. It's a sensational experience to people who don't like anime and those who do. The music is amazing, the story is even better and the gameplay is as smooth as you could get. All in all its an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone. Can't wait for episode 2","This game had a well written story with likable characters, except Lily. The scenic background and AD world was just spectacular with all of the visuals. This game had lots of creative interactions with fun challenges which still stayed with the storyline. It was well paced and felt like an actual dream job. The time traveling and memory viewing was quite enjoyable and I especially loved the visuals for that. I really enjoyed the fact that you could do whatever you wish mostly in chapter two although you mostly stayed on the storyline, you could cure patients and do other side conversations and tasks. It didn’t feel constricting and that’s one of the many reasons this game is so amazing. I could go on and on but I really recommend this game!","It's not an interactive story.... It's just a STORY. a very long and slow one. With the occasional tap on the door, helping a red ghost or following arrows- its a guided story experience. I am trying so hard to get pass the idea that I am BORED!!! Not to mention- I am only 30% in and didn't even get to ep 2 yet. SO BORED"
