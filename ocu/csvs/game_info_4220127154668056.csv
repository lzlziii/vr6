Descent Alps - Demo,"In Descent Alps, skiing is controlled by moving the whole body. You shift your body weight and lean into the curve. You hunch down to carve the skies and make quick turns. Descent Alps have been available for one year in various pre-release versions. The game has been downloaded close to 100k times and the slopes have been worn down by pre-release skiers. All feedback and knowledge gathered during the first year of Descent Alps have evolved the game into its first full release. The core remains the same, but the experience has been refined and is now faster, better, bigger, and easier accessible! Note: This is the DEMO version of Descent Alps. The full game is available on App Lab.",3+,,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Music, Simulation, Sports",English,0.2.1,Sutur,Things3D,https://www.sutur.io/,"Jan 19, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4220127154668056/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4220127154668056&r=1, https://www.sutur.io/privacypolicy",429.1 MB,,,,,
