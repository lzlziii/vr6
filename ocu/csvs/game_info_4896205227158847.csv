Gun Blade,"GUN BLADE is our first VR Shooting Game. We want to make a simple, funny and classic shooting game. We think all of you remember when you were child, playing a shooting was the most exciting and funny time. So, in order to bring back that feeling, we decided to make a NORMAL and SIMPLE shooting game but just in VR, as we think that VR is becoming more and more popular. Let's play and give us some suggestions to make GUN BLADE more funny and exciting.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Shooter,English,0.1,KAZEVR TECHNOLOGY LIMITED,KAZEVR TECHNOLOGY LIMITED,https://www.kazegames.com/,"Jun 1, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4896205227158847/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4896205227158847&r=1, https://www.kazegames.com/post/privacy-policy-of-gun-blade",121.5 MB,"This game is very fun, however I think the levels should be a little easier to start. Powerups should be more readily available. Also, there isn't an option (settings) to turn off the music. I like to hear the sounds, but not necessarily the music all the time. Overall this is a great game and I am looking forward to updates."
