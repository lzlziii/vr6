That being said, this is a well made game. The graphics are still 'VR Performant Pastel', but have more heft than most. This is a thick enough experience to be worth releasing, I suppose.","This game is well made, and the mechanics of the game works amazingly. I love the environment of the game. Also, Olly is fun and interactive. I recommend this game to my friends.","I absolutely love this game, there are so many levels and 3 different areas to choose from! It's so much fun and a challenge at times, which I enjoy. Olly is the cutest little friend/partner along side you as you play. You can pick on him by throwing fruits at him which is funny, or wait for him to throw you some golden fruits to score more points with! I highly recommend getting this game for yourself and trying it out! 3..2..1.. LET'S PLAY! ðŸ˜Š",The physics are good and the feeling is fine when you launch the fruit.,"It's a great game to train aiming, it seems easy, but it gets more and more complicated, it would be fun to play with more people at the same time. Totally recommended!"
