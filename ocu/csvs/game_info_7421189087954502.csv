This review is not biased, I'm not a sound designer and moderator, I'm not being held at gun point rn. Play the game, please. Also the game made me bust ong frfr 💸💸💸💸🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️",Master runners is very creative and fun when it comes to how the game is made and it is definitely one of the best gtag fan games I have played! I definitely recommend it to anyone who has not played it yet.,its a pretty decent game has lots of gamemodes with an og map which gives nostalgia and 3 levels of horror which imo are actually good and scary you should give this game a try!!,I lost my og badge and I never deleted the game nor did a factory reset yet when I logged on the new update i had all of my cosmetics. I then went to the discord to ask if I could get it back because I had footage of me buying it and he didn’t help me at all just trying to ignore the conversation,I just shot and killed a child and this game helped me cope
