(LIVE)",ByOwls | Argarium,Argarium LTD,https://rivalrides.com/,"Jan 24, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5406747086009078/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5406747086009078&r=1, https://www.rivalrides.com/zh/privacy",Terms of Service,1.72 GB,I love the cooking mode reminds me of the game where u cook food give to the customer but cheaper i love the zero gravity mode the 8 headed monsters makes it more competition so does the cart ride the grapple make a lot more competitive i like the one where u shoot the wizards monsters (forgot the name) but really fun overall,The reasons I really love this game is because there is so many fun and multiple games. I can play with my friends and others and pretty much every time I get into a full match. I love this game and I would play with others,This game is a very good game if your wanting to play a competitive game online it’s a fun challenge and makes my day when I play it they also do fun game nights every Friday to win cool rival rides merchandise and game cards,This game should be on the official oculus store there's bunch if fun things you can do with freinds and if you miss echo area play this they have a similar ga.emode but with a dragon fun game 5 stars,"Wow let me just say, this game is pure fun! 4 Mini games which include 2 kart riders which test your aim, zero gravity battle with dragons!?, and a cookout!(favorite btw) more details about each is on a YouTube trailer so check it out. The devs and community of this game is insane with how nice everyone is! Devs are active in the community and even on weekly events like game night they tune in a play with us sometimes. You can get cosmetics with earn-able in-game currency, some bugs as expected with every game but I already know the hard working devs are working on them, This Is a party game! So if you aren’t planning to ask anyone to play in like the discord, make sure you invite some buddies personally to play with you(although the game does offer solo mode). Plans for more games and features have been announced! Join the discord to have a chance to be KING OR QUEEN (Current King) And that’s rival rides! Definitely a pickup for sure!"
