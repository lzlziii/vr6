I‚Äôm just another person telling you how much this game slaps, bugs? Of course it has bugs, quite a lot but it‚Äôs overlook-able if you see the meat and potato‚Äôs of the gameplay, also it‚Äôs still in App Lab, if you expected a glitch less game go play something like Fallout 76‚Ä¶ oh wait- anyways‚Ä¶ Actual Facts: This game is a Extraction Shooter, like Escape from Tarkov but in VR, at the time of writing this they only have 2 maps, one called Missile Silo, and the other being called Island of Tabor, you go in, being items, but if you die you lose them, and trust me pal, you will be dying A LOT, you need tactic to survive here, all of your Call of Duty rush-down strategies won‚Äôt work here, the game can be confusing but that‚Äôs okay, it has a lot of depth to it, also with active as HELL dev‚Äôs, and when I say active I mean ACTIVE, they push updates left and right, it may take a week or two but that‚Äôs better patch rates then a lot of other studios, this game also has a amazing community, I highly recommend checking out their discord and website, did I also mention they have a website? Because it slaps as well! I‚Äôve found some great friends on there, they also plan on updating with new maps and items, so prepare yourself, because this game works on a Wipe system, meaning that it will reset periodically starting everyone from the beginning. Quick Tips and Rules to Liveby: Rule 1: Trust nobody random unless you are fine with losing your stuff, this game is hardcore, your die and you lose stuff, trust in this game with randoms is thin, when in a raid, you can try talking to the other players, keyword, TRY, if your out of ammo and outclassed, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with trying to make a quick friend and not end up eating lead, but just be prepared to have a 5 course meal. Hold your left hand to your mouth, and press X to mute, on your watch is a light on the left side, if it‚Äôs green, it‚Äôs a open mic, if its red, nobody will hear you, make sure its red unless you plan on being a social butterfly, because people know how to track you down based on background sound alone. Wash away your stress, you WILL die, you WILL lose gear, you WILL make mistakes, and that is alright, you just need to make a push, I‚Äôve seen major comebacks from impossible odds in this game, if you try and practice you can do some great things. Learn from your mistakes, in this game if you die it‚Äôs a quick jump to a Black screen, with some basic information, every-time you die, ask yourself what you could‚Äôve done differently, maybe you were too aggressive, maybe you forgot to swap out mags, maybe you took the road instead of the trees, die, learn, repeat, learning is your best weapon here, people who know how to approach a firefight are deadlier then the inexperienced. Cons: I wasn‚Äôt able to buy the Founding Fathers DLC /jk Quick Summery: Fun, Glitchy, Stressful, Addictive, I recommend, worth the price tag","‚û°Ô∏è questlinks.bio.link ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Leave a like before you go get the code pls! üôåüèª This game is something special, its Escape From Tarkov in VR. There might be bugs but you can really see how much the devs are working on this with constant updates bringing us new things. Buying games in early access its a great option, every update gives you a reason to come back and enjoy it in a different way Hey where are you going? Leave the üëçüèª!","Ya know how dark chocolate is kinda bitter but if you like it it‚Äôs delicious? This game is like that, there‚Äôs that delicious chocolatey gameplay with cool features and fun mechanics. Then there‚Äôs the bitter part where you might accidentally grab the wrong item or how it takes ages to level up the vendors but I love all of it. It‚Äôs not without its bugs or glitches but neither is dark chocolate. And on top of this the chocolate makers at Combat Waffle Studios are constantly fixing things and improving their game. This is a wonderful game and I think you should give it a shot. Happy chocolate eating!"
