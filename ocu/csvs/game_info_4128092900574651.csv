Also PLEASE MAKE TEXTURES if you can do that this game would be perfect, also customization for your suit would be nice.",It was so realistic üóøü¶çü•µ,"This game has ungodly potential, the swinging physics are amazing, and the layout of the map is good however, these are my only compliments. So i feel there need to be some improvements... -textures. just any kind of building textures, and street textures. -customization. at least let me change the color of my hands, if you want to add onto that, give some different hand textures and designs. although its not very important. -different jumping mechanics. the jumping we have now is buggy and doesnt work half the time. just let me push a button to jump. -make the webs travel faster. its annoying to just watch the webs travel for a couple seconds before hitting anything, if anything at all. speaking of which... -reticles. Just something to help us aim. -turning. something like some turning settings. snap turning is disorienting. -something to do. add some targets to aim at and shoot for points, or even drones to take down. something other than just swinging. Now id like to mention some things it would be cool to see, but its not important. -cars. when and if street textures are added. some cars driving in the streets would be pretty cool. -weather. weather changes, like rain, snow, stuff like that... - different web settings. when and if theres something for us to take down or fight, there should be different web settings that you can change with a button. like a web made to catch things, rapid fire, yknow add some variety. Now im no expert at games. However I know that this game has A LOT of potential and im just suggesting things that would fulfill even a bit of that potential. the game as it is now is... enjoyable. but get boring very quickly. If you have read this far, i appreciated you. have a good day!",I feel like spider man.,I love the game but the last time I played a year ago it did not change at all would love to see better buildings
