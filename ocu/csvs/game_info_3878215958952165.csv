I thought I was the only one who loved them so much before the internet proved me wrong. I had high hopes for this one after the steam release a couple years ago which was fantastic! This gave me the feel of the old NES shadowgate on steroids. I found myself wishing for a crouch button but it wasn't needed to complete anything. All the mechanics worked well but the shield and turrets parts were not my favorite and the only thing that did not feel like Shadowgate. The only other negative (and both are small) was the other games managed to feel ominous and dangerous even without being action games. That aspect was absolutely fantastic. That seems muted here. HOWEVER! I absolutely loved this game and was crushed when it ended. The last section was epic! Never seen anything like that on Quest. Kudos devs. You knocked this one out of the park and I can't wait for book 2!,"I have been playing these mystery puzzle, adventure games on the PC off and on for awhile. Now in VR, I am enjoying them even more. This game is full of surprises and some tough mental challenges as well as some physical ones. What I liked most about it is the wise-cracking raven and the fact that I couldn't complete it in short order. I found that spending some time to get the game and controls to your liking, will save you some heartburn down the line. Be prepared for things that go bump in the dark. It was alot of fun and we are looking forward to the next installment in 2024. The devs were quick to help me resolve a few personal issues within the game. So kudos to you for customer support! With a big thanks for the follow ups!",I really feel like this purchase was a waste of my money. I really thought this game would be great but its really not. The crow doesn't always come when I call it which is annoying when I want to use its eye to check an area out. The visual is very pixilated and jerky which makes me feel sick and dizzy after a bit. I feel like I've been walking around the dungeons doing the same things for too long. It's boring and the sounds get tiresome. There are much better adventure games out there so I've given up on it and bought something better.,"Really enjoying the game, it’s got the right mix of puzzling difficulty (with helpful hints as needed) and creepiness with occasional jump scares to keep you on your toes. The silly spiders are absolutely adorable for those arachnophobes. Such a thoughtful option. I think I’m getting near the end, super confused about the glowing red circle hovering at an angle just above one of he rocks in that big section with the three levels and the wraiths. May have to do some research.","I played shadowgate on Nes a lifetime ago. Im an old school gamer, and when i found out that shadowgate was on vr..well i got excited and purchased it right away. I haven't finished the game.. still playing and taking my time. I love the gameplay so far, and the puzzles are challenging. The crow companion feature is different and makes it unique. So far, game play has been smooth, with no motion sickness but i do use the teleport feature. I find the game gives off a creepy vibe, which i like..not scary but just creepy, like looking over your shoulder or hair stands up on your neck..lol Anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers or puzzle games will enjoy this one. It's worth the money. To save a few $ on this game and more check out link below or msg me bio.linkbgryphon just add / after the word link"
