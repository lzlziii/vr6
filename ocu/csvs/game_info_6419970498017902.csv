Better get checked for ADD). Visuals are top shelf. Hand tracking works but is a little clunky. But the message at the end is worth it. I didn't expect to cry in VR today!,"Finished this today and I’ve got to say that this game was well made. I like the use of the narrating voice at beginning getting more and more negative, as it made me realize during one of the combat sections; “This is our character being negative.” And I also like the fact, despite VR being fairly limited for unarmed combat without FBT, the Self-Defense Moves were still implemented well. (I will admit, though, even after the Hand Tracking Updates to quest, that controllers were better because it tracked better, but Hand-Tracking was fine overall.) Only gripe that I have is that there doesn’t seem to be a mode where I can use all of the Moves with difficulty of my choice. Would definitely play the game again if they allowed this, but it’s whatever.",Brilliant approach of self-defense experience in VR with a beautiful storytelling. Congrats!,"The message and substance of this experience is so thoughtful and meaningful. It is rare to see such an important message delivered in VR and I hope we see more of it. Great use of hand tracking and spatial audio. I found the experience to be easy, intuitive, and inspirational.","UPDATE: I got the hand tracking to work, although functionality was shaky at best. In fact, it was so bad that I stopped playing mid-game. As I was being relentlessly pummeled by the enemy while hopelessly attempting to successfully form the hand gesture to quit the app, the guide kept cheering me on by exclaiming, ""Good job! You're doing great!"" That should tell you all you need to know. I picked up this game(?) Because of the appealing graphics and supposed hand tracking action mechanics. However, I never made it through to any of the actual gameplay. That's how laughably cheesy the narrative is. The guide's voice and the writing are just...bad. Maybe I'll try to see past that and give it another shot. More importantly, though: hand tracking didn't seem to work for me. After selecting hand tracking as the mode of controls, my hands were never detected and I couldn't select anything or proceed to the game at all. It never seemed to detect my hands, or the settings didn't engage. How exactly is the hand tracking supposed to work?"
