Sam and Max: This Time It's Virtual!,"Sam is a dog with a hat. Max is a hyperkinetic naked rabbity thing. Together, they’re the Freelance Police, the intergalactically famous agents of indiscriminately applied justice, now starring in their umpteenth video game, Sam & Max: This Time It’s Virtual! Even multimedia evil-slappers like Sam & Max could use a hand, and this time they’re using the incomprehensible magic of virtual reality to invite the player into their off-kilter world for a furious day of monster-slaying, obstacle courses, responsibly discharged firearms, and, of course, saving the entire freaking world. Key features: •Discover the horrible and socially relevant secrets lurking behind, under, and within Cap’n Aquabear’s rotting theme park! •Push yourself to be the best of the best of the middling, as a dog and a naked rabbity thing harangue and cajole you through a bewildering assortment of Freelance Police Academy training challenges. •Immersion so real you can feel Sam’s breath on your neck!",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Interactive Story","English, Chinese (China), French (Belgium), French (Canada), French (France), Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Venezuela)",1.0.2,HappyGiant,Big Sugar,http://www.happygiant.com/samandmax,"Jul 8, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3044409625637497/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3044409625637497&r=1, https://happygiant.com/terms-of-service",Terms of Service,1.44 GB,"TLDR? I love this game with my whole heart but it’s not perfect. I’d still definitely recommend it. Message me for my code if you want it but you’re not sure about paying full price!! I am a MASSIVE Sam and Max fan to the point it’s one of my autistic special interests, so if you’re more critical you might take this with a grain of salt. I’m very passionate about both this series and video games in general. I ADORE this game. It is genuinely the reason I bought my headset. The ability to stand side by side with these characters is incredible and I enjoyed every second of it. The game is packed full of references to older games if you look around which I always welcome. The mechanics work, if a little clunky, but nothing you don’t get used to after a moment. This isn’t to say this game isn’t without flaws, however. Sometimes I felt that if I got stuck on a puzzle, that was just it. They rarely give you new clues if you’re stuck for a while, and because I am, for lack of a better word, really stupid, I had to break my immersion to go look up a hint. The writing is also charming, but sometimes it doesn’t quite feel like the Sam and Max we know and love. They joke with you quite well, but not always each other, which is strange because their bickering is what makes the series itself a lot of the time. Overall, I do still love this game. These characters are massive comforts of mine and to feel like they’re talking to me is pretty priceless in my eyes. If you’re a game critic, probably not for you. I’m very passionate about this game and would love more people to experience it!","I grew up with these guys and played all the PC games several times. I couldn’t believe they were here in VR. I immediately purchased this game without reading about it. I’m only happy I’ve bought this game for the Sam and Max banter and company. That was worth it for me as I literally grew up with them, and seeing them come to life is totally worth the $30. But this game is terrible. It’s so buggy and so frivolous. I only liked the escape room challenge. Sure enough combining any objects together isn’t necessarily logic based, like a milk carton with a squirt gun. I honestly reached %95 to the end and just quit and deleted it when I realized how much fun I wasn’t having. You want some? You want that? You like that? Even after what I wrote? Ok, change comma to period L I N K T R , E E / D I S C O U N T F U R Y","A valiant effort. But plays like hot garbage. All the mechanics are barely function, when they do function, which is almost never, to the minimum acceptable level. Easily broken with a user experience thay has a lot to be desired. The classic Sam and max humor and dialogue are the only thing to pull me through to the end. If this was a not a Sam and Max game I would have given up on it early on. As a $30 tech demo / proof of concept and not a fully functional game I cannot recommend it. I'm sure the developers did the best they could. Because a passion for the characters was evident, with a lot of incomplete good ideas, I can only assume that they were rushed to release it quicker than was reasonable.",The best storyline in this police game and it brings back memories!,"I'm a new father with fond memories of Sam n Max games. It is super frustrating to spare an hour to play in an evening, only to spend half of it in the same spot because of a broken experience. E.g. after finishing all 9 trials, the graduation did not trigger (until I played the 9th trial again). In aquabear disco, I cannot get the foam to work, despite having spent 45 minutes now with 2 walkthroughs and doing everything needed for it. Don't make a game if you cannot polish it enough."
