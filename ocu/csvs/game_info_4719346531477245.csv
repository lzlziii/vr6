I asked him if it has any issues or bugs that he dislikes about it and his words were. "" No, it's like a perfect shooting game. I love it"" he is currently on the demo but it's in the living room jumping and spinning around while yelling like he is a Spartan ""360 no scope HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA......"" I'll be buying full version as soon as I have 15 bucks to spare!","This seemed like great funâ€¦I love an arcade style shooting game. However the snap turning is more like a slower smooth turn and gives me motion sickness. It needs to be more of a â€˜snap.â€™ The only other option was smooth turning itself and that is worse for motion sickness. If the snap turning was different, Iâ€™d definitely buy this. Thanks.",Game is fun love it so much that I what to buy the real game user name is Brandon and code is 2053,Ever since I play it was a good game and one day I will get the full game.Have a good dayðŸ˜ƒ and my username is Jordan and my code is 9807
