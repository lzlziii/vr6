Shame the interface is so poor and unpolished. In response to your request to expand on the problems I had. Twice during my hour or so use I become unable to move. I could look around but not move and had to exit the app and restart. The app crashed once when trying to move around. I once found myself out of bounds a few times. I tried to get to the 360' globe to the far right of the starting position, but every time I tried to reach it or use it I would end up taking the kayak ride. Something I did not like that was not interface related was when using the flying drone. The reflections on the glass spoiled it as they were not natural looking and intrusive. The rock climbing is far less than perfect I do not want to end on a negative note, to be fair the app is free and I really do think if you sort out the interface and do more testing so that it feels polished, you will have something really good. Right now it feels like you have put an awful lot of effort into making it, but very little effort on testing and polishing it."
