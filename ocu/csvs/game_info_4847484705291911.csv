Though I wish the graphics were more realistic like other games with nature. I like exploring the different places. The maps are big to explore. One has hidden caves that one leads to a swamp. You find one by climbing up a big hill when exploring. I don't like the ufo in one of the quests. It stalks me, follows me and upsets my peace. Going into night can be annoying and there should be a way to turn it off. If you get sick of the music I found if you go to settings on your watch just above inventory you can turn the repetitive music down to zero and just have nature sounds. The inventory is weird. I don't know why anyone would want to collect those weird statues and stuff. Trying to put furniture in place is frustrating and tricky. They spin around too fast as it's hard to control. I just like exploring around. I have fibromyalgia and the floating sensation distracts me from my body. I can ""hike"" in the woods and other landscapes that are difficult for me to do in real life. Though, even if it isn't as realistic it still is nice. Why don't the campfires light up at night? Like, what's the point then. Also the fireplaces don't have wood in them and also don't light up. Please make that possible. Nighttime is actually pretty bright. It would be nice to collect our fruits and vegetables and put in baskets or bowls. Don't know if that's possible. I will see if it is. Im not understanding why I can only build my homestead in the flat scenes that don't have hills or paths. Is it possible to have two homesteads without deleting the other? I'd like to have two.",I absolutely love this game! It's very relaxing to me after a long stressful day! I'm addicted. Need more traveling places. Also would love to have larger selections of things to buy to build up my lands and homes.,"The starting quest was glitchy. It would spin my character in circles and float me up in the air, causing motion sickness. Not a great start to a game. I gave it more of a chance. Placing items in your inventory was also a challenge. It kept dropping them to the ground. The areas you explore donâ€™t have much to them, either. Not very impressed :/","I played the free trial, and liked the game enough to purchase it. I played it a bit more, bit I really feel that the UI is awfully clunky. Like, all those buttons you have to push and you have to look at your wrist and all that, and the inventory is cumbersome. I'd like to see the devs look at an app with a real good UI, like Population One. You could make the UI more like theirs. It's not patented or anything.","I enjoy this game a lot in small chunks. It has a lot of potential but just barely misses the mark to greatness. If you will hear me out Devs? If possible increase fps while walking in locomotion. I use teleport to reduce eye strain and headaches. Love the concept. It gives me the cozy game feel like story of seasons and animal crossing vibe with a adult spin. Would like to have more VR interactions instead of point and click. My biggest ask is expand on farming. I want to tend to them beautiful animals you created. Milk the cows, shave the sheep, collect the chickens eggs and so on. I think this game is well worth the price if you enjoy grinding life sim style games with exploration. It is fun and can keep you entertained for hours at a time but will leave you wanting just a bit more. Please keep working on this Devs. Your so close to something truly special."
