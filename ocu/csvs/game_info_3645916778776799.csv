It's not just a fitness app - it's an escape from the daily grind, where you can forget you're exercising and have fun instead. And, comparing it to other major fitness apps, it's at the high end for calorie burn, plus you WILL spend more time in cardio and peak heart rate zones than many of its major competitors. I'm a huge fitness fanatic, and I mean HUGE...and I LOVE this app!","I really like the Game and timing ist great most of the time, but i feel like some songs are really off constantly, for example the last 2 songs from the 30 minute exercise in session 2. This is especially bad because i really like the other songs here. I also haven’t found an option to choose single tracks individually if there even is one. Overall, I would totally recommend the game.",A great app. The beat of the music works very well with the game. Love the exercise. Enjoyed the demo version and love the full game even more. Thank you,"I've been on Hitstream for nearly a year. It's enabled me to regain fitness that I've not had for years. To the point that several people have said I look super fit! It's stretching enough to get my heart to its maximum. Workouts go through aerobic to anaerobic. I use it on average 5 times a week, yes addicted! The songs/tunes are nicely varied across most styles and feature some amazing artists. The choreography is very well put together and gives a wide variety of movements. Love it!",Previously gave this 5 stars and am now reducing the amount to 4. Game is good but now needs updates such as songs. Squatting setting doesn’t seem correct as it doesn’t drop low enough even with half squats off. Also need ability to change colors of the targets.
