It doesnt really, I think it uses google maps to generate some transition videos, but the content is from elsewhere. It's good 360 videos and I think some were 3d too. It was all very earnest and comfortable.",I'm sure it's great but for some reason I only get the sound but no picture. Downloaded and installed twice. Tell me what I'm doing wrong. Cheers.,I am using the occulus quest 2. Last update as usual. All I saw was a white screen when using stationary guardian,Just a white screen after clicking on locations and audio playing only.,"Great app! I travelled to beautiful places across all continents and saw amazing stuff. I felt like having an English tour guide always by my side and got 100% the feeling of being there. The most immersive parts of the tour, when you get close to wild animals and when you take a dive into the water as a scuba diver are the best!!! I'd like to see more places and have more immersive experiences soon ;)"
