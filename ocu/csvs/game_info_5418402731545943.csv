Two really cool things about it are the feeling of flying and the music. Otherwise, the game is pretty monotonous and boring, boss battles are tiring, and the locations are almost the same. It's a really big world here, but it's practically empty. All you'll find in it are a few boring enemies and statuettes. Plus the pseudo-cartoon graphics that have filled their teeth.","Such a good game, love the mechanics and fighting, the grappling could do with a tiny bit more range but otherwise I've never had so much fun on a headset and would highly recommend. Looking to 100% the game now!","The amount of content it offers & the multiplayer was fantastic, a great VR title that deserves more attention, especially since the quest store lacks in the multiplayer aspect I'm glad this game exists","This game is fantastic. ï¿¼ I love how the swinging feels. Itâ€™s easy to learn, but a little harder to master. ï¿¼ have you ever wanted to feel like Spider-Man then you need to get this game. I only have two complaints. Most of the time I have to try ï¿¼ï¿¼multiple times to activate the bow. And the level, I think it was after the first Bossfight, was super frustrating for me. You had to collect multiple items and the location of the items is only indicated by some glow that is most of the time hard to spotï¿¼. And when I respawned, I completely lost orientation. Everything looked the same. ï¿¼ it would have been nice to have a compass where to find the next item. ï¿¼Thatâ€™s why it took me a long time to get back into the game, but when I did and finished that stage, it was a complete blast again. ï¿¼ The levels are huge and the feeling, when you pull off multiple swings in a row, is absolutely amazing!","ðŸš¨FULL REVIEW VIDEO IS AVAILABLE BY SEARCHING â€˜GAMERTAG VR WINDLANDS 2â€™ ON YOUTUBEðŸ¤Œ Back in 2017 I had my first experience of PCVR and the first game I ever played was Windlands 2. I had of course played the first game on PSVR but that was purely swinging and collecting items, which was fine by the way but Windlands 2 had combat and multiplayer. The combination of how smooth and natural the movement feels along with the truly massive multiplayer boss fights just left me wanting more. I experienced a sensation that only virtual reality can deliver. Catapulting myself up in the air to get as much as height as possible then pulling back the string on my energy bow and letting loose some devastating shots to these machine was at the time an experience like no other."
