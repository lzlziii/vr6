Tower Tag,"Tower Tag is a hyper-dynamic futuristic paintball like PVP shooter with a grappling hook locomotion method that becomes second nature instantly. Without any motion sickness! Conquer as many tower platforms with your team as possible to be able to move quickly across the field and beat your opponents with tactics and surprise. Tower Tag works without complicated button assignments so you can concentrate on the essentials, become one with the game and let your body be the controller. Play casual matches with and against your friends or join the Tower Tag Community with your team to climb the rankings (coming soon) and win tournaments. To be successful training is important, but physical fitness and strategy are also essential.",7+,Multiplayer,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Action, Arcade, Shooter",English,0.2.8_QuestPort_238,VR Nerds Studios,VR Nerds Studios,https://vrnerds.biz/,"Aug 2, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3812563858803226/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3812563858803226&r=1, https://www.vrnerds.de/tower-tag-quest-privacy/",634.5 MB,"This game is just pure fun. Catching and jumping between the towers, team up, kill the opponents, multiple challenging arenas, what more can one wish from a game?","these guys know their title stinks so they reach out to be dishonest which to their TOTAL MISUNDERSTANDING ultimately will land them more trouble because being dishonest brings in .more things that resonates with dishonesty. If you're too dumb too figure out what I am leading too, (continued) I'm sure you'll easily find the reviewer that said that statement concerning this app being their favorite, or find another review stating how spectacular it is .... Lots to choose from. , there is absolutely no possible way This is their favorite game there's no way This game makes zero sense and there is nobody on it it's a dead game I'm surprised I'm even giving it three stars The Federal Trade Commission announced today it is exploring a potential rule to combat deceptive or unfair review and endorsement practices, such as using fake reviews, suppressing negative reviews, and paying for positive reviews. Deceptive and manipulated reviews and endorsements cheat consumers looking for real feedback on a product or service and undercut honest businesses","Tower Tag is athletic, competitive, strategic, and out and out fun! The community is one of the best I have ever encountered, and I have made so many friends through it. It also consistently gets my heart rate up and I look forward to playing so much that I can't wait for the next session or am super disappointed when I can't play. Obsessed? Who, me?! ABSOLUTELY! üòÅ",just plqyed my first game online wnd it was crazy fun. only one person online but i have just joined a discord so thwt may give me fun. i am sure you guys will make improvements in the future but for now i think its the best VRvgame so far,I was having a blast just playing with bots. AI is good enough to have fun. But playing with real people would obviously be better. More people need to try this. Highly recommend!
