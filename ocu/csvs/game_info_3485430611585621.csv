I was having trouble with loading songs onto it for a while, but was able to get in touch with the dev and he helped me sort out my file issues quickly. great visualizer and definitely worth it.","High quality formats are not supported (FLACs and M4A AAC or ALAC). So, I'd bear with MP3 320kbs or lossless WAVs right? Wrong! They sound awful in this app! It seems to playback at 16bits or something, not Hi-res. It doesn't play back your music at their native stream rate. My UPNP server stream also didn't work as well. The Quest natively supports LDAC which is 24bit/96khz audio stream via a compatible bluetooth DAC, so there is no excuse for this glorified music player to play music this bad. It's a shame, I feel as if this has so much potential, but this just feels like a quick cash grab. But I'll give the developer credit for the cool VFX though.",pf - dark side of the moon + visualiser I expect immersive concerts to become more of a thing. In the meantime this visualizer is worth getting.,I can’t get it to import my music. I tried 4 songs and it just says it’s verifying Will only play what is in the list or it’s channels Maybe I’m not understanding the instructions or I’m missing something,"This is an AMAZING app. The visualizations are incredible in VR. There is an excellent variety of them and some are seriously mesmerizing. I had my mouth open. I kid you not, one of the best visual apps I've seen and the visuals are in tune with the music. There is a great selection of music and mixes that is integrated into the ""hear this"" area of the app so you have many awesome music options in all different genres. I cannot recommend this app enough. There are literally dozens of visualizations to keep things fresh and many of them are just WOW. This needs to come out on the actual store and be supported by more people as it is FANTASTIC. A hidden gem I have stumbled upon."
