Even after uninstalling and reinstalling it still said it was pirated. I tried uninstalling them restarting my oculus and reinstalling but it said the same thing.,I'm only on the demo but If the rest of the game is better I think it's a must have !!,Just not very good,"I've always loved the 19XX games, and this knocks it out of the park. The different play perspectives are super-cool! And even though I get nauseous playing almost everything on the Quest, this was very comfortable! I played the DEMO but may pull the trigger on the full game."
