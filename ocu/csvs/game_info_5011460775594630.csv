I'm not saying it's bad I'm just asking why,"I like the demo, but this demo is extremely glitchy, and annoying to work with. When I grabbed a wood piece, then cut it while I’m holding it, it would start a wood chip tornado, which would start cutting other trees, and gathering more wood chips. Then it would start making this ear grading noise, and lagging like hell. It was fun while I had it, but it’s pretty bad and glitchy.",Hi.Your game is very fun but… when will the real game come out and would it be free or would it cost money. Cheers.Gavross14,Good idea needs improvement. After the initial learning time I found farming quite fun. For someone new to vr its a little clunky. I look forward the the inventory pouch selecting every time I want it. Same with settings. Also the setting not disappearing through the floor. Peices of wood getting stuck to my hands. I managed to fix the big pieces by dragging them off me but a small peice forever follows me around. The axe would be great if i could use two hands or maybe make it smaller. The water bucket needs to be tilted to one side to get the water easily. When I set it down I just ended spilling water on the floor. I'm not one to be beaten so ill change the way I play to get it working. But this might put some people off. Keep trying people if you don't like it now come back im sure it will improve.,"From what I’ve played of this game so far I’ve loved it, the axe mechanics when chopping the trees is great that’s my favorite part, but as a lot of games on app lab there are some things that could be fixed. For one I haven’t been able to fish well because the line likes to have a seizure in the water. I think the water should have physics of its own so the line of the fishing rod doesn’t spaz out like it does in the air. Other than that though and the occasional rabbit stealing my hand when I try to grab it it’s a great game and I look forward to future updates and versions"
