If you end up using my link thanks a lot! üëçüèª This game is actually pretty cool. I was very surprised by the amount of negative reviews on this game. This game makes me feel like a true ninja and as a person that played fruit ninja back when I was younger, it makes me feel ultra nostalgic. This game is very simple and super satisfying and I often like to come back to it. If this was helpful please press the like üëçüèª button I would really appreciate that :3","Use the link below to get money off this game. Just remove the words ""REMOVE"" and put it all together https://wwwREMOVE oculusREMOVE comREMOVE apprefREMOVE errals/ChaddJ/2215140REMOVE 511885250/?utm_source=2 This game is pretty simple. There are a few different game modes. You can unlock different swords which is kind of cool, but other than that it's the basic fruit ninja game that everyone knows. I got this game knowing it wasn't anything bigger than this. So with that in mind it's great! I mostly got it for younger kids to play. It's great for younger kids because it's simple to understand and do. No buttons required to push, just move your arms. I think it is fun myself to try to beat my high score. It's an easy one to pick up here and there and play for a bit. Kids have really enjoy it! I would recommend this to anyone for a fun, simple game that anyone can do to get a VR experience.","t,ly/QLP4k (Change the comma to a dot. Then paste it into your browser for 25 PERCENT off!)üòÉ ‚ÄúFruit Ninja VR‚Äù is a popular virtual reality game that takes the classic mobile game to a new level of immersion. It allows players to slice and dice flying fruits using motion controllers, making it a satisfying and engaging experience. The game‚Äôs mechanics are simple yet enjoyable, and the VR environment adds a level of excitement and challenge. However, the gameplay might feel repetitive after a while, and the content can be somewhat limited. Overall, if you enjoy casual and interactive VR experiences, ‚ÄúFruit Ninja VR‚Äù could be a fun choice for you.üòÉ","This game would be 4 stars if sold for $7, given the amount of content. It contains only one scene, 3 very basic gameplay modes, no daily, weekly, or monthly scoreboards (just one big one with infinite scores at the top). The blades have no weight or real inertia to them, but they still overswing in a non-physics way, which can drive you nuts until you realize this is why you keep hitting bombs. As such, smooth, medium speed movement and alternate angles are rewarded. Additionally, if you slash, fruit that your sword ahould not intersect still get cut, like your blade is like 8"" wide somehow. Makes it more casual I guess. That being said, if you want to slash fruit, it is a somewhat satisfying 4-star game that kids and maybe new vr players would enjoy. Just man, lower the price, because wtf.","Doesn't feel good at all, so its like the app where you can spam all your fingers and hit everything"
