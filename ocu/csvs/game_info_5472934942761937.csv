COMPOUND,"COMPOUND is a randomized, rogue-lite, free-roaming shooter for Virtual Reality veterans. Duck and dodge around enemy fire in a tough-as-nails retro FPS with multiple locomotion options.

Lots of character. Looks and feels SO GREAT in the game. A lot of weapons to unlock which is fun. I like the different ammo types. Enemy variety is good enough and they all feel pretty unique. Mutations are enjoyable. Once you start getting a hang of the reloading and aiming you start to feel pretty dang cool.,"Great game and many achievements to collect.The retro graphics are awesome and look amazing and the plays extremely well and didn't notice any glitches. All the various weapons and the reloading is really great,so much fun. Great different levels and difficulty settings make it a blast. If your interested,here is some further reduction of 25 percent but it's worth it,even at normal price. Just add the beginning part. /Greekspartan121/5472934942761937/?utm_source=2 Enjoy the game......","Spotted this on Steam a while back and heard rumours of it coming over to Quest but now itâ€™s finally hereâ€¦ This is the 90s kids wet dream! The music and art style, challenging gameplay combined with the randomised rogue-lite aspect makes it feel above and beyond many of the other shooters Iâ€™ve tried thus far. Buy it and thank me later!","Stay tuned after my review to find out how to save on this game, it's a must-experience! Do you enjoy DOOM? Did you grow up with Wolfenstein? Or heck, do you remember that Windows 95 maze Screensaver? ðŸ¤” Okay, maybe not most of you, but this game... How do I explain it...? You spawn into a hotel room, and you have 3 meals to eat. The one you eat determines your difficulty. You have a shooting range to try out all the cool guns, and their even cooler reloads. There's a vending machine, where you can select mods, that you must inject directly into your arm, and changes the whole gameplay! It's wild! This game is a roguelike, and saying that, every playthrough is unique. As you clear a level out of enemies, you take an elevator to the next ""level"" of the evil corporation you're trying to bring down. Get it? Elevator, level...? Anyway, lots of easter eggs Ive yet to find, but it keeps surprising me! The sound design is straight out of the 90's, the puns are ridiculous, and the environments are interactive. Again, it's hard to understand how a VR game plays from a trailer, you just NEED to check this game out! Lemme' help you do that today! Save some cash on this game and more at: beacons DOT ai SLASH justinio (Just remove the CAPITAL WORDS, and scroll to the bottom!) Have an awesome day guys!","At first, the reloading and controls seem awkward, and you might die a lot when caught empty and overwhelmed by enemies. But each run, you get a little better, and when it finally clicks, holy **** is this a fun game. Would love to see some more modes or a campaign. It's better than I expected. Much better."
