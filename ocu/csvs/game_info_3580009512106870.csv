Gambit!,"Alright, we can do this in two ways. We can tell you about a story rich 4-player co-op campaign, the Municipal Mayhem‚Ñ¢, dozens of guns, a myriad of attachments, skins, masks, deathmatch, tournament ladders, minigames, leaderboards, climbing, graffiti, hidden rewards, the GNOP, bossfights, free updates, dedicated customer support, and so on. Or, we can tell you what it‚Äôs really about: Jaguar blood, gunpowder pheromone, treasure chest musk, gun oil bite, winning lottery ticket crumple, last bullet adrenaline, high fives, f*** yeahs, burning rubber, superhero-landing on dust. The world‚Äôs about to end, and you can give it a final push. Rob a train, screw up, go on a grand adventure full of grit and juice, blow up the streets, earn a bounty on your head, and keep the engine running. Join Frank, Cody, Udo, and Kevin, four misfits out to get rich or kill anyone else trying.

Anyway the refund was refused because I must of exceeded the two hours trying different things. Anyway I take it all back after giving it another go and was pleased I did not get the refund and apologise to the developers after deleting my previous review as I think it's really a feature rich enjoyable FPS .,"A really great game. Wish it a had a bigger player base. A lot of people say bad things about this game, but let me tell you here first, this game is awesome, and even better with friends. Don't sleep on this game if your thinking about it just do it. Developers you should also add a zombie survival to this if possible like your doing for zero caliber, would be highly appreciated.","‚Ä¶for $20, this game is economically priced. With the caveat that some extremely annoying choices were made in the final product ‚Äî the screeching ‚ÄúYoooouuuuuuuuuuu!‚Äù SFX that starts every single level (whyyyyy???); the often cringe attempts at edgy humor ‚Äî the overall gameplay is entertaining, fast-paced and graphically smooth. The guns are fun to shoot. And I nearly beat the game before I realized you could purchase more than just the pistols you start with. (I enjoy pogo-ing around enemies with the shotgun in VR.) The solo campaign is on the shorter side (more coming soon, or so they say) and in that regard a little disappointing. But hey, at least it‚Äôs not another roguelike! Considering I spend nearly $20 on a movie ticket these days, I would say Gambit provides a similar return on investment. IDK. Worth $20, especially if you catch it on sale. 3.5 out of 5 (Could be a 4.5 with a few more campaign levels and 30% less edgelord.)","At first I loved the game story was good, guns were super cool and fun to shoot, (I‚Äôm a guy who loves to manually reload guns and I was surprised after I got the first shotgun and was very happy that u could manually reload) but after I started playing the campaign more with a friend I started to find certain bugs that‚Äôs required us to leave and join back, and when I bought the game and played for quite awhile I noticed it said there was three chapters after I finished the first chapter, chapter 2 did not unlock I wish I would‚Äôve known it wasn‚Äôt a full game before I bought the game, and issues with the keycard doors and keycard made me very upset I found the first keycard due to a single video that showed where and how to get it still haven‚Äôt found the other two I did my first play through and I was liking the game till the very end. the game is honestly not horrible but u can‚Äôt play the game without said keycards there is about 15 to 20 doors that require keycard I‚Äôve only found the blue one. i somewhat enjoyed the game wish I would‚Äôve known it wasn‚Äôt full before I spent 16 dollars on it I luckily got it on sale but I was very upset when I learned I couldn‚Äôt play the other 75% of the gameüò≠","I don't understand these 1-2 star ratings. The first time you guys get a VR title that even remotely resembels a console title, you crap on it because you don't know what to make of it? Graphics are phenomenal, gun mechanics and rendering are superb. It has a story, a purpose, and for once not just an ""experience."" Crude adult humor (yeah it has a filter you can turn on/off) but it was made for adults. Adult fun. Period. I use a gun stock in every other shooter I play competitively. ""But I can't use my gunstock here yet."" SO WHAT! Go back to skilled freehanding it ya pleebs. I love this game. Is it done yet? No. Is there more coming? Yes. And I look forward to seeing what else this awesome title has to offer. 5 stars. I'd give it 6 if I could. Even in its current form."
