Wolf and Pigs Demo,"Full Wolf and Pigs game : https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5601617199878444/ Once upon a time, the notorious Pig Brothers gang invaded the New World, blasting and disfiguring nature to build their secret base. Portrayed as evil by the media – who have been bought and paid by the Pig Brothers – the Wolf is the last defense between Nature and the brothers’ greed. With no one to stop them, the Pig Brothers are laying waste to everything in their path, raking in the cash. Everyone thinks that Wolf is dead, but there’s a sliver of hope. It turns out that Wolf has upgraded his body with high-end prosthetic arms loaded with all sorts of weaponry, including shotguns and bombs! Nature has its defender at last.

I would definitely recommend to try it! Art style is very pretty to look at and I enjoyed spin on old folk tale. It's fun to just play around with mechanics, so I would really enjoy arena survival mod, or something similar, where I can just have fun and not worry about missing on story or puzzles. Insight from fellow developer: It can get a bit difficult to visually orient myself in space, since all colors are so bright, so maybe increasing outline or contrast for fake shadows could help with better visual clarity. It will also help to have easier way inside headset how to access full version. Ideally with just one click. Right now, I would have to go to my PC or search on store."
