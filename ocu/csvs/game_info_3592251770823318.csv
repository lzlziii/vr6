Me and one of my friends use this so much I can't wait to get the full version Edit if you could add multiple people sessions so friends can practice together that would be great And I wish it wouldn't spawn the drum sets in my head,Super,It’s fun. I’ve been playing the drums for few years and I’ve gotten pretty good. I then found this app and it was to fun to play. Finding the app was kinda hard because I searched “drum” on the store and didn’t get any results. I then googled vr drumming game and found it. But anyways it’s a nice way to learn and practice drums if you’re away from your kit or you don’t have one. I showed the game to a friend of mine who plays quads and is sort of interested in learning the kit. He is unable to find the demo app on the store for some reason so he hasn’t gotten it on his quest 2 yet (I have the quest 1). Some complaints I have are that the default hi hat sounds weird when open. It just sounds like a closed hi hat but a bit louder but when you play a song and use the open hi hat it sounds good and like a real hi hat so I always end up just starting a song to get the kit and then exiting it. Another thing is that sometimes due to no rebound when you hit the drums your stick will go through and hit another tom. Like if I’m hitting my high tom sometimes my stick goes through and hits my snare. An easy fix to this would just be to make a mode you can toggle on and off in settings where if it’s on once you hit a drum you can’t hit another until you lift your stick back up so you don’t hit through a drum and end up hitting another one. Also the cowbells hitbox is to small and they should add another floor tom.,Paradiddle is a good game and learn how to play drums. I've made about 5 good heats on this game and also I can't get a real drum set in real life. The only thing I wish was more drums to play and also play with marching drums like tyner drums and marching bands drums. What also I think should be fix is the high hat. The high hat vs the one you get when playing songs sounds different and I wish that the high hat that you get sounds like the one you play with during songs. Paradiddle is a great game but I wish there were some fixes and extras.
