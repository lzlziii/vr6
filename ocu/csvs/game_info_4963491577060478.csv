Takes a moment to get down but if you follow the instruction video it's quick and easy to set up. Just tried it for the first time and had to immediately send the link to three more people. Can't wait for more games that take advantage of this feature,"I've been getting my dad into VR, and he enjoyed this one. Works in very small places up to walkable larger rooms. Doesn't get too crazy, so neither of us experienced motion sickness either. Still can't pass Level 17 here!",This is a great shooting game one of the best in VR. Highly recommended.,"Game art cute. Rendered world cute and I just love the technology and immersion. Felt “big” and “organic”. I loved that outlining the furniture later “manifested” as solid barriers in the game. Actually, I’ve wished I could align solid pieces with virtual ones before so I can lean into them now and then for rest or another form or “realism” between virtual and reality (touch feedback). (Not that a rock and a couch cushion feel the same. But closer than a “virtual solid item” and air!). Because it’s October, I found the theme perfect and had a nice time playing around. Extra themes and surroundings over time would allow a game like this really hold a players attention over long periods of time (ie coming back for more gameplay). Perhaps once the game was polished it could release various DLC. A few bucks for different environments. (City. Country. Pirates. Squirrels. Well. Don’t want to personally shoot squirrels but perhaps toss them acorns, lol). — - - Oh. One - if not glitch, but technical (?) - problem for me... Controller pressing oculus flat button. For me “recenters” my play and is useful especially when starting something like Beat Saber or a Bowling game to visually align the game in front if me. Running around games don’t matter as much since the joystick can turn me whatever way and if I need my room bearings after a bit, I do the quick mask tap peek around the room and head back in to my game. However, after walking around a bit, I hit the oculus reentering button in this game. And there went those well placed boundaries. Ie. To clarify, the boundaries were still there but no longer aligned with my real world furniture. I ended up way outside the virtual boundaries within the game actually which disallowed any further physical walking in the game (lest I crash into something within moments) and so I exited out sooner than I would have otherwise.","Have to say normally stuff like this is a lot of faff, this was simple to set up and Alot of fun. Only thing I'd say is maybe add a few more environments and a bit of music for atmosphere. Bought it on sale, totally worth it, very cathartic"
