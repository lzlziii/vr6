Space Pirate Trainer DX,"Space Pirate Trainer DX is the official trainer for wannabe space pirates. Space Pirate Trainer puts you inside one of those awesome classic 80s arcade cabinets, where you’ll fight off relentless waves of droids with all the weapons and gadgets a Space Pirate would ever need. Pick up your blasters, tie up your sneakers and dance your way into the Space Pirate Trainer hall of fame! The all-new DX version will put your skills to the test with kick-ass multiplayer modes. ARENA is a glimpse at the future of VR. Transform any indoor space into an incredible VR arena as you play a manic game of hide and seek with blasters. You’ll need to find a large open space, so start scouting for empty halls, tennis courts, and basketball courts! VERSUS is an all-new multiplayer version of Space Pirate Trainer. Every time you shoot a droid, another one will appear targeting your opponent, ending in all-out blaster chaos!

I enjoy the immersive outer space environment and always learning new things about how to use the weapons. It’s so satisfying to pull in the bots with the laser weapon and hack them in half and it’s feels great to successfully dodge the robot blasts.,"This is still one of my favourite shooters on the quest. A VR classic and a must have (especially for VR beginners). Worth full price.
