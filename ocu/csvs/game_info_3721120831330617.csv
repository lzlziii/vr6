Sometimes, I would not hear my friends even I stood right next to them. I needed to close the app, and restart. Sometimes, I even needed to reboot the headset if we initially joined from party, and switched from party voice to app voice. One occasion, I couldn't watch or hear the music from the screen but my friend was able to. Updated: I am suspecting may be I recently switched Air Link on. I turned it off completely and will see if my issue resolve, and will update again.",Videos with the lyrics don't work in studio or party mode. This app has the potential to be amazing and there's no other kareoke apps I've seen on vr. Please get the android app going and make it so the player can import YouTube tracks.,it freezes after choosing an avatar,Very fun but strange that the singer cannot hear his/her own voice
