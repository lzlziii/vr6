Don't spend a ton of money on lego, GET THIS GAME! Its cheap, good and fun! this is one of the only games I havent bought and refunded before the 2 hours, it was just that good!","Honestly a wonderful game, instead of going out and spending a lot of money on like Lego sets I can instead spend 300 dollars on a headset to do it at home‚Ä¶ but anyway this game is worth the money and it isn‚Äôt much anyway 10/10 game üëç","I won a giveaway from NotTaughtfunny and I had so much fun with it. If you have an oculus but no money for real legos, this is your best option for playing with legos. Although I have some suggestions, maybe add a hand/arm brick for little figs to hold things? Maybe add little swords or small guns for them to hold",One of the best games to play if you are a lego fan. You can get the game for free if you win their weekly giveaways on tiktok! I'd say if you dont win buy the game because it's that good!,I‚Äôve been playing this game when it first came out and I made a few creations my self when the new update came out about the unlimited boundaries I had to play I opened up the game chose city and it just showed black and I waited for a good 10-13 minutes and then it kicked me out that was a few months ago I tried again today but it didn‚Äôt work still but I really love the game keep up the good work
