Also I think they should add pigs that run around and you can shoot just like the chickens,Some things I think you should add are arms instead of the oculus controllers maybe also some zombie full body targets that could kill you anyway that's all from me great game excited for updates in the future,Me and my friend like shooters where we can have small battles for Pavlov shack vr is our favourite one so far we are looking for more WE WANT ONLINE,Much better than it originally was. Still a few kinks but I believe it will work out to be good. I recorded some gameplay of it and I'm posting it on my YouTube channel https://youtube.com/channel/UClbQ25XPq0wZoe_PUvU1hzA tomorrow or May 17. I look forward to some more updates to this game.
