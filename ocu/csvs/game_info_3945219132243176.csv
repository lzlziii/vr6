It didn't really work with hand tracking but by holding the controllers as well as the resistance bands it worked well. I wish it was possible to make the vehicle in the game moved faster! It has a f zero vibe but doesn't feel as fast. Also I wish it was possible to set the starting difficult of the level. If I'm already warmed up then the easier sections at the start make your workout inefficient.,"Andromeda Sports is certainly an interesting game. However, it seems to have a tracking problem with the right hand. None of my right-hand hits registered in a challenge round, even though the tutorial had no problem with doing so. Regardless, this is a really innovative and interesting way of playing and using VR.","If you've played sprint vector before, this is the game that gives that same kind of feeling! This game has good skill expression complexity that gives you that urge to keep trying and keep getting higher scores after every run. I can see this game been extremely fun once the graphic gets more polishing (which honestly is the less stressful part of game development) The core game play is solid!",The game loop is fun and it gets you doing the enough exercise that you find yourself sweating after a while. Absolutely would recommend if you like speed games!!,"Amazing game, I will soo try with an elastic band and write more, but generally it's really nice to exercise as all your body needs to move. Feels a bit like drifting."
