Full open world with all of your favorite fruit ninja games and more! My favourite is the game that shoots fruit at you- can't get enough of this one! Worth full price. Or get it 25prcnt cheaper (the comma is a dot, case matters, and remove spaces): b i t , l y / F N i n j a 2","I find this game pleasant to play but for me it seems to me that the content is very short and that it could still be improved, I count on the developers to add more content to it, especially considering the price paid to acquire it. I have a few suggestions for this: 1- I would like the developers to think about adding special effects to the weapons purchased because there is no point in earning points to buy a weapon that is only aesthetic. (ARC that destroys several fruits once charged, ice saber that slows down timeâ€¦) 2- add the special effects of the arcade mode to the level of the classic mode to make it more playable 3- create a mode for the counter-attack of the fruits because I really liked the concept but I find that only one bomb to lose its blades is excessive at the limit it is necessary to propose a series of 05 blades that it you have to catch in the middle of the game when you lose the one you used 4- increase the time of the archery challenges because a few seconds is very little to be able to appreciate a challenge Hoping that my suggestions will be taken into account by the developers to make this game one of the most exciting.

Was this helpful?ðŸ‘‡","Loved the first game, this is even better. The original was pretty barebones so it's nice to see the new additions. Bows are great. Right now it feels a little bit like fruit ninja 1.75, but you hopefully have some good updates on your roadmap. Still gave you a 5 star because it is great fun.","Overall, the 2nd is better than the first. The bow mode is so fun, and the rhythm mode is cool and challenging, and it's so fun! The classic,zen, and arcade environment makes it more peaceful and fun! Especially with the new master blade,sai, and bow and with the new and cooler weapons, my overall rating is a 10/10, so overall, you should buy it. I hope that helps!"
