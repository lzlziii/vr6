I love escape room type games, and this one is different with the realistic type of mysteries to solve and nerve-racking environments! It's very challenging and satisfying when you get it right! I've only just got into the second case, and I can't wait to go back in! Super deal for the money!",This game is really fun. One of the best games I have played. The story is really engaging the puzzles are difficult which really makes it fun and gives the player a challenge. It is also a bit spooky which I love. Overall an amazing game so much time and effort has gone into this and it really shows. Huge well done to the developer,"This game Is a masterpiece! It has some bugs so I think It Is the reason why It Is not in the official storie,yet. Buy I didn't have that ""feeling"" since The Room. I really Hope that some episodies Will come out in the future. Great great work! If you are in escape rooms/mind games you have to buy It!","Just started and really enjoy8ng the mystery nice graphics and story. Seriously loving part 2 wow it's my jam , wish there were kore games like chapter 2 in the game brillant with fantastic mission scene changes wow loooove it","I love this game so much. The first episode to play was so perfect for me because I love true crime shows and I love the investigation of true crimes and how they solve them. The second episode is soooooo creepy lol I was scared the most of the time but it was fun. Both episodes does require a lot of searching, so investigate everything little thing you possibly can and the discord for this game is very helpful/useful. I was sad once I completed it because I want more! I truly hope there is more to come but this was just fantastic to play."
