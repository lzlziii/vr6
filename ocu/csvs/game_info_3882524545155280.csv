This VR version has been really great. I enjoy the way the board looks, the ease of the controls, and the visual and sound effects within. The computer player difficulty should be enhanced. I'm no pro at Catan but I can beat the bots here far too many times. I really, really hope the developers will make more board games for Oculus. This is an awesome platform for board games; please, please make more! I recommend Axis and Allies. That game would look beautiful in VR. Any other classic board games as well; Stratego, Monopoly, Risk, etc. More card games are needed here too. Hearts, spades, and bridge for starters. Oculus needs more sit-down games for us 40+ folks that get dizzy as hell trying to play the action games.","I like playing with family and AI players. Have not had success with other online players...I get bored waiting to start a game. The game functions well and I love the graphics. Now , just would like to see expansion options.","Love the real game so much that I got the expansion packs... so why don't we have them yet in VR? Only real problem but other wise the game is solid but it's lack luster. You play it when your friends don't want to. Pros: solid AI, decent controls, beautiful animation Cons: it's the base game only","This game is amazing as always. Beautiful and plays well. It’s missing longevity. If there was custom boards or pieces, I’d buy them just to show support. But you can’t do anything. What you get is what you get. It needs more. Expansions, cosmetics. I’d like to unlock things to get me to play more alone or online. I don’t see a reason for them not doing any of this. So many people love the game, they would make a fortune by making us happy.","The main frustration I have with Catan is how aggressive and ruthless the AI can be when they rob you or use the Knight. It's become increasingly more aggravating. In a recent game, the 3 AI repeatedly, constantly robbed me so I never had any cards and lost the will to live. The other issue is new players (there aren't many yet) aren't forced to learn to play before joining your game, so you can end up in a very frustrating game with a new user who's tehifj to work out how to trade or something while you're drumming your fingers. New users MUST learn basic controls before playing rather than coming into a new game and frustrating others. It would also be cool to see how many games someone has won when they join a game."
