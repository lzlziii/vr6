Wack-Ammo,"You are armed with a Wack-A-Mole game and a gun to eliminate your targets in each new gallery. The trick is, you must keep playing Wack-A-Mole to keep your gun loaded. Each level ups the challenge and keeps you on your toes. Take your eyes of the board and it could end it all. Wack-Ammo is a fun throwback to the old light gun games of the 8 bit era. The hand drawn 2D graphics put you inside these classic shooters with the added flare of VR. * 9 Unique Levels * Different Guns & Wackers Each Gallery * Unlock Badges For Your ""Wall Of Achievement"" With Each Victory *Earned Trophies Come To Life In Your Home Gallery Wack-Ammo is a must play for every Quest owner.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Arcade, Shooter",English,0.2,Gaggle Games,John Ray Games,https://johnray32875.wixsite.com/johnraygames,"Jul 14, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3769999643110682/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3769999643110682&r=1, https://johnray32875.wixsite.com/johnraygames/wackammo",293.0 MB,What a cool looking game.
