OcuWeld,"OcuWeld is only accessible by students of Tulsa Welding School, The Refrigeration School, Inc. and partners. There is no guest access feature available. We hope to make this available in the future. OcuWeld Provides Training in VR on: • 19 modules covering TIG, MIG, Stick, Flux-Core and more • Specific welding process (e.g. tools and method) • Weld positions (e.g. 45-degree pipe weld) • Types of material (e.g. stainless steel) OcuWeld provides enhanced academic benefits for students in three primary ways: • Access: OcuWeld is fully self-contained within a Quest device. Students can access it any place or time, with or without internet, if they have their Oculus device with them. • Autonomy: OcuWeld is fully integrated with our curriculum and provides students the autonomy to drill down into process or positions where they need additional practice. • Amplification: OcuWeld amplifies the student experience by providing supplemental learning outside of the classroom environment.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Utility",English,OcuWeld v1.0.0.8,ForgeFX Simulations,Stratatech,https://stratatech.com/ocuweld,"Jun 16, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6904853139556100/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6904853139556100&r=1, https://stratatech.com/wp-content/uploads/STEG-POL-70006-3-Global-Privacy-Policy-1.pdf",574.2 MB,"I'm a current welding student NOT with Tulsa. I have zero access. I even reset my password just in case. I spent a good 45 minutes to an hour trying to login with my current Canvas credentials, and I could NOT GET IN. Waste of my time. So save yours and ignore this app until it's updated with guest access.",I love how OcuWeld relieves the pressure of learning to weld. I get to focus on my technique and don’t have to worry about messing up.,I am currently enrolled in Tulsa Welding School and have 10 plus years of expertise in the craft before enrollment. I can say that this program is 100% a waste of time. It is poorly optimized and in no way accurate to reality. The only reason why I am using this program is because it is required by TWS. To anyone who is a real welder who wants to try this out I recommend looking elsewhere. Ocuweld is not worth your time.,There is no access to the general public,so unrealistic
