Demeo is a Latin verb meaning 'descend, go down', and is a VR version of a traditional TRPG. For some, this game will bring back childhood memories. Several jobs and various campaigns will be enough to make you fall in love with this game. You can play this game with your friends or family, or just randomly meet people from all over the world. :) Currently, 7 heroes and 5 dungeons have been updated, and updates are continuing. Instead of a VR game where you move your body vigorously, how about rolling the dice and enjoying TRPG with friends comfortably? Was this helpful? If so, plz press the üëç button. :D","Love the game. My sons and I play ‚ÄúDemeo Friday‚Äù weekly but it‚Äôs getting boring. We win too much. It‚Äôs not just us. Comments during multiplayer is once its figure out how to master the characters, winning becomes virtually inevitable. If you want to keep players interested and playing Demeo, add the same feature as Beat Saber and many other games‚Ä¶ Difficulty: Easy / Moderate / Hard / Insane Give less XP for ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù and more XP points as the player moves up in difficulty. I guarantee you‚Äôll increase interest and make Demeo more challenging.","We bought an Oculus for eight other members of our family. For the most part it has been an outstanding investment. No matter where they are we can get together (time zones allowing) we can get play and enjoy this game. It is very re- playable since each time, even in the same section, things are changed. The players can choose different characters and learn to use the special abilities they have. We would very much like to see more of this type of game play where it is not such crazy fast action that you can‚Äôt enjoy the companionship of the shared adventure. Thank the people who brought this activity to us. My you continue expanding and developing this kind of game.","This is an amazing game. Love the characters, cards game play, and the graphics. My wife and I have just started playing the game. But we only have limited time to play. IT NEEDS A SAVE FEATURE ALL THE TIME, not just between floors. We have 3 kids and by the time bedtime is done we have maybe an hour or hour and a half to play. This means we can maybe play the first floor where the second floors seem to be longer, wouldn't know cause don't have time to sit and play it. Can't even get up to go use the bathroom without disconnecting and losing the game. Im 45 years old and after an hour I need a break for my neck. Again absolutely love the game but is unplayable for us with the current save set up. I even like the fact that if you die you lose your save. So unless you're in your 20's and have no kids and can commit hours to wearing the headset continually. You will probably like it but then be rotted you can't finish 1 book. Please please please fix the save feature and I would rate this game 5 stars. P.S. I am 45 and this is the first review I have wrote in my life. I really want to play this game.","I play this with my brother who lives 200 miles away. It's like we're there in the same room together playing board games like we did when we were kids. The graphics are fantastic, the game is challenging but fun and we never get bored of playing. The community are brilliant as well and always happy to help new players, so there's always someone to play with online."
