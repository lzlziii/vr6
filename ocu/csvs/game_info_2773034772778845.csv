I'm Canadian and grew up playing in 5 pin leagues. The commentators are a bit corny: barney rubble? Must be British.....no one out of the UK says that, do they? Overall, I highly recommend this game.","This game is overall pretty good. Physics are very good and ball customization is cool. Multiplayer works very well. I also STRONGLY RECOMMEND going to the settings and dragging the graphics slider to max resolution. Trust me, it looks WAY better and hardly impacts performance. I particularly love the feature where you can play your own music on a big screen above the masking unit just like the modern bowling alleys!","Love, Love this game. Great way to connect with family and friends for a fun family night, no matter where you live. Me (VA), my daughter (FL) and Grandson (ATL) love playing a few games together in our spare time. When I’m not playing with the family I’m in the local or multiple on line. Something for anyone who likes bowling, or if you’re looking for a way to get some moderate exercise. Try it you won’t be disappointed.","This game is great. It’s especially great because I can’t get out on the lanes all the time, so when I want to practice but don’t have the time or money to get on the lanes, this is where I go. I have two suggestions though. The most important one is a practice mode. I think it would be such a nice feature to add one so you can practice certain spares. Like if I wanted to practice picking up the big four, the 7-10, or the 3-6-9, etc. I can’t imagine how helpful this could be for bowling irl. The next one is to having dual oil patterns on single player mode. I’ve always wanted to play dual patterns just by myself, I’m not looking to challenge someone just to play dual oil patterns. Other than those two suggestions, I would recommend this game to anyone, whether they are a bowler or not!",I have been trying for 3 weeks to get a new update to upload and it just goes into query mode.I miss playing my bowling app. How do I get it to upload to the new version. Please help. Thanks.
