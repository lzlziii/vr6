Pretty much every complaint I had was revised and fixed. The one and only thing missing is the vibration when the cue hits the ball adding a little more realism. I am sure it will be added in time but I will be buying this game now! Great devs, great game!","UPDATE: Changed review to 5 stars with the return of the YouTube player! So nice to have this, game was too quiet after its removal. Now I can put on a YouTube radio station! Thanks so much for bringing this back! ORIGINAL REVIEW: The core game here is absolutely fantastic. The pool physics feel spot on and the controls I feel are near perfect. Once you line up your cue and hold the right trigger, the cue sticks to its axis and it becomes just a matter of powering the shot. This makes shooting a bit simpler in the best possible way. With aim assist off it’s still very challenging in the exact same way real pool because you still gotta figure out your angles. Doing a normal pool shot can work if you understand the Quests tracking limitations, but even playing “trombone pool” as I like to call it is extremely fun and satisfying. Giving this 4 stars for a few reasons (mainly the first one): 1. It’s too quiet. There used to be a YouTube player for lobbies to watch and listen together, which for a game like this really is a must-have. You need some music or ambiance, and I know the YouTube player was causing stability issues so they removed it, but in order for this game to truly be 5 star that desperately needs to come back. Golf+ had a YouTube player built in that works great so it can be done! Please devs, since the core game itself is pretty spot-on, I think redoing/fixing the YouTube integration should be very high on the priority list! 2) It’s a bit hard sometimes to do a normal pool shot as your right hand goes behind your body and loses tracking and if you hit the trigger at that point and try to swing it gets weird. This is more of an issue with the Quest itself really, but maybe something can be done? If not I’m happy to play “trombone pool”","I was excited to find a pool game for Quest 2 but this one is a letdown. The tutorial is painfully long and probably unnecessary since the controls are quite simple. The first thing I noticed when I started the game were the ATM's in the pool hall and once I knew where that was headed, I lost interest in the game. It also doesn't have a mode to play against a virtual opponent and that was another reason I uninstalled. There are better (and free) pool games out there if you're willing to look.","By far the best pool game you can experience with a head set. Very accurate to all controls. Once I played The Rack, I haven’t been able to stop. Banks, combos, scratches, gotta love it all. Stop waisting your time and get this game now, and join the great pool vr community. The dev is always making this game to perfection to the best of his ability in my eyes. This game deserves praise. Let’s play some pool!!"
