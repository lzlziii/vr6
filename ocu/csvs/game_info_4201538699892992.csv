Tank Battle,"Tank Battle is the fastest tank game ever. In the game, you have to fight with 50, 100, even 150 tanks. Your tanks must fire enemies and move as fast as possible, avoid enemy's bullets and destroy other tanks. There is no time for thinking in those battles, you have to shoot or be shot, destroy or be destroyed.",7+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Shooter",English,1.1,Galaxy Lab,Galaxy Lab,https://www.facebook.com/galaxylabgamestudio,"Jul 13, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4201538699892992/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4201538699892992&r=1, https://www.freeprivacypolicy.com/live/8b35ed74-fde6-4655-b0e0-1eeda6fe1442",147.7 MB,"This game reminds me so much of the old coin-op tank games I use to play in the '70s, '80s & '90s. It is fun to play, a little difficult to master, and worth the time & $$ to play. I would like to see more of an immersive play and use the VR experience to improve the game. I think it would be cool to be inside the tank and driving it and shooting at your opponents and not just watching it from above. It would also be great to be multiplayer against friends & family."
