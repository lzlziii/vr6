You can't dodge or block enemies attacks, the graphics look disgustingly bad, the cutscenes are long and make up more than 90% of the game. The plot is a rip-off of the matrix, what little level design there is feels very poorly made, almost as if there was something good that used to be there. This game used to be good, functional and had lots of good stealth puzzles that made me excited for the full versions release, but they scrapped all of the good parts which also took out the padding; and replaced them with boring, cyclical cutscenes that don't even have substance to them. This game could have been great. Shame the devs had to ruin it.",The demo gives one a short overview on what kind of a game this is. All in all the systems in place seem to be working alright and the bullet-time effect after punching enough faces is a neat hook that should probably be developed further. The overall feel reminds me of the newer Deus Ex games.,"All the devs can help you in the discord server And the game physics is amazing, it feels nice in slow motion, the story really shows what your playing for and what your goal is, theres an active community, and the devs work hard on the game 24/7 10/10 Great game!",The combat feels nice I can feel the power when I punch someone and I think the hacking is pretty cool but a little annoying and I kinda wish we had weaponsðŸ”«,Best game
