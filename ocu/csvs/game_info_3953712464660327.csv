Currently on the quest you can buy separately minigolf, pinball and contraption lab like apps which this one has them all. for the price, its a great deal. I really wanted to love the app. It was somewhat enjoyable, however there were some things that i came across that let down the gameplay slightly 1. the whack a max game in the break room i didnt know how to play/not sure if it worked/the mallet for the game dissapeared after i dropped it a few times 2. same with the golf club in minigolf. If you drop the golf club it sometimes dissapeard which means you cant continue and need to restart. Also one of my hands froze being unable to grab the golf club with both hands 3. in the contraption lab my hands also froze, i was unable to grab items which made it impossible to continue 4. is there supposed to be a pre made pinball machine? 5. its a bit tricky placing items on the pinball table/minigolf course as you need to reach as low as the ground to be able to put anything down flat. A simple pointing and guided lowering with the controller would make that much easier than physically having to move/reach all the way down 7. the walking movement in the game is a tad bit klunky/not completely smooth , same with swinging the golf club in minigolf it's a bit hard to easily hit the ball 8. the trays for the items that you can place are set high. If you are in a seated position you may need to stand up in order to view them more easily despite these things i still found the app somewhat enjoyable. Has the potential to be fantastic.",Really fun and could become great with future updates
