Really enjoyable experience. Cheers!","For me, the biggest advantage of VR is to be able to visit ""impossible places"". Things like the game ico: immense landscapes that are misterious but not threatening. This little gem is exactly that. There's not much to do other than trasverse the surreal landscape (many ways to go about it) and marvel at the sublime vistas. I wanted to buy the full version but the process did not work out, something might be broken. To the developer: thank you very much. This is something special"
