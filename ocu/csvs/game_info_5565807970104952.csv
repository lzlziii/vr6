The entire duration you are sick on the spot which have me even more anxiety. There a other much better options,I used it for a while which i have a height of fear and this app gave me the confidence and the ability to move on and trust myself. After playing the app i have less fear going on a high floor building and looking a bit closer from the balcony. Moreover i can step closer to my balcony at home. Thank you very much for that app!!!,This app is amazing. It simulate real life experience in a very realistic way and this is it biggest advantage. Because the feeling is so real facing situations were you on a high building makes your body to feel that you on a high building. In the the app you start with low levels of heights and slowly but steady you are advancing to higher levels. It's perfect! Thank you so much!,"An excellent idea for using virtual reality to deal with real fears In my opinion, it is also a good way to introduce virtual reality to new people Especially those who are afraid of it - a kind of soft landing in this world.","I think this app is a great way dealing with things that we are not dealing in our day routine, all of those little things that we afraid of and this app is giving the oportunity to slowly extract our little fears from our minds"
