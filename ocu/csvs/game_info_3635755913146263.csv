NokNok,"NokNok puts recording front and center while including all the features and functions of a meeting and collaboration space. Create your own room or NokNok yourself in. Solo or team, here’s what you can do: Podcasting Camera: Use our companion app to set points in space, and easily switch between different angles. Streams right to your pc with a built in recorder. Autopodcasting: The camera will record those that are speaking automatically. This feature can record up to four people and a zoom out of everyone. So you can record just by yourself with ease. Team Rooms: Persistent rooms. Ideal for remote teams that want to have their own pocket dimension in VR. Memories: Easily send images and text from your browser to your avatar and vice/versa. This works like Dumbledore's pensive, take things out of your head like memories. Blackboards: Boards how they should be, when things were done the chalky way.

I think lots of potential for this app. We are a team of 5 from different countries and are now using this for our weekly stand ups, the fact that I can reserve a room for a meeting later is awesome. It just works, super quick and simple meetings + the functionalities are useful, like I can quickly project my Google drive presentation and probably hands down the best whiteboard experience in VR. Really looking forward to see how this app grows further! And the team was super friendly when we had questions. Give this a go go go! Nok!","My friend sent me an invite link, then I joined their room immediately without any registration required. It's so awesome. Similar to Zoom meeting with random room number, but in VR.","NokNok is easy to adopt and use. I started using it for our remote team meetings and daily standups, it’s great!"
