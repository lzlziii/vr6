Townscaper VR,"Build quaint island towns with curvy streets, small hamlets, soaring cathedrals, canal networks, or sky cities on stilts. Build the town your dreams, block by block. No goal. No real gameplay. Just plenty of building and plenty of beauty. That's it. Townscaper is an experimental passion project. More of a toy than a game. Pick colors from the palette, plop down colored blocks of houses on the irregular grid, and watch Townscaper's underlying algorithm automatically turn those blocks into cute little houses, arches, stairways, bridges, and lush backyards, depending on their configuration.

I like how you can build tall or wide change the time of day or the color of the house. As you go through you learn what doing different things will do to your city. My only wish is that there was music or some sort of sound track that played in the background instead of just silence, also I wish how wide you build didn't effect how tall you can build and vice-versa. All in all this is a good game that i can spend hours at at a time playing.","I love the cosy, relaxing feel to this app, you can loose yourself in it and build the most fantastic structures. I would like a larger build area, it does feel very restricted. I’d also like add-on packs to add fancy bridges or roads , street furniture like benches and lamp posts. Little extras to deepen the experience.","This is a great game to just sit down and relax, the music is amazing, the gameplay is simple but not boring and it's quite cheap! Love the game and excited to see what comes in the future!",Very relaxing little game. Worth every penny!,"To play Townscaper is to enter into an experience not unlike watching your milk slowly dissolve into your coffee, or kicking the snow out from under your tires. Townscaper is not a fun experience, but rather an oddly satisfying one. There is no end goal really, as you simply build your town up from nothing within an ocean of vast emptiness. The goal here is the journey itself, as each addition to the town brings with it a feeling of unexplainable joyous accomplishment. The only thing I would love to see is the ability to walk through the streets of your town once it's complete. I think that addition would make it all the more perfect."
