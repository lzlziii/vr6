The environment and the music are all good and relaxing to play Yes, more different colorful environment please, more gameplay because it is just a demo now. Will buy the full game if more gameplay to come . Yes recommend this game for everyone to enjoy.","This is my first rhythm game in VR, so I was afraid I wouldn't make it, but the beginner mode is really ok for newbies. I still have a lot of difficulty levels to explore, and it's very complete for a demo! Lots of fun, great music, my arms (and heart) just have to keep up :D Thank you for this game! Can't wait to play more :)",Very nice music and a good game to play when I just want to relax,"The music and environment are very much to my liking. The Japanese style music is a pleasure to hear, and to beat to. This is such a refreshing alternative to the heavy and loud rock that's in the other drumming style games I've played. I really like that this game doesn't make fun of Asians, like some other games do. Everything worked beautifully, and I like getting sakura (cherry blossoms)! I found it tricky to go between the 2 beat types (I'll call them center and rim). Maybe they could have a setting to not include the rim shots (with a decrease in score). Or, maybe songs that have fewer rim shots, so I can get used to them. I didn't think it'd be a workout, but my shoulders and upper arms are sore. For a 'demo', this is 5 star. I look forward to following this game in the future. Thanks!","I've tried a few different drum type rhythm games, and this one really stands out. Great original music, fun visuals, and obviously the uniqueness of the taiko itself. My only problem is with rim shots. The area on the drum that seems to indicate rim shots is way bigger than what it actually detects. I could look at where my stick was hitting and see it say drum when it should have been rim. Only way I've gotten consistent rims is to hit from the side, and that's very hard to do in the more frantic sections. Would like to see this adjusted, or perhaps a setting for customization. Other than that, beautiful work, very fun, hard, and a good workout!"
