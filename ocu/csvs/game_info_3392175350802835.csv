It was very real to me and one of levels where you cut your hands off is HilariousÔøº I could not stop playing and laughing. It‚Äôs such a good game I recommend it to everyone you will not regret it. Hand tracking is ok but that doesn‚Äôt stop me from exploding with laughter. 5 STARS get the game,"This game is absolutely beautiful! Devs, this is literally the Mona Lisa of all vr games! This is definitely worth the 10 bucks. The physics are amazing and they remind me of 2015 boneworks physics. Something I want though is a life sized NPC so you can play and mess around with them. It‚Äôs good to have a friend even is multiplayer isn‚Äôt possible. Also, all the haters out there, the dev‚Äôs gave you this masterpiece and you don‚Äôt like it. Just because the tracking doesn‚Äôt work, doesn‚Äôt mean you can be a jerk about it. The devs are working hard to please all you people so I think that all you haters make a game and I‚Äôll talk crap about it too. The devs are also people and I‚Äôm sure the see these bad reviews and get so angry but they have to be professional about it. Hey devs, all y‚Äôall are great and don‚Äôt let anyone tell you otherwise. ALWAYS follow your dreams and be your own creative self. You get üçÄüç™üíµ‚ù§Ô∏è for all the blood, sweat, and tears you put in to this game. For the best, J_BOSS",It a great game. And maybe it's my head set but my get stuck under the boards sometimes or it's hard to pickup stuff. Over all I think it's a pretty great game. I think the tech is not all the way there yet for hand tracking,This game is fun Here's a cookie üç™,Me and my son are beyond amazed by this game we have had so many hours of fun we laughed so hard!!! Honestly the ingenuity and the aspects that they put into this game is phenomenal we are literally mind blown!!! It doesn't need to be complicated to be fun and that's exactly what this is it's just fun it's learning it's playing it's gaming it's giggling it's everything that you look for to sit down and relax and decompress. Thank you to the developers because this has been a huge positivity in this household!!
