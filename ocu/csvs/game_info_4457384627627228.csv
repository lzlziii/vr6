Cosmos Crash,"Cosmos Crash ‚Äì The first person shooting & puzzle VR game of Viriver Studio is now online. In this game, you‚Äôll be a space pilot with your ship trapped by orbits in the depths of the vast universe. By firing high-tech marbles, you need to make matches of three or more same-colored marble in the orbit before it reaches your ship. The game contains 10 different orbits waiting for you, think fast and aim smart to solve these problems! Spatial 3D orbit The 3D spatial orbits are the biggest highlight of Cosmos Crash. Surrounded by various shapes of orbits (crown, pipe, balance, gear, etc)Ôºå the game brings you immersive experience as if you are just there in the universe, giving full play to the superiority of virtual reality. Strategy Each of the 10 orbits has different strategies to clear all the marbles. Special orbit like accelerating orbit (speeding up the pass-by marbles) and balance shaped orbit (requires clarity of both side orbit) appears as the game progressed.",3+,Single User,"Roomscale, Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade, Casual, Puzzle","English, Chinese (China)",1.0.4,ViRiver Studio,Viriver Studio,http://virivers.com/en/work-game-1.html,"Jul 20, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4457384627627228/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4457384627627228&r=1, http://www.virivers.com/cn/policy.html",552.8 MB,"There seems to be an other version on Steam, which looks (from the pictures) much better. In this Quest 2 Version there are only a few levels, the menu and points does not work. After each game: 3 Stars, Best Score: 8888, Time: 123, Score: 1000 In the overview always 15/20 stars. Is this a ""Test""-Downgrade from the Steam-Version, which nobody has really tested? (I do not want to spend money on Steam again to test myself whether this version is realy what it seems to be)",I got addicted to a game similar to this game years ago playing it on a game console. But playing this game in VR is amazing ü§© and so much more addicting. To the developers: Awesome Job üëçüèª,"Love these games and bring it to the VR realm you've done a great job, one issue I struggle with is colour definition between blue and grey balls. A simple fix I'm sure or an option for custom colours would be great for the visually impaired üëç","It is a game that is entertaining. It needs to be polished a bit in terms of effects.
