Played the first one, “A fisherman’s tale”, it was original, concept and all but didn’t wow me, a little repetitive gameplay. Came to the second and… oh my! What a fantastic experience. The story, the puzzles, the gameplay, originality, voice acting, the scenarios. I teared up at the end, not gonna lie. Incredible, challenging. 10/10","I loved A fisherman's tale. Although I think I prefer the originality of the latter's gameplay, I must say Another fisherman's tale is just a fantastic game. Beautiful graphics, engaging puzzles, but most of all what a great adventure ! AFT has proven able to surprise me and amaze me as moved from one chapter to the next, particularly when it took me underwater. Big up to the designers !","What can I say that hasn't already been said about this game? A genuine masterpiece of storytelling, filled to the brim with vibrant visuals, engaging characters and an unsurpassed charm, that is so endearing, I want to forget it all and experience it all over again for the first time. Made me smile, made me cry... 10 out of 10 must play game!","I’m a 40+ female who would not be considered a gamer by any standard. That said - I love this game. It has a rich story, beautiful graphics and challenging-but-not-impossible tasks to advance. I thought A Fisherman’s Take was charming and thought there would be some degrading of the experience with the sequel. I was wrong. Another Fisherman’s Tale brings the story of Bob the Fisherman full circle in a satisfying and fun way. Total play time was between 6 and 7 hours. But I enjoyed every moment.","Beautiful/touching narrative with beautiful graphics, great puzzles and gameplay! Worth full price!
