Tavern Tales: Tabletop Adventures VR,"Tavern Tales: Tabletop Adventures is every tabletop enthusiast's pipedream made manifest. It gives you all the things that you know and love about traditional tabletop games, as well as giving both players and DMs tools that couldn't possibly exist in the real world - creating an immersive online TRPG experience like no other. Jump into your own personal tavern that’s stocked to the rafters with all the miniatures, dungeon tiles, scenery, and set pieces you could ever want. Take a break from the story over a round of ale, or have mug stacking competition. Use a range of tools that make building and maintaining your world take minutes, not hours, and most importantly - get lost in your very own fantasy world. Come together, role dice, slay goblins, and tell stories that live and breath like you do.",3+,Multiplayer,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Narrative, RPG",English,1.0.7,Studio Shinto,Studio Shinto,https://TavernTalesGame.com/,"Sep 30, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3934228993368485/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=3934228993368485&r=1, https://taverntalesgame.com/privacy/",484.2 MB,Exactly what I wanted for those day I wanna play dnd in person but cannot.,"This game has been a game changer for me. Going through college I would always play D&D with a group of friends, then we all graduated and went our separate ways. I've never been huge into roll20 as I really struggle to feel immersed in the game. Enter Tavern Tales. The controls aren't super intuitive, but I don't know that you can make intuitive controls and have all the functionality necessary. 5-10 minutes in and you're all set though. It's got great features that makes DMing WAY easier than being in person. The game still has a bug here and there, but the developer is actively working on it and is always improving. Map building is fun and amazing and you have all the tools you need to create an immersive game of D&D and still have the feel of being at a table with your friends.","As someone who watched this game grow from 2020, this game came a long way. The game allows you to create anything you want and build 3d maps. The community is very supportive too and its a great place to learn how to play. All this being develop by one guy too.","Needs free movement and turning instead of teleport and snap, more customization for coloring your avatar, and would like to be able to have telechonises for objects that are unreachable but are usable. I still don't understand how to play yet since the tutorial gives no instructions.",Not much to say here. I have been playing this with a group for the past few days staying up until like 2am. I’ve had a blast with the system even though the dice are definitely cursed lol. Overall great game tell your friends to get it.
