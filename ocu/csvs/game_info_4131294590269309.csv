Epiviosis,"Epiviosis is a VR FPS game created for the Oculus Quest 1 and 2. ""Epiviosis"" is the greek word for ""Survival"". Fast action, destructible environment, various kinds of enemies and vehicles to destroy. Benefit from various power-ups that fall from the sky. There are two play modes in Epiviosis: 1. Story Mode Earth, as we know it, is coming to an end. Try to get to the escape vehicle that leaves Earth for another habitable planet! Make your way through waves of enemies and reach your final destination. 2. Epiviosis Mode As you complete Story mode levels, Epiviosis mode unlocks the same levels. But, now, you have to survive against time! The longer you stay alive, the better your score!",16+,Single User,Roomscale,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Action, Arcade, Shooter",English,1,KM Entertainment,KM Entertainment,https://www.km-entertainment.com/epiviosis/,"Jul 7, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4131294590269309/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=4131294590269309&r=1, https://www.km-entertainment.com/epiviosis/privacy_policy.html",632.7 MB,"This is a fun shooter, well presented that keeps you on your toes. However this seriously needs leaderboards to have any longevity. I am in a position to share a favourable video review of this game with many people, unfortunately the developer has disabled the video recording capability (first time I have come across a developer doing this) for some reason. Worth the asking price.","It is actually a fun shooter game! It doesn't get much acknowledgment on FB or anywhere else, I think it is because of the name. I tried to record myself playing this game for my VR games review page on FB, but it will NOT allow me to do so. I was going to give this a good review and possibly draw people to it, but without gameplay video, there's nothing I can do. It is fun, challenging, and a little silly, but that adds to the fun!",Good graphics Good challenge Pick up and play arcade spirit. Has all the elements I need to get my heart pumping with the continuous onslaught of enemies and a simple but pulse pounding soundtrack that keeps you ready for more. $7 and Iâ€™m happy
