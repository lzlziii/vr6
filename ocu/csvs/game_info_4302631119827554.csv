Not a traditional vr title - more of a real-time action/strategy game - but its a really good game and worth your time! Combining the route based system travelling of FTL with a fun moment to moment combat system in each system/level. Controlling the ship to evade enemy attacks while countering back with a simple but effect shooting system - alongside random perks that are randomised each time you play, and rogue-like experience building carrying across each run to slowly build up your additional abilities and strengths. Check out the free trial if you're on the fence - that was all I needed to know it was worth the purchase.","If you are someone who likes to repeat things...this is the game for you. Repeat, Repeat, Repeat. The game actually has very little to do with skill and how far you make it each time before being sent to the start to REPEAT is more based on luck of the draw. I spent a great deal of time repeating this until I finally stopped using the game completely. Waste of time in my book.","First of I like to thank the developers for this vr gem which would still be a good steamdeck or pc and even android game. However this does not mean that this game has a shallow gameplay or crappy graphics. It is a mix which I found hard to believe that this will work out. But it does and it delivers. Gameplay You direct a spaceship through different sectors in a Faster than Light like map. The game itself plays like an rts, you set waypoints, fire laser and gattling cannons or rockets at enemies. There is plenty to discover, which I won't spoil here. Story I have beaten the game once yet and I feel that the story is engaging enough to keep me going. Graphics The game could be a tad bit sharper. When you zoom in, everything is crisp and really good looking but once you zoom out you get the typical edges a because the game is graphically not really top notch, I don't really get why this was a necessary design decision. However the game runs smooth at all times and I guess this is more important. The backgrounds however are beautiful and you feel as if being in space. One of the best quest 2 standalone games so far. Please keep up doing software like that.","A couple hours played right now and this is one of the best experiences I have had on the quest so far. Many of the games were starting to feel a bit stale and a repeat of gameplay from previous releases, this brings something new to the quest and I hope we start to see more creativity in game design like this. It's very similar to FTL-like games but with an increased focus on combat and a faster pace. The game has a great atmosphere, really nice controls and meaningful decisions to be made along the way which will impact your outcome of each run. Going forward I hope the dev team continues to support the game by adding in new events, ships, bosses etc to further increase the diversity of each play-through.","I enjoyed this game immensely. The leveling up progression is well balanced and the graphics are spectacular. The controls took a bit of getting used to but work well. This game is worth getting. Having beaten the game, I hope the developers continue to develop the game. Some minor balancing is needed (defensive mods are not useful). More depth in progression would be wonderful, I want to keep upgrading my ship! The ending felt unsatisfactory and more could be done for replayability. Multiplayer would be great. Battles can get a bit stale and incorporating new elements besides asteroids in a large rectangle would be a good step. This game is polished, bug-free, enjoyable and had potential to be even more. I look forward to updates and more content!"
