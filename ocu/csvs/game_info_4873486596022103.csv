Hyperbolica,"Travel through Hyperbolica, a true Non-Euclidean curved space like you've never experienced before. Hyperbolic space allows more volume to fit in the same 'space' than you'd expect. This allows you to explore enormous areas while taking very little time to walk anywhere. Building a mental map of your surroundings becomes impossible. Straight lines don't stay parallel. Traversing the map can result in unexpected rotations. And many more strange consequences that make you question reality. You'll also explore spherical space, which has opposite effects. For example, a reverse-perspective: Objects appear larger the farther away they are. It's difficult to explain, and first-hand experience is the best way to understand and build intuition about these interesting geometries. Hyperbolica was created specifically for this purpose, to break the mold and to have a fun experience in an alternative universe different from our own.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale","Touch Controllers, Gamepad","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro","Adventure, Exploration",English,1.2.0,CodeParade,CodeParade,http://codeparade.net/,"Jul 7, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4873486596022103/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4873486596022103&r=1, http://codeparade.net/hyperbolica/privacy.html",414.6 MB,"I love this game. It's one of the most unique games on the quest. It's open world in a totally original world with a totally original concept that will change your perspective... literally. Absolutely worth full price.

After about an hour of playing, I got a small headache, but it was a good kind of headache, the kind that came with understanding. The Hyperbolic world is so cool and being able to be put inside such a place and interact with it really helps me comprehend the concept this game uses at it's core. Props to the developer for being able to translate this geometry to VR, I had a BLAST!","Oh boy. This game. I think the best way to capture the true awe I experienced while playing is to give an anecdote about my first few minutes in the actual Hyperbolic space. I coincidentally wandered over to the maze section and about thirty seconds into walking around I was completely knocked off my a$s when I realized that four right turns don't get you back to where you started. I was giggling like a schoolgirl for who knows how long after that, especially because I had, several times mind you, said to myself ""No, that's not how that works. Look I'll show you"" and then proved myself wrong. The best part is, the game just kept doing that! I would come across something that seemed pretty straightforward, and then when I actually approached it, it would completely blow my mind. Especially that part in the NEMO, when you got there (You'll know when you do.) you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Just stunning. And the ending. Oh my god. I've never felt such fear just moving around. It felt like I was moving through an Alex grey painting. In fact, I actually had difficulty getting to the end because I couldn't bring myself to deal with the weird space. When I say ""fear"" I mean it. I really felt like a stupid monkey being shown a glimpse of the 4th dimension, it was TERRIFYING!! However...there are a few bugs I'd like to mention, mostly because I want to see this game refined into the most pristine VR experience possible, so here goes: - When closing out of the menu near interactable objects, I would accidently use them when I didn't mean to. - The draw distance is really iffy. I get that rendering this type of stuff is weird, but things blatantly appeared in and out of reality. - When using the spring in the farm section, if you look straight forward while turning, you can kinda see the two hemispheres break apart for a split second. If you saw the video he did on Projecting Space, you'll see what I mean. It's nothing horrendous, but it kinda broke emersion for a while. - When you have your map open in the NEMO, the eye piece doesn't follow you anymore. Which makes sense since you can see where the eye is pointing on the map, but I feel like if you made it so that you couldn't tell *where* the eye is looking in the map, you could fix it. - (Not really a bug, but something that peeved me a little) The transition at the end of the game, when you go to ""the area"" (trying not to spoil anything) it gave me a really bad scare. I thought my game just crashed, so when everything jumped back in and it was as weird as it was, I really had to collect my composure. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing, since the juxtaposition was really stunning once I finished pissing my pants, but I still think it could've been handled somewhat better.","I had followed the development of this game through the dev logs, and even after seeing all that this game still surprised me. I went into this game expecting a preview of what a non-euclidean game could be like, but this is a full non-euclidean game that doesn't just rely on the novelty of curved space. Besides the beautifully rendered environment, there are tons of side quests that show the oddities of non-euclidean geometry. The dialogue is lighthearted and full of humor. I could spend hours in each area exploring the interesting landscape and looking for Easter eggs. This game is quite possibly the coolest VR game available right now. This game has more content than many games three times its price. Everyone interested in non-euclidean geometry should try out this game.","Experiencing hyperbolic space in VR is absolutely amazing. In Hyperbolica you walk around in a surprisingly large world and explore all the strange features of it through many quests. You can walk around in a maze and constantly lose your orientation. Or fly a drone and explore this world in three dimensions. Or talk to all the residents of Hyperbolica and help them. There's just so much to do. The graphics (and the humor) is similar to ""Vacation Simulator"", really good and cute. Moving around can be a bit nauseating, but as long as you walk in the direction you are looking it's fine. It would be really cool, if you could build stuff yourself (maybe with a 3D paintbrush), though I haven't even explored everything. All in all it's an incredible and very unique game for a very low price."
