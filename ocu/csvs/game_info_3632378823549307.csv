I don't know if it was just because it was about 3am and I hadn't slept for over 24 hours or if it's actually a special game, but I had a very unique experience nonetheless.",When I heard about a Netflix VR game I was almost immediately intrigued. I honestly thought Netflix was done with anything VR as their VR app hasn’t received an update in so long. Apparently not and I am very glad they aren’t. This is a well made game/experience it’s fun and the controls are very polished. Honestly they are my favorite vehicle controls in any VR game I have tried. There isn’t too much gameplay here but it’s a fun experience.,"Very nice surprise. Stylized and intuitive but short (it’s free). Hopefully with this and the army of the dead vr experience—we are seeing a signal of a major shift into vr experiences/games for Netflix. they have the $ and can get the talent to make a large AAA story game, with vehicles, on earth or in space… the possibilities are endless. And hopefully Rockstar Games will follow!","Hi guys, i think that's a really cool start point! I really like the environment, the game fluidity and the music! However, in my opinion, there is some point that you can improve. A. Consider to include end user with different ability. A user with a pemanent or temporary or situational disability can play this game with one hans. You can steer with one hand already! You can give the chance by setting menù to setup a new brake button and pause the game when both grips buttons are released B. Color Track Problem. Playing the game, often I can't tell when the road curves. Maybe you can put a better contrast or different color between roads and curb. C. Design problem Sometime you can find a primary road that is divided by two lateral roads. By design you are invited to take that secondary road but when I try to take this I can't enter in that roads. I hit somethings and I must take the primary roads D. BioFuel IT's only my opinion and I really like biofuel, but i don't like that it's iconed by a food (food is another problem of our time). I hope i was helpful Best Regards Andrea","It starts out OK. Has a three small stops with a hint of a story, then just drops it completely and you cruise around an endless track getting apples. That's it. Collisions are annoying. Far too often you will try to go around something and just hit a glass wall. This is a play once, realize it has absolutely NO substance, Uninstall. Save your 20 minutes for something worthwhile. I don't know why they let it loose even for free on the app lab with such little content. Truly a waste of time. 2 stars simply because the little hover bike controls are ok. Still annoying with the terrible collision detection, but comfortable to drive. There are leaderboards to I guess incentivise playing again for a higher score, but it is so incredibly boring that you won't care about what score you get. You won't want to try and beat your score. Truly dull."
