Successfully played through all 10 rooms. Got stumped on a couple puzzles and every time it turned out the hint/solution was hidden underneath or behind something that I didn't realize moved.,"￼ You know the times when a game is so difficult it’s just not fun anymore? Yeah. You have an hour in the easy mode to get through the levels and at times you have to guess four colors in order to unlock a door code. Now the chances￼ of three will set you back a good five minutes? And God for bid you second-guess yourself wondering if you made sure to hit ￼the lock button after every single guess attempt . I mean come on, and the references to the order of the colors anywhere in these low color rooms? I don’t care how long you stared at any of the rooms you’re not gonna find any color pattern anywhere. And if it’s there, this should tell you it’s way too difficult to find. I really like the game otherwise mechanically graphics are ok, but way way too difficult that it’s not even fun.",This game should have gave you a option if you wanted snap turns or Smooth turns. Please fix it. It's not good for my eyes the way the snap turn is. Thank you,"Game looks and plays great , seriously fun puzzle game, . But game is full of surprises of which I enjoy such an adventure. Update.....well I'm unable to finish the game due to the impossible ring tone matching on the keyboard tried everything and seem to match the tones but no go . Restart chapter 10 times trying can't match. Game over for me I guess too bad unable to finish . Bummer"
