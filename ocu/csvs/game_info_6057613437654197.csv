If had one criticism would be the AI is overly aggressive. I'd like to see Time trials and ability to increase race laps. Racing games with homemade tracks is risky but the tracks I've used so far are pretty decent wide GP type circuits that are fun to use, maybe more difficult circuit will be added.","After playing the game for a bit, I liked what I was seeing, but most importantly I like the fact it's interactive but when I'm gripping two hands on the wheel the turning doesn't feel to natural and feel a bit delayed with my hand movement. I felt like I had to over extend both hands to turn the car left or right. Hopefully, with an update, the control and steering will feel more precise when turning.",Graphics pretty decent ..could do with bit of improvement on steering found left hand not always steering turning car. But very addictiveâ€¦what do you have to do to unlock next tracks win each race? Early days but very promising. Loved their primal hunt game my all time favourite!!!,It's already nice game It don't get too fuzzy or blurry and don't make you dizzy with the frame rate runs well it does need some polish tho and needs to be more busy and the controls need some work and I think it will be soon these people made primal hunt which runs really good and has good controls and graphics so I know once this is released it's going to look better and run even better I Don't like the steering tho I can't hold a plate and the controller so they need to loosen that up somehow where I don't have to hold the ends of the controller together to be able to steer other than that I love it it's a good company and they make good games so far so I love it at this price it'll probably be more expensive later,"Ive been looking for some race, and ive found pretty decent and dynamic game. Nice cars, tracks looks pretty cool to me. Wish there was a multiplayer here 5/5"
