Please develop a left handed racket with the left controller. 2) For the game on the court, allow for player to center in a location where they can hit the shuttlecock. I could not reach the shuttlecock unless I walked outside of my guardian. 3) Bad saber - quite fun to practice hits. But shuttlecocks often times appear larger than real life. The background is a bit dizzying, would be nice to have a stationary background like a badminton court. 4) is there a discord server for this game for feedback to developers? Thank you for developing this game, have been waiting for a badminton vr game for a while!"
