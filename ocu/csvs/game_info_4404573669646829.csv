Revomon VR,"Grab your slingshot and enter into this monster metaverse to collect them all ! The Revomon world is known for its mystery; a place where riddles are not yet solved. Here, players will assume the role of a Revomon Tamer and learn how their real-life gestures will let them interact with the virtual world we have created. Revomon crashed to Earth long before the evolution of humanity into the planet’s dominant force. As time passed however, these creatures were forced to adapt to the presence of humanity. As this change occurred, Revomon Tamers managed to bring great benefits to the human race by harnessing the incredible power of the monsters. Many mysteries still remain around the magical capabilities of the Revomon, as it seems that Tamers have only just begun to understand their true power. Three factions exist; - The scientists - The secret society - The anarchists You're potentially the future league champion.

What are you waiting for Trainers?",Just tried it and automatically can't play it. I'll go on and it'll say 100% loading for either 15 odd minutes and when it's done you have to wait for it to load up to about 1452 and I waited about 10 minutes for it to be not near done,Awful,The game forgets to mention anywhere that it is an NFT game that requires you to connect a wallet and give them your info to play. It is a rip off of Pokémon and this is their second attempt to it. They were sued by Nintendo for their first game. After developer response: 1st you guys were hit with a copyright from Nintendo because of the previous attempt to rip off Pokémon. 2nd you own the name to your game but every single thing in the game is a copy of Pokémon. All you did was change the name. 3rd You guys require a sign up on your nft website. Most games let you create an account inside the game without the need to sign up for a different product. NOTICE ALL THE FAKE REVIEWS POSTED ON THE SAME DAY LOL,I will give this game a 5 because it seems really cool but I don’t know how to join a game I am really confused on how to do it. Like do I make a account then log into it on the game or what????? Thanks
