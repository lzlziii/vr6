The puzzle mechanics are done really well and do work. The puzzles are fiendish, but some of them you will kick yourself when you finally get them. So use the functionality of the headset in genius ways. But some are very very hard.... or maybe I'm not as smart as I would like. Pros: Easy to pick up Clear graphics Hints available Cons: Some puzzles so hard it made me want to cry On the fence: Microtransations more Hints. I'm not marking this down for this as the developer is trying to make this work, but maybe if there was a say of earning more.. i.e. for every 5 you do on your own you get another? But impressive first impressions. Keep up the good work.",oh my days my iq went from 33 to 99999 after playing this game!!!!!!ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“,"An interesting puzzle game with some good ideas, but not all levels are logical or to solve without hint.
