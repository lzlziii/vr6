But I got the game one day ago and Iâ€™m almost done with the campaign showing that itâ€™s really easy even playing on hard. The best way to combat how easy it can be would be to introduce custom songs either officially or through mods. Another great feature that could be is multiplayer I would love to be able to go head to head with another rocker or play a gig together.,"The game is very fun and addicting. And I love it. The feeling of being a rock god is so fun. But there is one thing I have always wanted in this game, a Metallica dlc. Metallica is my favorite band and it would be awesome to play some of their songs. But overall the game is very fun. ps if you decide to add Metallica, Master of puppets had better be in there.",I really love the game its the vr version of guitar hero and I honestly hope 1 day they add mods so us players can play songs like master of puppets or seek and destroy or you know ACTUAL bands songs and theres a couple of band songs but us players need to opened to more options than what we have now but all in all its worth the purchase hope more people play this game so it blows up to be the biggest and they can add more songs and other content ðŸ˜ƒ,"I grew up playing guitar hero I still do. The only thing wrong with this is the lack of music but other than that beautiful. Well maybe the fact that when you activate ""star power"" the underwear that's being thrown at you looks like a 12 year old boys pair of underwear. ðŸ¤£ðŸ™ƒðŸ˜‚",So this game is great. The whole idea of this game is awesome! I love playing Pantera. Plus there are a few of the other songs that come with the game already that are awesome as well. The one thing this game lacks is more choices. I would prefer alot more metal and rock. Please let me know when there are more choices to choose from in this game.
