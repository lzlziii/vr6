I really like the huge skill tree. Although there needs to be more enemy types and variations. Potential Bug? Lastly, for some reason level 4 will not unlock. I have beaten level 3 several times now but cannot continue. Not sure if I am missing something - please advise!!!","Fantastic game that runs well, and has a satisfying game loop. would like to see a bit more enemy and environment variation on the campaign side of things but it's getting better with each update","I really didn't like this game at first and frankly devs you do that. That's where my main gripe is. I can get 40th in the world but can't beat stage 2 on easy in campaign. I mean, let us step into the game. You really have us feeling like we're really TERRIBLE at your game for the first many hours we play it. Due to your overpowered campaign and underpowered hero. Let people feel like a hero in campaign and earn their high scores in brisk mode. All that being said, it does get easier as you power up. Give yourself plenty of space. Your sword overheats so you can't cut everything. You must dodge and duck a lot. It's much more of a workout than I anticipated and is primarily what I use it for. Because you virtually can't beat stages for a very long time, the game gets repetitive. Sucks playing through the exact same stage 30 times. So I get on Brisk mode, which is still a one skinned environment that does not change. It is always cyber punk city. It has variations but if you run far enough, those variations repeat within that run until you die. New environments, a toned down campaign that's actually designed to beat and make players feel like a progressing hero and a few new songs would go a LONG way for player retention and initial enjoyment. But if you put in the work there really is nothing like the feeling you get slicing and dicing as a cyborg ninja in a falling city. Give yourself time and patience and you'll find yourself coming back to it!","Amazing game. There's not many games like this and Brisk Square did this type of game perfectly imo. There's a lot of variety of weapons which offers different play styles if you get bored of using the same old weapon all the time. With the skill up tree you can choose how you want to play the game like investing all your points into the sword or just spreading the points all out. All and all amazing game definitely worth getting the full version, would also recommend for those who love slashing or dodging games. üëç",its not quite there yet. there are a lot of bugs and the campaingn only has 3 levels but I'm really looking up for the other updates because the game is pretty fun to play. One important thing I hope they will add is more abilities to add some more variety.
