BonsAI,"BonsAI is a narrative experience featuring hand tracking. A novel plant virus threatens the world's vegetation. As the new assistant to a top botanist, you step up to save the day while avoiding the clutches of an evil agribusiness. From the developers: We met for the first time in March 2020 during METL’s very first Immersive Media Residency in Winston-Salem, North Carolina just as the world was beginning to understand the seriousness of COVID-19. BonsAI sprang from a wish amidst the heaviness of the pandemic: to give people a memory of saving the world by blending nature and technology. With this short narrative experience, we wanted to provide a radically positive vision of a possible future. We hope you enjoy it.",3+,Single User,Roomscale,"Hand Tracking, Touch Controllers","Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Narrative",English,1.0,"Trent Spivey, Alex Moro and Fernando Goyret",METL,https://www.uncsa.edu/metl/residency-program/2020-residency.aspx,"Apr 5, 2021","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4385310621483433/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4385310621483433&r=1, https://sites.google.com/view/bonsaiprivacypolicy/home",656.5 MB,It will grow on you….,wow. best handtrack game.it is the future.amazing beautiful.and Full of ideas，i love it so much，must five stars
