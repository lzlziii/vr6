I was the first of everyone that played that learned how to escape the map and explore a bit more. The developer blocked off all ways to get out of the map but he put stuff outside the map meaning he wanted people to find it. In 1 day of the game being out the community discovered how to fly. Using sand blocks and your head you could fly around. He took that out too. These things made the game so much more fun and yet they were taken away. I will not stand for this. (Dev if you are reading this, please at least add back the blocks ðŸ¥º) Edit: This game is lit now although he didnâ€™t add the blocks back he added a fly mod and a bunch of new stuff to mess around with.",Very good game about Monkeys
