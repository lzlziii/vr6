Work Window,"Frustrated by how difficult it was to find the time or contacts to engage with industry to explore our career options, and the unengaging traditional career resources available, we started Work Window so students could access the experiences that they actually want to use to help decide on a career path. Through interactive virtual reality job shadowing and informational interview experiences, we transport students to the workplaces of their interest. Work Window allows them to feel like they are really there, in order to narrow in on their career options, and build the confidence to take the next steps in their career development journey.

There is no free content or sample content. It’s purely a VR interface to the developer’s subscriber library. It’s totally useless as far as being on the Meta Store because the description fails to disclose that a subscription is required for the app to work.
