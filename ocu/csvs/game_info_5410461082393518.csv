Manic Macacas,"Welcome to Manic Macacas! This is a fun, well made gorilla tag fangame! Me, as the creator, put my heart and soul into making sure this is the funnest, best game possible! We have multiple developers from hit games like: Rat Party, CatosVR: Multiplayer Horror, and Bad Tag!! Go out there and explore your environment, you chill in a cave but the elevator will take you some place new! Put on all kinds of cosmetics to look your monkey best! And don't be a bad Macaca, we punish those! Now have fun!",3+,"Multiplayer, Co-op","Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Action, Adventure, Social",English,1.1.2,ZenekVR,ZenekVR,https://linktr.ee/zenekvr,"Feb 13, 2023","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5410461082393518/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5410461082393518&r=1, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kx9ClIAKKxIyFgAdipbJpOgAii7uFH6Jz-0CtyDdgtY/edit",211.5 MB,It a good game just need a lot more player and u should add horro to make it more fun I’m making a video for u guys so 5 starts,Why ain’t no updates been added it’s kinda sad.. oh and Edward from catos got ride of the manic macacas poster good game base just no updates,I like the cartoony graphics,When I played the game I find no people so 2 stars sorry,"The game is amazing I highly recommend but a fix that could be good is to fix the elevator, you can easily get stuck in the floor. PS: Is someone called Omar in the dev/moderator team? Because my friend on VR called ""Funky_Alleo"" (VR Name) was supposed to apparently be a moderator."
