And I’m so impressed they actually upgraded the demo! The options are many, beautiful scenery, great music, punches are perfectly timed plus a great all around workout. I share the link often! Beach Vibes is my favorite. Just waiting for a sale to get the full version. But truly, the care and quality they put into the demo, and willingness to share that free, is worth the full price for full version. (Hitstream should be out of App-lab and in the store!)",I love this app!,"Love love love this fitness app. Its fun...it switches things up alot so I don't feel bored...its 360 & FREE ....the demo is impressive, the music makes me want to do more, ...and sooo much fun that I'm purchasing the upgrade. And NO monthly subscription This one is a no-brainer to check out.",Not very fun compared to beat saber.,Hitting doesn't feel good. This game might've been ok 7 weeks ago but the competition is getting harder even on app lab.
