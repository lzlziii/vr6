Extreme Escape,"Have you ever wondered how it would feel to travel in a hot air balloon and fly above clouds? Have you ever wanted to face your fear of heights and enclosed spaces? Perhaps you wanted to become a pilot and test your critical thinking skills. Looking for a breathtaking experience? Try Extreme Escape. You are the pilot of an experimental balloon that has suffered a serious malfunction. You’ve just lost power and your life support system is damaged. The balloon is leaking and you’re losing altitude fast. Get out of this situation by repairing all devices and regaining control over the balloon. The capsule contains plenty of tools and equipment necessary to fix the airship and land safely. The onboard computer shows emergency procedure codes that you can follow using your tablet. Additional help becomes available once the radio is reset. It is a room-scale experience. In a smaller space, you can use a teleport or just pull yourself in the capsule using your hands. Have fun!",7+,,https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/6565887433453377/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=6565887433453377&r=1,,,,,
