Transcend XR,"Transcend XR is a full featured Internet Browser in Augmented Reality. Pull content directly from the Transcend XR Browser into the Metaverse. Runs entirely on the Quest - no PC necessary. Pull images from any website and place them in the physical world. â€¢ Pull photos from the cloud. â€¢ Create mood boards. â€¢ Cover your room with posters and stickers from floor to ceiling. â€¢ Create mind maps, study spaces and memory palaces. We see a future where displays appear out of thin air and magically hover anywhere we desire, where we can fill rooms with virtual objects that are indiscernible from the real world and a single space offers infinite possibilities. OK, so weâ€™re not there yet but Transcend XR is our first small step on an exciting journey. We do hope youâ€™ll join us! We all need a bit of support and encouragement at times. If you like what you see then tell us about it. We have loads more features we want to add and will be overjoyed to hear the thoughts of the community.",3+,Single User,"Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Apps,"Media & Streaming, Productivity, Utilities",English,2.2,Transcend XR Ltd,Transcend XR Ltd,https://www.transcendxr.com/,"Apr 7, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/5843171399045320/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=5843171399045320&r=1, https://www.transcendxr.com/privacy",245.6 MB,Currently there is no native Quest 2 app for accessing Xbox came streaming so itâ€™s great that this app exists. It does what it promises. The augmented reality browser searches the web just fine and plays Xcloud games without any noticeable controller lag. I use it often. I do wish that the you were able to move windows from a distance. It would also be nice to have a way to level the screen when placing it. A few environments would be cool too especially since the augmented reality is black and white. Iâ€™d even purchase them if they were made available. Playing video games in different locales would be an awesome add-on.,"Can this app can have multiples rooms, living room, family room, and bad room. ( like a room folders ) So photos can placed into different types of room folders. So I can just open or go to different room folder for different photo. If possible, is good idea to have multiple different room folders. Also if possible, this app can open photo from VR local file folders storage if possible. Please Can this app able to view 3D SBS left right 3D ( lr3d.jpeg ) photo if possible. Please First, thank you developers for this interesting Brower, it is one of the kind, new idea. Yes please continue to have more functions and options, because this is going to be an useful fun VR browser to explore. Can this app able to import and export and save photos in the VR storage if possible. Yes , I do recommend this browser for everyone to enjoy. 5 stars app.",I like the app however wish it could be placed from a distance. I hate having to get up to move the screen around. Also it needs a way to tilt and level it from afar as wellâ€¦,i canâ€™t lie this is the best move when some time is on your hands and you want to play somethingâ€¦i love when items are as advertised. hope you guys keep improving it or make a better version of but it,a really good piece of software and it does what it's supposed to. This ist a must have for all Game Pass User. (and PS now ðŸ˜„) we users are of course honest and also give feedback to the programmer ðŸ˜‰ please add a curved mode and shadow under the extracted images the browser window. Thanks.
