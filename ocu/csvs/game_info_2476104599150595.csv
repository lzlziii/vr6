I was preoccupied with the collectibles (envelopes) but that being said, this is very much like Moss (if you enjoyed that). The graphics are spectacular, the linear campaign averaging at 3 hours and the collectibles you search for in each room keeps you going. I found minimum bugs besides a very annoying one! An envelope I plucked from the ceiling disappeared after I forgot to pick it up and returned to it. I actually restarted my campaign because of it. Don‚Äôt forget your envelopes if you‚Äôre a collector! Another thing to mention is the ability to go between third person and first person views of the character of Alice. It‚Äôs pretty cool seeing All the tiny objects become a normal size. This is necessary to solve puzzles.

The vr mechanics and movement are brilliant. I love how the environments wrap around you as you go from one room to another rather than fading in and out to another location. The environments are rich and very fun to look at. I really like being able to go into the scenes sometimes to solve puzzles. The only major complaint is that many of the talking scenes are very dragged out. It gets tiring after a while and I feel like half of the game is just talking. Also, a hint system would be highly appreciated. Overall, this is a very well crafted and unique game!","By far one of my favorite VR games! It‚Äôs long over due for part 2! Absolutely incredible, the attention to detail is remarkable. My daughter and I didn‚Äôt want to leave the game. A+++++++","As someone who started out programming thousands of lines of code to play a text game before PCs were a normal thing, I‚Äôm mind-blown at the beauty, mechanics and game-play. I‚Äôve been playing video games for over 40 years, and this game is fun and gorgeous!"
