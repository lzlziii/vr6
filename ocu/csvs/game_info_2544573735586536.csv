Overall it’s a great game it just needs a few improvements to make it complete.,I was having a lot of fun with this game running around with a sniper and blowing peoples heads off. Until I realized there where level requirements to unlock each level like it was a stupid phone game. Then I pretty much lost all interest in playing it because I had already sunk hours into the game and I can’t complete the main story without getting it all confused because I have to play every level again for the smallest achievement to get more story out of the game. Unless your into that sort of thing same your money onward has better gunplay than this game by a mile.,Doing my head in I can't pass this section . I get over run every time. Only 2 bloody Germans left and they over run me. Stopped trying now waste of money for me . The scope keeps turning black so you miss your chance and reloading is a farce. Some serious upgrades need to be sorted before I buy again from this company and I know a lot have complained about the same problems.,"This game is great, the people who complain (specifically about mission 3) are complaining because they suck at aiming… the gunplay is great, reloading isn’t finicky like some people are saying, it’s just a different reloading system in comparison to other vr shooters. Overall, it’s an amazing single player game and I honestly liked following the story",This isn't a Phone Game. there is no reason whatsoever to lock the levels behind challenges in other levels. Also the bugs really make the game unfun to play. It feels like a half baked game that should've been made correctly but wasn't. It calls itself a Sniper Elite game but doesn't compare to any of the actual games at all. What a disgrace to the series.
