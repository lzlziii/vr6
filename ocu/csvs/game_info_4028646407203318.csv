Space Savage was one of the first games I played when I got into VR last year and now coming back to it, I apprective all the makings of what a great little game it can be. First run on a Quest 2 and now Quest Pro. Intuitive controls, funny, hidden things to find ... wanting to know about the story line etc. Haptic controls options would be nice. Also personally, an option in taking my hand off the grip for accelerator for full stop or slowing down to full stop would be nice. I tried the option for ""manual rotation"" (IIRC) but didn't notice a difference? I'm hoping for more buttons in the cockpit too. Whether they do an actually function or a funny noise, I don't care. Hoping rockets or laying own mines etc for more destructible stuff. Assembling tasks would be great too. I guess I'll just have to wait. üëç","Game is pretty nice. One gripe I have is that, lacking haptic feedback, I miss the joysticks if I try to grab them while looking somewhere else, and I don't realize that I'm not holding them only when they don't respond. Not sure how to fix this, other than spacing them out more and making the grab areas enormous.","Oh PLEASE release this SOON!! I cannot wait! This is one of the coolest games I've demoed, and the feel of piloting through space is exactly what I'm looking for. Such simple game play, yet amazingly effective in every way! Humorous, great graphics, and I'm tapping my toe in anticipation! Love it!!! UPDATE: Really hoped to get in the testing mode, but alas didn't get it in time. Still waiting for this, but it's taking a while. The anticipation is getting old, but they need to make it good, so I get it.","I'm the kind of gamer that's too critical to appreciate alot of great games and this one impresses me beyond any expectations.... The controls of the ship, asthetics even how combat works all feels just so f***ing fresh and amazing. I love this my only complaint is I can't buy the full title right now.",Nice to see a clean crisp game in development. The cockpit is really well done and you can feel the movement when spinning around completing the free level. I look forward to the release.
