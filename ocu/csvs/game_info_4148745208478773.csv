Robots programmed to live like humans...but frozen in a particular time and culture...with humans looks, mannerisms, habits, motivations, and identities. Their physical attributes are how the past thought robots would look like. It gives you something to ruminate on afterwards.","Yes, yes it is. Who would have thought that classic point & click mechanics translate so well into VR? So if you're an old pal like me, growing up with Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle, you'll probably end up liking Retropolis a lot. It's short but sweet, very straightforward and very enjoyable. And generally speaking, developers trying to push the boundaries of VR and try new things deserve every support.","This is a lovely classic-style adventure puzzle game, nicely presented for VR. I enjoyed the simple “gumshoe and damsel in distress” story, the artwork and music is outstanding and the voice work was pretty good as well. I thought the puzzle difficulty was just right; most were straight forward and a couple were somewhat tricky but very logical. While the length of the game was pretty short (an hour or so), I got the game on sale so it was more then worthwhile for me. Obviously a lot of work was put into this project and it shows. Finally, I really appreciated the nice extras that become unlocked when you finish the game; they includes the really lovely soundtrack and some great concept images. I look forward to the sequel currently under development.","Retropolis may be a short experience, but it delivered a couple of the most engaging hours I've ever spent in VR. The characters are charming and believable, the environments are beautiful and lively, the puzzles and interactions feel polished and clever. Every element of the game works together to make one delightful whole. Even when one elements slips, like a less than perfect line delivery or a hiccup in some interaction, I found myself unbothered because I was enjoying the experience as a whole so much. I really cared about these noir cartoon robots... I can't wait to play the sequel chapters are they come out and see how Peanut Button builds on this very strong foundation!",I found this game to be fun. It is a short game but also inexpensive and well worth it in my opinion. The story is easy to follow and the puzzles aren't too difficult but do require some thinking. I was fully immersed while playing. Retropolis 2 has just released and I can't wait to play more. Check this game out!
