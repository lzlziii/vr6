Tsuro - The Game of The Path,"Relax in a serene temple garden, and enjoy a blissful game of simple strategy, based on the award-winning board game. Create your own journey with Tsuro: The Game of the Path. Place a tile and slide your stone along the path created, but take care! Other players’ paths can lead you in the wrong direction - or off the board entirely! Paths will cross and connect, and the choices you make affect all the journeys across the board.

I like that you can walk around the environment and even watch the playground from the roof. The details, the floating tree leaves and animals also lift the mood. If you really like board games, you will enjoy it, otherwise, you can get bored quickly. This game is also good for just meditating in a pleasant environment. Actually, I bought the game because of the beautiful Asian environment and to have a board game in VR. The graphics could easily be better, but it's still nice. It's worth it on sale.","I play this game every evening before I go to bed. There is a lot of strategy involved, but it’s so peaceful. Take the time to learn the different ways to play- it’s worth it!",I bought the game when it came out just to have a board game but totally pulled me and sticked. Still my favourite ✌️,Got this to be able to play board games with others. This game is solo.,"The game itself is a good enough VR implementation of the board game, but just playing against the computer opponents gets old fast. Tried to play a human opponent multiple times, but was never able to connect to another human player. I read in another review that they were disappointed that they could not see their opponent, just their game piece, but I was frustrated to not even be able to get to that point. Not sure if just not enough players in this game or what, but I’d give it a much higher rating if there was actually a player base. Maybe they could lower the price to get in more players? Until then, its too repetitive to just play against the AI. Has promise though. Edit: So it seems like the reason I couldn’t get a multiplayer game is that you can only play with people you’ve invited into a game. No wonder I was waiting so long for an opponent, I thought I would just get matched with someone else seeking a game, but I guess not. Was not clear at all about this when attempting to find an online game."
