I might change my score later but for now it 5. I enconter only one probleme,,,, I do not know if it is a bug or me doing something wrong,,,,, When sailling after a few minutes the sterring wheel change position getting verrey closed off my chess even trought my body... making difficult to steer,,,if you used the wheel....is it me or a bug if it me some one help me out solving this! If it a bug,,,now you know! It have an exccellent potential....I love the way it done while sailling,,,,the sun set,,sun rise,,,night sailling and day great .... The island graphique (deffenition) need improuvement they are very low resolution... and docking could be more realictic,,,my sailboat pass aff way trough the dock..... Would be great to add a few distant islands with a compass on the boat to practices navigation,,,, imaging sailling long distance to discover distant island ,,, I recomend it for all peoples who like this king off game and relax while you practice basic sailling skill....","After a really sh%t%y day at work i go to this every day ,i find it more calming than most of the meditation experience apps, really lovely i just want to keep on sailing x",I did the treasure hunt game! I am looking forward to improvements. I noticed some 3D txforn problems toward the end. I took pics. How can I help?,"I took a fancy to this app not only because I thought it would be a cool VR experience, but how it provides a mental retreat and promotes a peaceful environment that can have a tremendous impact on your health as the environment you're in or placed in can make all the difference for behavior. For example, take silence; it is by far the best atmosphere because it's where our mind goes and what our mind creates to try to make sense out of what we are going through that makes us believe and behave in at that moment seem real. Yet, I only had this app for a day and already I love it as you have created a place that soothes my disturbed mind and I would recommend it to anyone who was suffering from a mental illness! I named my boat 'TEENIE TINY TITANIC' LOL! I even stood at the front of the boat like I saw Jack do in the movie Titanic, and yelled: ""I'm King of the World!"" Thanks for that option! I thought it was even cooler of all the options in the menu that you can have for gameplay like: go sailing, treasure hunt, and multiplayer mode. Although, I would love to see, maybe... gameplay where a wakeboard appears in the back of the boat that you can ride on while the boat drives. Or, maybe, what if... you could water ski or waterboard? Also, an option that allows you to just sit and enjoy the scenery would be nice. Other than that I look forward to seeing what else this app comes out within its updates, it's so worth it and pays for itself because you can't put a price on mental health.","It's very cool even just standing on the boat with nothing but the blue ocean and blue sky. Nothing really to do, just enjoy the scenery. Wish they add a nigh sky, a changing variety of clouds and weather, seeing a storm in the distance and then being inside huge waves; more land on the horizon and small islands we can visit; and more tutorial on how to operate the sailboat."
