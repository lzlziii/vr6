Tx. They really put in the time and effort to make their customers happy and fix any issues. Ran for only 1 game then crashes every single time now. Can't exit out, can't do anything. If you hold the power switch extra long the system will eventually reset.","This game is pretty underrated and is somewhat hindered by being compared to the PC version (Skylines) too much. It‚Äôs a different game and benefits to be played differently than the PC counterpart. E.g. instead of trying to build big and fill the 1 tile as fast as possible then play more relaxed and slow paced, zooming in to street level now and then to walk around and enjoy feeling like being a citizen amongst the others, imagining you living there, enjoying the views and checking out the neighbourhood but with the power to make the changes you want. Playing it that way really made me enjoy Cities: VR a lot, even more than Skylines (there I felt disconnected to my city once I returned to it). I actually managed to refund the game but purchased it again once I realized how good it was if played it in the right way. Sure, the graphics aren‚Äôt up to par to Skylines, and there are some design decision that could have been made different to make this a better VR experience (i.e more simplistic but cleaner graphics suitable to less capable hardware), but for a pretty complex city builder running on the Quest in standalone then Cities: VR is fantastic way to relax and enjoy building a city. Feedback to FTG: - My biggest gripe at the moment is to not be able to ‚Äùscale‚Äù the city into a ‚Äùminiature‚Äù. As it is right now the world feels unnecessarily flat as head translation is not reflected at distance (it‚Äôs pretty much only observable at street level). Nevertheless, it‚Äôs really a superb feeling to build a city on the Quest 2 (in standalone), and impressive amount of content that this game really deserves higher review scores.","The game was a little confusing at the beginning, and the developers have improved the game a lot since then, my only complaint is that the map size really limits you, I know that I personally would like a larger map to de densify my city, and have more distinct regions. It just feels like the game ends too quickly with the small area. Besides this, the game is really great, and I have little to no complaints about the rest of the game","Picked this up on sale, haven't played for long but so far really enjoying it. Absolutely love going down to Street view and being able to wander the suburbs and walk anywhere. As far as city building sims go, keeping in mind the limitations of the quest 2 hardware, this one is fantastic and I'm impressed what they've been able to do with such limitations. Great game and plenty here to keep me coming back. Nice one devs.","I love city-building games, and I have all of them the Oculus has to offer. And I truly appreciate the attention to detail, opportunities for creativity, ambient sounds and lovely music in this game. It is obvious the developers put great care into making this game an enjoyable experience. BUT!!! I did have a lot of difficulty and frustration getting started with this one. Despite doing the tutorial several times, restarting multiple cities, and watching the ‚Äúgetting started‚Äù video on YouTube, it took about 5 hours and many cuss words to realize the water supply thing has to be directly connected to the water treatment thing via pipe. Before doing that, there were always sewage buckets hovering over my city. My people were sick, there were abandoned buildings everywhere‚Ä¶a regular slum. This fix might have been obvious to other folks, but I missed it. So if anyone else is having this problem, connect these two things, and that might fix it for you. Good luck and enjoy! üòÉ Addendum: The more I play this game, the more I love it! Very happy with it now. Updated to 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è!"
