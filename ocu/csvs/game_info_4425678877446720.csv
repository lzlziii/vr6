I must admit I had let this game fall down my playlist over time, not because it was bad, but just because in the world of VR games you are constantly wanting to try new games and you often forget about other games in the process. Then I saw that this has had an update so I checked it out. 15 minutes later, VR Blast had rocketed back up to the top of my must play list. The changes this game has gone through since I first played it are astonishing. It's so polished, well presented and insanely addictive. There is potential here for multiplayer where two players occupy the same arena battling to get the most points or even co-op. _______________ Very enjoyable. Look forward to the updates! I've played this when it was first available and I the developers and continuously improving this game. It's changed so much and it's so much fun. Great music, addictive gameplay and fun weapons, this is definitely worth buying.

This one will keep me entertained for a long time. One of the best games I’ve purchased to date.","This is literally if you took the game Super Collapse! from 2001 and modernized it to be in VR, and I like it. Using guns instead of just clicking like back in the day plus upgrades to the weapons and various powerups and obstacles. Certainly has upgrade potential like all the various versions of Collapse that are out there.",The quick pace of the game and various levels and upgrades makes the replayability factor great. Nice refresh with simple gameplay rules and an urge to do more as you go through each level 👍 recommend!
