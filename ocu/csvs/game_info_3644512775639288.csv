TrainerVR,"TrainerVR is a unique physics-based VR train construction game. In TrainerVR you can create from simple tracks to an elaborate rail network, just like the wooden piece game, but to the infinity and beyond, and drive the trains inside your creations! Have you ever feel the despair of running out of tracks just when the fun was sparkling? Have you ever dreamed about a huge train network connecting towns, going up and down, intersecting and looping? If you liked building with your own bare hands, you’ll feel the same in our limitless VR world and see your dreams come true. But this is not only about the destination; it's also about the journey. Enjoy building your structures, growing more complex, while fighting against Newton’s laws. Once the job is done you can place as many trains as you want and ensure everyone’s safety avoiding crashes acting like a profesional train traffic controller. Once you go track you can't go back.

The problem is a lot of the train tracks that come in real life for whatever reason are amiss. There are Y tracks but Z track connections are absent. - those are absolutely must items and using Y tracks to create Z connections is basically throwing off the entire program since it is extremely bad. Al ot of C tracks are way too sharp on the turn and require creating prolonged S patterns. Overall missing a lot of basic critical tracks but it is probably the best toy train Sim in vr out there,Here’s a suggestion what about multiplayer? Imagine building train tracks with your friends that would be amazing!,"I love this game.As a model railway guy , this was a great experience;but i was disappointed by the lack of diversity with the trains. Try adding a mallard/flying scotsman/Tornado /class66 or 37 as I would love that. Also could you please add a countryside map or city map .","I played this game on PS VR and loved it. I am playing it on the Oculus Quest 2 and still love it. I wish you could fit more elements on the screen at once. As it is, I was building a pretty elaborate layout when the aliens started taking away my pieces. If not possible to have more pieces, maybe adding some kind of ""memory counter"" near the top would help with planning. Figuring out the logic for switch tracks and such is something I really enjoy. It's cool sitting back and watching multiple trains run around the track, stopping at cranes or passenger stations based on how you set up the buttons. My only other critique is that it would be great if you could somehow share creations. My brother has the same game and it'd be cool if we could show off what we built without having to take picture or record video. Other than that, please keep up the development. No other train app is quite like this one.",All right now I’m not gonna draw this out but the game is perfect not perfect but you know it’s beautiful and somewhere no here’s the things that I would add or like to be added most likely I would want a little more riding the trains no I’m not saying the trains suck I’m just saying I me a little more train varieties like one with a coal hopper or tender for all you British people a lot of other varieties of Hogwarts train caboose all those. Another map because I mean the desert map after a while The map just kind of gets pretty boring after a while anyway there is a much probably what I would want know what I would want like a foresee map or in the winter map those would be cool What besides all that were made the game kudos to you￼ i’m pretty sure that I use it sorry I I feel like I’m drunk it’s like what 8:25 PM I am basically drunk at this point anyways this is a good game but just a little more trains or something you know it’ll kill him kill niceness you know I’m saying I’m gonna stab auto correct it’s jacking up my entire thing might her speech Open anyways good game bye.
