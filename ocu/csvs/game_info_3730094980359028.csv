Descent Alps,"Full body motion-controlled skiing meets rhythm-based gameplay in a sublime VR experience. Speed down steep mountains as you carve a path through the powder that connects your movement with the awesome soundtrack and the rhythm of the slopes. Control your descent down the treacherous mountainsides using whole body motions. Lean into the hairpin turns, and hunch down when itâ€™s time to carve the skis and make the gates. The paths down the slopes are randomly generated based on the soundtrack, so moving with the music improves your skiing skills and boosts your scores, while making the game feel even smoother and more realistic. With over 60,000 downloads of the demo version, Descent Alps has been finely tuned to deliver an invigoratingly real experience, while remaining comfortable and fun for pro skiers, gamers and total newcomers alike.",3+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Music, Simulation, Sports",English,"0.5.3

It would be a pretty good game if it was easier to control the turning and if they were more maps.,"I really want to like this game and do some casual skiing. I tried the demo before purchasing the game. It taugbt you to lean right and left to steer and to go through a series of gates. Great, I can do that, and the demo is exactly the gameplay I'm after. So now I buy the game. Not long into it and I find now that I have to paas through the gates and collect rings that appear, else the game will be quickly over. Hmmmm, I don't remember any rings when I was skiing for real! And that's what I have to do on the first course, plus avoid the sheet load of rocks. I'm finding it difficult to steer and control my speed. This doesn't feel like skiing and is a stark difference in difficulty to the demo! I'm requesting a refund.","Good Game. But there is one disappointing thing. In a real ski race, the gate you must go through is made with two SAME COLOR Frags (or Poles). It is not the DIFFERENT COLORS as in this game. That is a basic rule in skiing","The music, the simple beautiful setting, the feeling of rushing down a mountain in full control of your motion, the progression. This is my most played game in vr. I cannot recommend enough to anyone who something completely different to the normal vr stuff out there. A true hidden gem. Hopefully there will be a follow up!",I really enjoy skiing but for some reason this game isnt for me. I bought this game a few hours ago and im bored. For some reason it doesnt let me refund the game if i played it for 30 mins max.
