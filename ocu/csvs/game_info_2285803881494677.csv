I love the attachments and the different guns. And all for a good price. Definitely a buy üëç. 25 0/0 off: bit(dot)ly/OculusDisc Replace the (dot) with a period Please like the post it really helps!!!,"First of all the graphics of the game are amazing. Never experienced lag or bugs in the time I‚Äôve been playing. Huge arrange of weapons to unlock, lots of different attachments and many different missions. This game is easily one of my favorites. Don‚Äôt knock it till you try it. You can always refund","Cool game! Lots of fun to play. I only have 3 remarks about it. The 2 hands pistol animation is a bit buggy and I need to hold the controllers uncomfortably close together to get the game to hold it with 2 hands. Second, the sandbox is very buggy but I do believe that it is still in beta so that's understandable. Third remark, I'd love to have some scoreboard of all players. I'm really competitive in this game so I'd like to compete and get the fastest time. Very cool game","This game is no JOKE! REAL TO THE CORE! If you like playing with guns, you absolutely NEED THIS GAME! Every weapon has all add-on parts; lights, beams, scopes, grenade propelled shooter, stocks, muzzles, grips, ammo, Xtra size magazines, etc. Drop the old clip, while having the new one waiting in your left hand, as it falls, throw it in & load it, for perfect reloads. Toss a gun from your left hand & catch it in ur right hand, to perform military style trained moves. IF YOU A LIKE GUNS-THIS GAME'S UR CLUB!","So let me start off by saying I truly love this game, Shure it's not h3vr but it gets the job done. before I enquired a quest 2 I played on the PSVR 1(the one with very flashy lights) and I really enjoyed it so I bought the SWAT dlc and it was amazing, from new guns to entirely an new map to take down evil enemies. So now that I have got a quest 2 the first game I got (besides bonelab and free beatsaber) was of course Gun Club VR. It took a while but I got round to playing it and it was even better than before. There was only one problem- I couldn't have the same gun Club VR account as on the PSVR 1. So if I wanted the SWAT dlc I would have to spend another ¬£5.99 to play with it. I would suggest that u get a code to share an account over 2 devices. This might not only help me but maybe people with the same problem. If you think this should be a feature make Shure to leave a like so it's more likely for the devs to seeüëç"
