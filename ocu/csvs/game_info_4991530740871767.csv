Hypnosis Reveries,"""The creator of HYPNOSIS REVERIES perfectly integrates imagination and new technology with VR media, takes root in modern cities, and deeply explores the social reality facing young people today. It is a rare reflection and expression in Chinese works."" WINNER of the Best Chinese Work at the Sandbox Immersive Festival 2021. Official Selection of Panorama Unit at the 11th Beijing International Film Festival. Based on the Jessien's interdisciplinary research in VR related fields over the past decade, HYPNOSIS REVERIES takes an abstract and minimalist approach to tell a story about growing. Through a 20-minute exploration experience, you will step into a mental maze, looking back at the important moments that changed you, and see yourself again. * HYPNOSIS REVERIES is originally a large-space VR experience using a redirected walking algorithm invented by Jessien. ** The current version available on Quest Lab/Store is a remade version, supporting Standing and Sitting modes.",3+,Single User,"Standing, Sitting",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Art/Creativity, Narrative",English,0.2,Jessien,Jes Studio,https://hypnosis.art/,"Mar 14, 2022","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/4991530740871767/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=4991530740871767&r=1, https://hypnosis.art/privacy-policy/",287.5 MB,It's the stupidest and most boring app I've come across so far. I'm sorry for the money I gave it!,"For those who don't know the background. The dev is a Chinese artist who works on VR experiences. This seemingly very abstract piece of artwork is a reflexive work about his experience of growing up and undergoing changes in the modern day Chinese society. As a Chinese myself, the representation of the process of a soul's change as it faces the prevalent and permeating disciplinary power and the suffocating narrative about 'the normative life of a Chinese young adult' resonate greatly with my own experience. It even reminds me of Michel Foucault's works on power, discourse and the modern subjectivity. In addition, the spatial design is just magnificent. You will experience the feeling of being lost in a maze filled with deeply meaningful artefacts. Very well done, and highly recommended!","The work has a very simple but subtle space. During the experience, you can experience the author describing a profound topic with extreme restraint. I am impressed with the author's use of space for narrative. Although the price is not low, it is recommended to give it a try.",I tested the app and it is an amazing visual experience. Great interactive design with a relaxing experience. It's still in development and I can only imagine what cool updates are to follow. Looking forward to the full experience. Good job devs!,Its great experiece and also great music. But i think 4.99 € is the better price for the Game. For 10€ is too short for me...
