It is really well done and I learn quite a lot of vocabulary. I just wish there was 1-3 lines of explications what each part are for.,"This is an awesome app to practice the exterior walkaround of the A320. Thanks for releasing it for private use for student pilots! In the future it'd be nice to have an option to move your character around instead of using the set viewpoints. Also an option to turn off the voice and arrow guides to check your memorization of locations. And lastly some more details around the plane would be nice, like an airport environment (even if low quality) to add some extra immersion. Really appreciate being able to try this out for free for AppLab launch week and would be happy to pay for an updated app at some point with more features. Keep up the great work!"
