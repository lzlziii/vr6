Hellish Gate,"You are embarking on the road to the netherworld where you will fight with all kinds of enemies. If you pass all levels, you will be reborn as a human being under the care of God. During each level, if you see a huge scallop, enter it, and you will then move on to the next level. If you can't find one, touch a giant conch and follow its hints on how to get past the current level. Press the ""X"" button to move. Press the right trigger to fire.",3+,"Single User, Multiplayer, Co-op","Sitting, Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Adventure, Fighting, Shooter",English,1.35,kfz shj,kfz shj,http://43.135.146.122:8888/home.html,"https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3889832521115203/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store&item_id=3889832521115203&r=1, http://43.135.146.122:8888/privacy.html",393.0 MB,not a bad game as long as you have the space to trun around physically….REALLY wish it had the toggle option to turn…please add this…..not everyone can move freely,Understanding the story design of the game requires an understanding of eastern culture.
