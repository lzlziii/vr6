Audioshield,"Audioshield is the music game for your entire music collection. Just download your songs using the Quest's Browser, launch Audioshield, and play with your own music! It also comes with 20 great songs ready to go. Experience your entire music collection in VR. Audioshield puts you at the point of impact for every hit in your music. Beats glide in slowly for mellow parts of songs, then ramp up for intense parts of songs with cross-body, double-shield, and high-altitude hits. Audioshield uses an advanced version of Audiosurf's music analysis system to automatically sync with any song from your collection. Every song has its own online leaderboard. Punch hard, but don't miss, to get the top scores. -- Update 4.30.2020 -- - Transparent shields - Subfolder browsing (Music folder only) - New option: decrease distant orb height - New option: smooth incoming orb speed - New option: reverse colors - New option: hide purple shield",12+,Single User,Standing,Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",Games,", Arcade, Music & Rhythm","English, French (France), German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish (Argentina), Spanish (Chile), Spanish (Colombia), Spanish (Mexico), Spanish (Peru), Spanish (Puerto Rico), Spanish (Venezuela)",136,Dylan Fitterer,"Audiosurf, LLC",http://audio-shield.com/,"Apr 16, 2020","https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/1924930950878181/?utm_source=oculusapplab.com&store=quest&item_id=1924930950878181&r=1, https://audio-surf.com/Quest/AudioshieldonOculusQuestPrivacyPolicy.html",584.7 MB,"The game is absolutely perfect and custom tracks is the icing on the Cake. Advice to those stuck on loading custom tracks, there I enough literature and instructions online in forums, discord feeds, even comments. Learn to Google and look them up as it takes less time and yield better results than contacting Developers. Everything work flawlessly and still outperforms modern adaptions of these kind of games. It's a music, rhythm, fit, lite boxing all in one utility /trainer/game that never gets old. Thank you developers.","I can‚Äôt figure out how to download my music to this game and that is all I got the game for. If I can‚Äôt figure out how to to do that, I will refund the game. I am very disappointed in this experience. :(",Dylan is a genius! How cool is it to be able to listen to your own songs? This app exceeds my expectations. And adding songs to the app ‚Ä¶piece of cake. This is my new addiction. It makes me want to make music again! THANKS DYLAN! I have original music on SoundClick. I went to the browser in Oculus and accessed Soundclick and downloaded my music. I then open Audioshield and the music was there under Downloaded songs.,"HoNeStLy AnD CoNsCiOuSLy ThiS iS EvErY GaMe iN OnE, CuStOmiZe YoUr MuSiC, ExCeRciSe AnD ReLiEvE StReSs OfFLiNe, MuSiC iS LiFe, i HaD AuDioTiLt On My ZuNe HD, ThEn i GoT MuSiVeRsE On My AnDrOiD, I HaVe FuSeR, DaNcE CeNtRaL, DiSnEy FaNtAsiA, FoRzA HoRiZoN, On XbOx KiNeCt, AlL ThiNgS MuSiC FeStiVaL, ThiS iS ThE PeRfEcT GaMe FoR ThE OcULuS QuEsT, HiGhLy ReCoMmEnD iT, ThAnK YoU HoLy SpiRiT FoR PaSsiNg GiFt To Us ThRoUgh DyLan, KeEp uP ThE GrEaT WoRkS, i HoPe YoU AnD YoUrS ArE AlLwAyS SaTiSfiEd AnD CoMfOrTaBLe XpEriEnCiNg ThE HiGhEsT QuALiTiEs Of LiFe HoNeStLy AnD CoNsCiOuSLy üíêü¶ãüååüíóüèûÔ∏èü¶ãüíê üññü•∞ ‚úåÔ∏èüòÅ ‚òùÔ∏èüòå",I love that I can listen to my own music and I don‚Äôt have to pay for a ‚Äúpack‚Äù to hear some musician . It can handle FLAC files no problem. Drawbacks are: it doesn‚Äôt make you move your feet. Not always well synchronized with the music. Could use some more backdrops. It takes a few steps to download a song but I don‚Äôt find it too tedious. Would be nice if you didn‚Äôt have to do it one by one.
