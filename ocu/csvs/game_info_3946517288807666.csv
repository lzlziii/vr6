Brick Attack,"The modern reimagination of the retro breakout game, Brick Attack has intuitive controls to make it easy for anyone to pick up. However, every time you hit a brick, it flies out of the frame straight at your head! Make sure to dodge the brick before it hits you, but wait - don't lose your concentration on the ball!",3+,Single User,"Standing, Roomscale",Touch Controllers,"Quest, Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro",", Arcade",English,"0.1.6

But the worst part by FAR is how the paddle DECELERATES when you bring it against the left or right wall; it slows down significantly so that you can't catch the ball in time if it was heading right to that corner. I lost two lives quickly due to this, and there doesn't appear to be any way to remove the deceleration (which still occurs even if you set the paddle movement speed to max). I also had option selection problems and couldn't seem to choose between the 5 colored blocks in the upper-right (I'm assuming those were environments/themes). The core concept of the game is great but the execution here was so bad that I regrettably uninstalled within 10 min. Hopefully these issues will be addressed in a future update."
