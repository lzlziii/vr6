The difficulty of the levels is gradually increasing and it's so much fun guiding the little guys through the levels. It's different from Lemmings and the like as sometimes you have the move the tiles while spuds run. I assume there are like 60 levels which will take me some time to reach as now I'm somewhere in the 20ies where the 3 star ratings are not easy to achieve. Overall, a nice game for the times in between. Go to ocuyou on the link tree to get this one and some others with a rebate.","Update: I finished all the levels (most with three stars), except for the last one (60)... that one is crazy hard. I would love to know what's up with those particular fans, lasers and stuff. Now I am so sad... I really enjoyed this great game that incorporated fun with strategic thinking. Please please... more?! And if you haven't played it yet, you definitely have a treat ahead of you! Original: What is not to love about helping as many of these adorable little spuds as you can? I love the way the game teaches you the basics through the levels. I also like the way you can strategize where to put the assists before releasing the spuds on their journey. I am only on level 20, though, so I understand the time factor on those does ramp up. The graphics are lovely (I especially like that the background changes at each attempt - yes, I do sometimes have multiple attempts on a level ;-) ). I find myself playing this just to chill with the little guys to the pleasant music and graphics. I do sorta hate that you can't save them all if you want to get all the stars. Sorry little spuds - it's not personal :-)","Everyone who knows ""Lemmings"" should bei familiar with the gameplay concept, everyone who doesnt know it: you need to Guide Auto Walking NPCs in The correct direction so they reach The Goal instead of dying. The First 15-20 Levels are pretty easy and build Like a Tutorial so you can familiarize with the different Objects and gameplay mechanics but after Level 20 you are up to some pretty challenging Puzzles (at least If you want to reach 3 Stars in every Level) which do not only Challenge your brain but also your reactions as you need to alter The path of your Spuds while they are Walking. If i do Not mistake The Menu it seems Like there are 60 Levels to Beat with increasing difficulty, which is a good amount of Content for this Type of Game. The Graphics are Basic but very pretty and The Animations are lovely and funny, also The Music/Sound Matches the Game pretty Well and have a Catch to it. I want to mention that i won this Game via The Facebook group ""Meta Quest VR Family"" which Had No influence on my Review! I want to thank the Developer for Providing The Key and Hope to See more games in The Future :)","You responded to my demo review finally, informing me that I could finally buy the full game, but I had already beat you to it. I had kartoffl’s release date set in my calendar since it was announced. I threw my money at you as fast as I possibly could! Literally within the 1st minute of its release Lol It’s perfect so far! So worth the wait. Buy it people. It’s worth $30 honestly. $15 is a steal UPDATE: Now that I’ve had some more time to play, im really loving the controls. They seem much simpler than in the demo, which was my only small complaint. I’ve completed the first 20 levels and so far it’s a blast. Polished, zero bugs, this game is LEGIT. Think Lemmings, only much better",Love it!
