This is like a fluid boxing movement that really engages your core with twisting and punching. Even without a full game, the gameplay alone has me intrigued enough and feels natural enough to keep playing and moving. I find myself pushing to get all the rings and once I achieve that just slightly bumping up the difficulty with one of the sliders. At the lower levels, it's great as a warm up, but then pushes you to the limits of how fast you can react with the harder difficulties. I'm impressed, will have to try the coop soon with friends, and listen to music while I play.","Amazing game / potential!! But without some sort of level / score reward system it feels ""pointless"" quickly despite the addictive nature of it.","My initial reaction was, ""I have no idea what I am doing, nor why, but I feel like I'm way too good at it""... Then I found the difficulty setting :) Speaking of which, the settings are in kind of an inconvenient spot - I kept opening them by accident! (In fact thats how I found the difficulty setting) It's fun for a bit and certainly gets you moving, once you figure out what you are supposed to be doing! Needs some game modes or something.. Infinite mode to just play as-is, maybe a mode with gradually increasing difficulty... Has a long way to go but seems a good starting concept :)","This game is like boxing meets squash. It also gets you jumping and squatting when you really get into it. Excellent base concept and I have no problem getting in 30 minutes of sweaty cardio with this app. I do hope the devs add some basic features like score counting, timer, environments, etc in the near future. Great job all!",This game is a good workout but it's boring. I played 15 mn but it's always the same. Why haven't your Dev students thought of a simple scoreboard? It would have allowed me to challenge my friends! So impossible to give more than 3 stars !!!!
