Gameplay is pretty much what you expect, pure joy. A few suggestions: Would be good if we could choose different kaiju to possess. The pop could be hidden behind fog. Would be cool if there were little humans Running from you","Video first impression review: https://youtu.be/4x62OkPdrf0 Kaiju Monster VR demo felt great. I took the form of a large Kaiju monster, smashing and wreaking havoc on buildings and army units with my own fists in virtual reality. I love the stylized low-poly city look (although I really felt like smashing things in a hyper-realistic one as well). I didn't find a way to climb buildings though, and as a big fan of the retro arcade game ""Rampage"", this is something I want to do as well. First impressions are very positive, and I really like games that take a different perspective, either making you huge or tiny. From what I read, there are a total of five themed cities with three difficulty levels in the final. I am enjoying the demo so far. I see myself continuing to smash things in VR and taking on the challenge."
