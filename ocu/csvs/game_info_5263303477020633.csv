I played this five minutes and immediately got two more copies for friends. Get in the main store!! Update: Played with friends and there are issues. Easy to connect to a custom room (like walkabout), gameplay is fun. However, 1. There is overlapping music when starting and dying -- cut or pause one when playing a new one! 2. Music is so loud we can't talk. It is cool music so give us a volume slider please! 3. The player list won't scroll for me. Basically this game is the bomb (people still say that right?) but needs some basic quality of life updates.","18/11/22 very good with the new update! 5 stars! I would also like two handed mode with two worms if possible. I would also like a difficulty option (in the menu) that makes food disappear seconds after it appears so you have little food scattered around the level, so it forces the player to move more while catching less food, also poisonous food of a slightly different color, easily confused at a first glance with healthy food, so as to force the player to pay greater attention, but not particularly punitive: in fact, if you eat this poisonous food you only lose a certain amount of score and the worm it slows down and can't keep up with your hand speed for a while, before returning to normal ----- Update: perfect! Now i go ti download It! 5 stars and new review in coming!!!.... ----- Latest update ruined the game: auto vacuuming food from a distance makes the game too easy and lazy, please correct or create various game modes easy, normal, difficult otherwise this game has lost all value.","Let’s start out by stating the most important Space Slurpies is a VR version of the popular worm genre games that came preloaded on all your old school Nokia phones. You begin playing as a small color customizable Slurpie (worm) and by navigating around the map you gobble up food to grow both armor and larger in size. Joining you on the map are three other Slurpies (AI or Human). Race to the food and too grow, the Slurpie that last the longest wins. If you are a fan of Snake games this is a grab for sure. There are over 30 levels to unlock in solo mode but are fully unlocked in Zen mode that provide a nice change of visuals while you game. The games soundtrack has some grove too it. If you stay in the menu too long you will no doubt find your head bouncing as you pick your next map. When I started playing I said I was just going to give this game a quick try as I am not the biggest fan of “snake games” and it didn’t feel long at all before I got the notification that my headset was dying. A great escape from the plethora of FPS, Zombie Bashers, and Music Games that load all of our libraries. Also bonus points for being a solid game for new VR users. This is a safe slower paced game to get a new user used to movement and in my personal experience caused no motion sickness.

Its exciting, nerve wracking, customisable and smooth gameplay leaves nothing to the imagination. Starcade arcade have taken elements to make its an amazing game to play alone or with friends…. And of course DJ Inkers throwing out those mad beats in the menu. Go buy it now and see for yourself.","I don’t think people understand just how addictive this game can be. You start off by “trying it out”, then an hour later you’re building up a sweat, arm burning, but you can’t stop! You’re are tripping over your dog trying to snag all the edibles for yourself without eating your enormous body!! (You’ll have to play to understand) It’s zen, it’s fun, it’s catchy and the devs are awesome to follow on social media as well! Well deserved claps for this game."
