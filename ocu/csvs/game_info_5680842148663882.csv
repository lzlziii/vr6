Every time I put my VR on, this is one of the first games I play. Although the graphics are low-poly it still really great. Definitely worth it.","This indi poly game is a fantastic game. With this studio you will revive D-Day like Medal of Honor Allied Assault (or wwii call of duty D-day) but with poly graphics and severals and varied chapters, where you will go in different transports, you will use many iconic weapons, you will be a sniper with slow motion if you bring your rifle closer to your sight... You can see the taste and effort to do something good. I think it's the best game in length, variety and replayability with Poly aesthetics I've seen. Incredible first game for a studio. keep it upüç∫",Good game‚Ä¶,"One of the better WW2 games I've played on Quest 2! Hope they add more content of battles after D-Day. I would pay for that, just throwing that out there lol","Definitely the best ww2 game on vr I've played. I love the large intense fights as well as the infantry based combat. One minor setback is that for me, the hand poses on the kar 98, m1903 sniper and BAR are glitching so hopefully you can fix that. Are you guys planning any after launch content?if so I have some suggestions: Ability to play as more factions e.g. British and german. or you could maybe make a whole new game for new factions or time periods."
