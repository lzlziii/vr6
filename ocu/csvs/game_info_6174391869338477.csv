I usually love games remade in VR, but the controls are SO BAD. If you've played gorilla tag, it's similar, just worse. You jump with both hands hitting the ground, not one. To walk, it's the same is gorilla tag, but you're practically stuck to the floor and glide across it when you do so. There's also a boost mechanic and it's even more broken than the walking. You press the triggers midair to boost, but sometimes it doesn't even try. It will literally propel you downward for no reason and make you lose a lot of progress. I've gotten up to the subway trains where the music changes, but the frequent jumps + boost makes it super easy to fall considering how broken all the mechanics are. I fell 3 different times from there, all because of the boost not working properly, and I climbed all the way back up each time. On my last ascension, I tried to pause it when I got back to the trains. That's how I learned the pause button takes you back to the beginning for no reason. Yeah. Obviously I gave up because I had JUST gotten back to my spot and it reset. I'm not gonna say this isn't worth a shot, because the idea of the game is cool. Had the mechanics not been broken, this could've been a solid knockoff of only up that I would play regardless of its originality. I could care less if you completely ripoff a game, but at least TRY to polish it. This is the only game I've ever played on oculus when the jumping mechanic is shotty, and that says a lot.","The controls are a bit hard to get used to but once you do this game is so fun to speedrun. I think I am the world record holder and I am trying to get this game into speedrun.com. Maybe check out my youtube channel, search “waffle099” because I just uploaded my sub 2:20 run. Can’t wait for the full game!","I love the game, but I will admit when I first started. I hated the locomotion, but when I got used to the locomotion the was game so much fun sure the locomotion can use a few tweaks, but this game has great potential and it’s only a demo, so I can’t wait to see what’s in the future.",It's good but add multi player,"If you spam the boost while looking up you can practically fly so maybe try making it not boost straight up, only straight forward..."
